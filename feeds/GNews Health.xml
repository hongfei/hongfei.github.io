			&lt;p&gt;There's a parasite living in the brains of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-us-still-doesnt-test-for-this-common-harmful-parasite-during-pregnancy"&gt;40 million Americans&lt;/a&gt;, and most of these human hosts are completely unaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors don't usually treat this bug unless it begins wreaking havoc on the bodies of patients with weakened immune systems, but a new discovery may make short work of the invader without the typical risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitologist Rajshekhar Gaji runs a lab at the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine, investigating what makes the parasite, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cat-parasite-can-seriously-disrupt-brain-function-study-suggests"&gt;Cat Parasite Can Seriously Disrupt Brain Function, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The parasite that's sitting in the brain gets reactivated, starts multiplying, and then it's fatal," Gaji &lt;a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/10/vetmed-research-parasite.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. "Because of that, the parasite is a dreaded pathogen." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;is closely associated with cats, which are the only known hosts within which the parasite can reproduce sexually. But once its offspring are shed in the cat's poop, there are very few warm-blooded species &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; won't make a home in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of us, an infection with &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;will fall &lt;span&gt;completely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;under the radar. For those with cancer, HIV, or who are on immunosuppressants, the parasite presents significant risks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a healthy immune system to keep &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;at bay, these patients can quickly develop a disease known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis"&gt;toxoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;, which can bring flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, and brain inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite can also be transmitted to the placenta of a developing fetus during pregnancy. This form of the disease, congenital toxoplasmosis, can cause developmental problems, and even miscarriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments for acute toxoplasmosis involve medications that target mechanisms in the parasite that are biologically similar to processes in our own bodies. This often puts patients at risk of severe side effects, restricting treatments to situations where infections are considered to be dire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaji and his team might have found a lead, though: in a new study, they&lt;span&gt; have shown that switching off just a single protein inside the microscopic parasite can kill it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein, &lt;span&gt;TgAP2X-7, appears to be essential to the parasite's ability to invade a host, form plaques, and self-replicate. To prove this, the team genetically modified some parasites so that their TgAP2X-7 proteins function normally unless &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxin"&gt;auxin&lt;/a&gt; (a plant hormone that regulates growth) is added, in which case the proteins would quickly degrade. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Auxin, they established prior, had no impact on &lt;em&gt;T. gondii &lt;/em&gt;growth or plaque formation on its own, so any effect it had on the genetically modified parasites could be attributed to the fact that the TgAP2X-7 proteins had been destroyed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deprived of &lt;span&gt;TgAP2X-7, the parasites couldn't form plaques, and their ability to invade hosts (which, in this lab study, were human foreskin cells) was severely impaired. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Usually, they have a near-100 percent success rate invading these kinds of cells, but without that key protein, success dropped to below 50 percent. They also struggled to replicate.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178106" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-642x256.jpg" alt="Scientists Have Found The Protein Switch That Drives Widespread Brain Parasite" class="wp-image-178106 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-642x256.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-1200x478.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-768x306.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-1536x612.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004-600x239.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/msphere.00438-25.f004.jpg 1877w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178106" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Strains that had their TgAP2X-7 destroyed (B) were unable to propagate at the same rate as those with the protein intact (A).

"That shows this particular transcription factor is essential for the parasite to survive within the host."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

So it is troubling that multiple studies suggest men’s testosterone levels are tanking worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; traced a “substantial” drop in men’s testosterone levels since 1987, at a rate of 1% each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another paper in &lt;em&gt;European Urology Focus&lt;/em&gt; found that 20% of younger men now have low testosterone levels. What is happening? And is this cause for mass male panic?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern men – particularly athletes with a keen interest in physical performance – deserve an urgent hormonal health update, beginning with a clarification of why testosterone matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving growth through early life, in adulthood it supports everything from sperm production to red blood cell creation, muscle strength, bone density, memory performance and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1124672639.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945056"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Testosterone helps red blood cell production – crucial to endurance athletes such as cyclists. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A worldwide drop, then, is bad news for men’s health, with studies linking it to heart problems, obesity, high cholesterol, diabetes, anaemia, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, infertility and sleep disturbances, plus mental issues such as irritability, low energy, poor self-esteem and weak concentration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, low testosterone is now associated with a 35-40% higher risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanations for this disturbing global decline range from the ageing population to sedentary jobs and the side-effects of drugs such as antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But almost all experts agree the drop is linked primarily to unhealthy modern lifestyles and the rise in obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seminal European Male Ageing study found that 2.1% of men aged 40-79 suffer from medically low testosterone (low enough to require treatment), but another 20% experience sub-optimal testosterone levels (not low enough to require medical treatment, but still likely to impair their everyday health). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for most of those men, low testosterone was linked to existing health problems, such as obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It fits the narrative that worldwide we are overall less healthy than we were,” explains Dr Channa Jayasena, a specialist in reproductive endocrinology at Imperial College London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The men with the lowest levels of testosterone tended to be the ones who are the least fit, who have obesity, who are on the most medications or who are most ill.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, for most modern men with low testosterone, the issue is the result – not the cause – of their other health problems. “To a certain extent, you can lower your chances of low testosterone by incorporating health promotion into your life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In medical terms, low testosterone is diagnosed through a combination of blood tests and symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A normal level ranges from around 8-10 nmol/L (nanomoles per litre) of blood to 30-31nmol/L. And symptoms include fatigue, depression, anxiety, irritability, low libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced strength, night sweats and poor memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low testosterone can be caused by genetic conditions, injuries and hormonal disorders. But for most men, lifestyle factors appear to be the primary cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that men do experience a natural but harmless drop in testosterone as they age, at a rate of 2-3% per year, from the age of 30 onwards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-2218546877.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945062"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Testosterone declines naturally (and harmlessly) with age, but early and more consequential drops need addressing. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the oft-cited media term ‘male menopause’ is misleading. All menstruating women experience the menopause, which involves a rapid decline in hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most men do not suffer from low testosterone, while most age-related hormonal changes are slow and inconsequential. “You shouldn’t expect to be the same man at 80 as you were at 18,” says Dr Jayasena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the 2.1% of men who have medically low testosterone levels, help is available through the NHS in the form of testosterone injections, gels or patches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are among the 20% of modern men who have sub-optimal testosterone levels (low but not requiring medical intervention), positive lifestyle changes can help you get back on track. Here are 15 science-backed strategies to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blast belly fat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1205492768.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945078"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Belly fat increases your chances of low testosterone. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that obesity is a major cause of low testosterone. That is because body fat contains an enzyme that converts testosterone into the female sex hormone, oestrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, one American research paper found that every one-point increase in a man’s Body Mass Index (BMI) is associated with a 2% decrease in testosterone. Gynecomastia – the medical term for ‘man boobs’ – is one sign of this hormonal imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes the solution pretty simple: from cutting down on saturated fats in your diet, to cranking up your fat-burning workouts, losing body fat can revitalise your testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reassuring study by the Endocrine Society found that when 900 overweight men shed weight, they slashed their chances of low testosterone by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lift dumbbells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifting weights will crank up your testosterone, according to a study in the Asian Journal of Sports Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multi-muscle compound movements such as squats and deadlifts are particularly effective, according to Pennsylvania State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lifting heavy weights at 80-85% of your one-rep max also works well, according to the University of Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the good news is that any weight training will help. A study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Human Reproduction&lt;/em&gt; found that even moderate-intensity weight training elevates testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the results can be fast: a Spanish study found that men who did strength training three days a week enjoyed elevated testosterone levels after just four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Crank up the cardio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Routine cardiovascular exercise will elevate your hormonal health and burn off testosterone-wrecking body fat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Japanese study found that men who engaged in aerobic exercise for up to 90 minutes per day, three times per week, experienced a rise in testosterone after just 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;HIIT your hormones hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/11-02-07CYP414_201123ss7254-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945085"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;High intensity turbo sessions are a recipe for testosterone building. &lt;span&gt;Steve Sayers/Our Media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-intensity interval training (HIIT), such as 10x 30-second sprints or sweaty indoor spin classes, will protect your hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paper in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found that three HIIT sessions a week spiked testosterone by 36% after only eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Follow the Mediterranean diet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite wacky claims in dark corners of the internet, there is no magic food ingredient that will boost your testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a healthy overall diet will protect your hormonal health. A study in &lt;em&gt;Current Research In Food Science&lt;/em&gt; found that men who adopted a Mediterranean diet significantly increased their testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on fruit, veg, whole grains, fish, lean meat and healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado and nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dodge inflammatory food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/GettyImages-1391487524.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945089"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Regular highly processed food is a testosterone killer. &lt;span&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect your testosterone by cutting down on inflammatory foods, such as processed foods, high-glycaemic-index food (such as refined carbohydrates) and saturated fat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; linked a high consumption of pastries, desserts and takeaways with low testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eat more oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all fat is bad. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in salmon, mackerel and sardines, have been shown to help with testosterone synthesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fatty acids support cell membranes in the testes, where testosterone is produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t get too skinny&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endurance athletes beware: shifting excess body fat is good for your hormonal health, but turning yourself into a skeleton is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is produced from cholesterol, and severe calorie restriction will impair its production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by the Universities of Worcester and Warwick found a strong link between low-fat diets and low testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Get some daily vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/CYP_bigride_Guernsey_-100-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945090"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Plenty of sun exposure means cyclists needn't worry about vitamin D levels. &lt;span&gt;Joseph Branston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news for cyclists and runners: several studies link outdoor exercise with healthy testosterone levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be because it boosts vitamin D – the ‘sunshine vitamin’ which is produced when skin is exposed to sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research in the journal&lt;em&gt; Hormone and Metabolic Research &lt;/em&gt;has linked healthy vitamin D levels to higher testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over winter, consider using a supplement: a study in the &lt;em&gt;World Journal of Men’s Health&lt;/em&gt; linked vitamin D supplements with increased testosterone levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Zero in on zinc&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc, an essential mineral found in red meat, poultry, beans, oats, eggs, nuts and grains, supports healthy testosterone production, which is why research in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found low zinc levels are linked to a drop in testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most men can get enough zinc from a balanced diet. But consider a supplement if your diet is zinc-deficient: research suggests vegetarians and vegans are most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cut back on booze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad news for boozers: testosterone levels can drop within just 30 minutes of consuming alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian research found that heavy drinking disrupts the body’s hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity, and causes inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to a decline in testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick to the NHS guidelines of no more than 14 units (6 pints of 4% beer) per week. But the less, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eat more green leafy veg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your dinner plate greener. Cruciferous vegetables – such as broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale and brussels sprouts – contain the phytonutrient indole-3-carbinol (I3C), which helps the body eliminate estradiol – a testosterone-damaging oestrogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Get 7-8 hours of sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testosterone and sleep are intertwined. Most testosterone release occurs during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a lack of sleep also releases the stress hormone cortisol, which blocks testosterone production. The University of Chicago found that men who got only five hours of sleep suffered a 10-15% drop in testosterone the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/39/2025/10/CYP_PBP_JB_-34-scaled.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt class="wp-image-945094"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Clocking up big mileage means cyclists can often fall sleep any time, any place. &lt;span&gt;Joseph Branston&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve your sleep by sticking to a regular sleep routine: research in Andrology found that 7-8 hours per night is a healthy target for middle-aged men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Learn to chill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just a bad night’s kip that will mangle your testosterone levels: research in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Molecular Bioscience&lt;/em&gt; found stress also spikes the testosterone-hampering hormone cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So whether you tune into classical radio or enjoy walks in the park, allocate dedicated time each day to soothing your frazzled mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t overtrain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise supports hormonal health, but don’t overdo it with extreme endurance training or excessive HIIT workouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study in Andrology found that recreational athletes who trained 4-5 hours per week enjoy better hormonal health than elite athletes who train 4-5 days per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always bank plenty of rest days: your hormones depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

When animals eat other animals, the heavier nitrogen-15 slowly builds up in their bodies. That means animals that eat meat have more nitrogen-15 than plant eaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In most Neanderthal specimens that have been analyzed, the nitrogen-15 content was higher than those measured in large carnivores, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/oldest-evidence-of-neanderthals-hunting-cave-lions-dates-to-48000-years-ago-punctured-bones-reveal" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/oldest-evidence-of-neanderthals-hunting-cave-lions-dates-to-48000-years-ago-punctured-bones-reveal"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cave lions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cave hyenas or wolves," Bocherens told Live Science in an email. "The conclusion was that Neanderthals were 'more carnivore than the carnivores' (hypercarnivores)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he added, this interpretation is too simple. Nitrogen levels can vary depending on which animals Neanderthals ate, not just how much meat they consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/56678-woolly-mammoth-facts.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/56678-woolly-mammoth-facts.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Woolly mammoths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; consistently exhibit the highest nitrogen-15 levels among herbivores, probably due to the consumption of plants with high nitrogen-15 levels," Bocherens said. The data suggest that Neanderthals were predators that consumed a higher proportion of mammoths than they did of other carnivores in the ecosystem, Bocherens added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt7466" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offered a different explanation for Neanderthals' unusually high nitrogen-15 levels: They may have eaten maggots, either by accident, in the process of eating rotting meat, or on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both rotting meat and especially maggots feasting on the rotting meat have high nitrogen levels and any Neandertal eating those foods regularly would have an isotopic signature that is off the charts," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/anthropology/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/nowell-april.php" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/anthropology/faculty-staff/faculty-profiles/nowell-april.php" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;April Nowell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Paleolithic archaeologist and professor of anthropology at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could Neanderthals survive on a solely meat-based diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="2d0e5b8e-eb3a-407e-8f72-b61e89a7c34a"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Archaeologists have found evidence that Neanderthals soaked, pounded and ground lentils, nuts and grasses at Shanidar Cave (pictured here) in what is now Iraq and Franchthi Cave in modern-day Greece. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: ISMAEL ADNAN via Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="1e9c1f72-9a55-4eec-888e-745860bb5aa0"&gt;"They could not if they had a similar physiology as modern humans, which is likely," Bocherens said. "There is a need for dietary sources of energy." Eating too much protein without enough fat and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/51976-carbohydrates.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/51976-carbohydrates.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which supply most of our energy, can lead to a fatal condition known as protein poisoning or "rabbit starvation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their solution, scientists think, was fat. At one 125,000-year-old German site, researchers found evidence that Neanderthals systematically broke animal bones to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/125-000-year-old-fat-factory-run-by-neanderthals-discovered-in-germany" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/human-evolution/125-000-year-old-fat-factory-run-by-neanderthals-discovered-in-germany"&gt;&lt;u&gt;extract fat from bone marrow&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Animal brains were another probable source of fat, Bocherens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When whole carcasses are consumed, including marrow and fat reserves, an animal-based diet is perfectly viable, Slimak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-c8fbee78-c345-4eaf-858d-2c6035142a8d" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="neanderthals-ate-more-than-meat-and-fat-3"&gt;Neanderthals ate more than meat and fat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="6a922547-94bd-426b-87ba-997b0ebac980"&gt;Neanderthals may have found creative ways to balance their nutrition.

"There is extensive evidence for plant eating by Neanderthals," Nowell said.

According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/ask-the-doctor-do-people-on-warfarin-need-to-avoid-vitamin-supplements-that-contain-vitamin-k" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the goal isn’t to avoid vitamin K-rich foods like spinach, kale, or broccoli, but to keep intake consistent so your blood's clotting level (INR) remains stable. Newer anticoagulants such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran don't interact with vitamin K, but anyone on warfarin should always consult their doctor before making dietary or supplement changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin K and bone health: The missing link&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K works with Vitamin D and calcium to strengthen bones.

Low Vitamin K levels reduce osteocalcin activity, weakening bones even when calcium intake is adequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutritionists now consider Vitamin K an essential but often missing piece of most bone-health plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The takeaway on Vitamin K and overall health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K quietly keeps two vital systems balanced: blood clotting and calcium regulation.

However, according to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/counting-steps-is-good-is-combining-steps-and-heart-rate-better-202504173095" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, that number wasn’t based on scientific research but originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. Recent studies suggest that even 4,000 to 7,000 steps per day can improve health and lower the risk of early death. While step counts are helpful, they don’t reflect the intensity or effort of activity. A brisk uphill walk can raise heart rate far more than a slow flat stroll, even if step counts are identical. This is why experts recommend combining step counts with heart rate measurements to get a more accurate picture of fitness and cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combining steps and heart rate: The science behind a new fitness metric&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40156587/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; explored whether combining heart rate and step data could offer a more accurate assessment of fitness and disease risk. The researchers developed a new measure called the daily heart rate per step (DHRPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ratio combines two pieces of information easily collected by most smartwatches or fitness bands: your average daily heart rate and your average daily step count. To calculate your DHRPS, divide your heart rate by your step count. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart rate 80 bpm / 4,000 steps = 0.0200&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart rate 80 bpm / 6,000 steps = 0.0133&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this ratio, lower scores indicate better cardiovascular fitness, as they show your heart needs fewer beats to support your activity level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found: Higher DHRPS means higher disease risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved nearly 7,000 participants, with an average age of 55, all wearing Fitbit devices that continuously tracked their heart rate and steps over five years, a total of more than 50 billion steps. When researchers compared participants’ DHRPS ratios with their health outcomes, they found strong associations between higher DHRPS scores and an increased risk of chronic diseases, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure (hypertension)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary artery disease and heart failure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stroke&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with lower DHRPS values tended to report better overall health, while those with higher values performed worse on exercise stress tests, showing poorer endurance. In short, your DHRPS score could be a better indicator of how efficiently your heart supports physical activity than steps or heart rate alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding your DHRPS score and what it reveals about your heart and overall health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers categorised DHRPS results into three groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low: 0.0081 or lower (best cardiovascular fitness)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medium: between 0.0081 and 0.0147&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High: 0.0147 or higher (higher disease risk)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lower DHRPS score means your heart works more efficiently relative to your movement. For example, if your DHRPS drops from 0.0200 to 0.0133 after a few weeks of increased walking, that’s a sign your fitness is improving. However, it’s important to remember that this is a new and emerging measure. The study only shows correlation, not causation, meaning it can’t prove that improving your DHRPS will directly lower your risk of heart disease or diabetes. Moreover, the research primarily involved white female participants and didn’t compare DHRPS with established risk factors like cholesterol, smoking, or family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already wear a smartwatch or fitness tracker, calculating your DHRPS could give you a more complete view of your health and motivate you to move more efficiently. It’s a simple ratio, yet it may reveal how your heart and activity work together to influence long-term well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists still need more research to confirm its medical value, this approach reflects a key insight: fitness isn’t just about how far you move, but how your heart responds as you move. By monitoring both steps and heart rate, you can personalise your fitness journey and identify trends that might help prevent disease. In the end, whether you’re aiming for 5,000 or 10,000 steps, focus on staying active, maintaining a healthy heart rate, and making steady progress. The combination of movement and heart awareness could be your best step yet toward lasting health and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

You don’t need 15 supplements, cold plunges every morning, or to cut out every ‘bad’ food to protect your heart and stay young. You need to understand your body — and the root causes of why it’s slowing down, inflamed, or running on empty.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘Your body isn’t failing you. It’s trying to get your attention’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist highlighted that after over 20+ years in medicine, he has seen the same story repeat itself: “High-performing people, business owners, parents, athletes — running on caffeine, stress, and convenience, until their body finally says no more.” It is because people forget to find the root cause of their problems, Dr Bhojraj stressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, the cardiologist stressed that if you’re: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always tired, even after sleep. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiencing chest pressure, shortness of breath, or anxiety that feels ‘different’.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Foggy, inflamed, or just not feeling like yourself anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Using quick fixes to get through the day instead of actually healing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;He highlighted that all of these are not signs that your body is failing you; rather, it’s trying to get your attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The truth is, your heart health isn’t just about cholesterol or blood pressure. It’s about inflammation, hormones, gut health, sleep quality, stress response — all interconnected,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, he emphasised that it is essential to combine advanced diagnostics, personalised functional medicine, and decades of cardiology expertise to help people regain their vitality from the inside out. “Because health isn’t about doing more. It’s about doing what’s right for you,” the cardiologist said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

For many, the way their brains work means they struggle with tasks that require focus and planning, which, at the lower end, means daily stress and inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, it's a recipe for disaster. For example, a&lt;span&gt;dults with ADHD are more at risk &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-10-99"&gt;road accidents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7215254/"&gt;motor vehicle injuries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2810131"&gt;traffic tickets, and hard braking events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies have found that stimulant medications, such as Ritalin, can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-medication-could-literally-add-years-to-some-peoples-lives"&gt;literally add years to some people's lives&lt;/a&gt;. These stimulants &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-do-stimulants-actually-work-to-reduce-adhd-symptoms-215801"&gt;increase the amount of key neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, and improve attention, impulse control and decision-making.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study adds &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-10-99"&gt;further evidence&lt;/a&gt; that these drugs can tackle some of the most serious outcomes people with ADHD face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the &lt;span&gt;Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden led the study, drawing on data from 148,581 patients, ranging from 6 to 64-years-old, who received an ADHD diagnosis between 2007 and 2018. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who started drug treatment (about 57 percent) within three months of diagnosis saw reduced risk across most of the serious outcomes assessed. In about 88 percent of cases, the drug they took was methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication reduced the risk of first-time substance misuse by 15 percent, and recurrent misuse by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reduced first-time suicidal behavior by 17 percent, and subsequent suicide attempts by 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First instances of criminal behavior were reduced by 13 percent, and repeat instances, by 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found medication reduced the risk of first-time traffic accidents by 12 percent, and recurrent events by 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Oftentimes there is no information on what the risks are if you don't treat ADHD," study author and psychiatrist Samuele Cortese, from the University of Southampton, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr2j792drro"&gt;told journalist Philippa Roxby at the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Now we have evidence they [ADHD medications] can reduce these risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2024-083658"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The research found that both random noise and a non-random pure tone had similar effects on a brain activity measure linked to neural noise, which contradicts key assumptions of the prominent moderate brain arousal model. These findings were published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251357074" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have observed that listening to random auditory noise, like white or pink noise, can benefit cognitive functioning in individuals with ADHD or elevated traits of the condition. The moderate brain arousal model was proposed to explain this phenomenon. This model is built on two primary assumptions. First, it suggests that ADHD is associated with lower-than-optimal levels of internal neural noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, it proposes that external random noise boosts this internal neural noise through a mechanism called stochastic resonance, improving the brain’s ability to process signals. However, these foundational ideas had not been sufficiently tested, particularly because most studies lacked a direct measure of neural noise or a proper non-random sound condition to isolate the effects of stochastic resonance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joske Rijmen and her colleagues at Ghent University aimed to directly test these two core assumptions of the moderate brain arousal model. They designed an experiment to measure neural noise directly while participants listened to different types of sound. The researchers wanted to see if ADHD traits were indeed linked to lower neural noise at baseline. They also sought to determine if the effects of sound on brain activity were specific to random noise, as the theory of stochastic resonance would predict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their investigation, the researchers recruited 69 neurotypical adults. Participants first completed the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, a questionnaire used to assess the number and frequency of symptoms associated with the condition. This allowed the scientists to examine ADHD as a spectrum of traits rather than a simple diagnostic category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant then underwent a resting-state electroencephalogram, a non-invasive procedure that records the brain’s electrical activity. While their brain activity was monitored, participants sat with their eyes closed for three distinct two-minute periods: one in silence, one while listening to continuous pink noise (a random signal), and one while listening to a continuous 100 Hz pure tone (a non-random signal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed the electroencephalogram data by focusing on a specific feature known as the aperiodic slope of the power spectral density. This measure reflects background brain activity that is not part of rhythmic brain waves and is considered a direct index of neural noise. A steeper slope in this measurement corresponds to less neural noise, while a flatter slope indicates more neural noise. By examining how this slope changed across the different sound conditions and in relation to participants’ ADHD traits, the scientists could test the predictions of the moderate brain arousal model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings presented a direct challenge to the model’s first assumption. During the silent condition, the researchers found a relationship between ADHD traits and the aperiodic slope. Individuals who reported more traits of ADHD tended to have a flatter slope. This finding suggests that they had more background neural noise, not less. The result is the opposite of what the moderate brain arousal model predicted and aligns with other recent studies that have also found evidence for increased neural noise in older children and adolescents with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also contradicted the model’s second assumption regarding the mechanism of stochastic resonance. When participants with elevated ADHD traits listened to pink noise, their aperiodic slope became steeper. This change signifies a reduction in their neural noise. This outcome is contrary to the model’s suggestion that random noise should increase neural noise in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most significantly, the researchers found that the non-random pure tone had a virtually identical effect on brain activity as the pink noise. Listening to the 100 Hz tone also led to a steeper aperiodic slope, or a decrease in neural noise, in participants with higher levels of ADHD traits. The fact that a non-random sound produced the same effect as a random sound strongly questions the idea that stochastic resonance, which requires a random signal, is the necessary mechanism behind the benefits of auditory stimulation. If stochastic resonance were the driving force, only the pink noise should have produced this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that an alternative explanation may be needed. Rather than relying on stochastic resonance, both types of sound might have a more general effect on brain arousal. This idea is more consistent with the state regulation deficit account of ADHD, which suggests that individuals with the condition have difficulty regulating their arousal levels to match situational demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to this view, any form of additional stimulation, not just random noise, could help modulate arousal to a more optimal state. The researchers also noted the puzzling observation that stimulation appeared to decrease brain arousal in individuals with higher ADHD traits. They speculate this might relate to difficulties these individuals have in achieving a truly restful state, and the continuous sound may have helped them to calm or regulate their brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations that the authors acknowledge. The research was conducted with neurotypical adults who varied in their traits of ADHD, so the findings need to be replicated in a group of individuals with a formal clinical diagnosis. Another point is that the brain activity was measured during a resting state, not while participants were engaged in a cognitive task where the benefits of noise are typically observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should explore whether these same brain activity patterns occur during tasks that require attention and focus. Investigating these effects in a clinical sample of people with diagnosed ADHD will be an important next step to confirm these conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251357074" target="_blank"&gt;Pink Noise and a Pure Tone Both Reduce 1/f Neural Noise in Adults With Elevated ADHD Traits: A Critical Appraisal of the Moderate Brain Arousal Model&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Joske Rijmen, Mehdi Senoussi, and Jan R.

							&lt;p&gt;There’s no shortage of supplements claiming to boost focus, sharpen memory, or keep your brain young.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the truth. No pill can replace what real daily habits do for your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain isn’t a static organ. It’s constantly adapting, responding, and reshaping itself based on what you do, eat, think, and feel. Research in psychology shows that lifestyle choices have far greater effects on brain health than any supplement ever could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to protect your brain long-term, start with these nine powerful habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) Get consistent, quality sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is your brain’s nightly reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you rest, your brain clears out waste, stores memories, and repairs connections that keep your thinking sharp. Skipping rest doesn’t just make you tired. It slows down attention, weakens focus, and makes emotional regulation harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies from the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sleep-deprivation/health-effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; show that even one night of poor sleep affects how your brain processes information. Over time, chronic sleep loss can contribute to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, treat sleep as non-negotiable. Aim for seven to eight hours every night. Keep your room dark, avoid screens before bed, and go to sleep at the same time each evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good sleep is free medicine for your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) Move your body every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise is one of the best things you can do for mental clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you move, your brain receives more oxygen and nutrients. Movement also releases neurochemicals that boost mood, sharpen focus, and help create new brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to train like an athlete. Even &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/things-to-do/k-if-you-commit-to-these-5-weekly-activities-youll-age-better-than-95-of-your-peers/"&gt;moderate activities&lt;/a&gt; like brisk walking, yoga, or cycling help your brain perform better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’ve found that going for a run in the morning clears mental fog faster than coffee. The rhythm of movement resets my thoughts and sets the tone for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise isn’t just about muscles or fitness. It’s brain fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) Feed your brain nutrients it actually needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you eat has a direct impact on how you think and feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research consistently links diet quality with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-024-00226-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;. The Mediterranean diet, for instance, is rich in omega-3s, antioxidants, and plant-based foods that protect brain cells from inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat more foods that support long-term brain health:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens like spinach and kale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Berries for antioxidants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds for healthy fats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole grains for steady energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legumes for protein and fiber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who eats vegan, I’ve seen how clean energy from whole foods keeps my mind focused throughout the day. Processed foods, sugar, and alcohol, on the other hand, can make your brain sluggish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to overhaul your diet overnight. Just make more choices that feed your mind instead of depleting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) Keep learning new things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain loves novelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning strengthens neural pathways and increases plasticity, which helps your mind stay flexible and creative. It doesn’t have to mean going back to school. Try reading new subjects, learning an instrument, or practicing a language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-8-signs-youre-far-more-capable-than-you-give-yourself-credit-for-according-to-psychology/"&gt;you challenge yourself&lt;/a&gt; to learn, your brain forms fresh connections. This process keeps it strong well into older age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve mentioned before that when I started diving into behavioral psychology, it completely changed how I viewed human decision-making. That mental challenge reignited my curiosity and made me realize how important lifelong learning really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you learn something new, your brain literally upgrades itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) Spend time in nature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65565" src="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50.png" alt="" srcset="https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50.png 1600w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-300x158.png 300w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1024x538.png 1024w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-768x403.png 768w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1536x806.png 1536w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-1200x630.png 1200w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-857x450.png 857w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-900x473.png 900w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-420x221.png 420w, https://vegoutmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/es-50-840x441.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain wasn’t designed to stare at screens all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nature helps it recharge. The sounds, colors, and movement of natural environments soothe the nervous system and improve focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that even short &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494425002713#:~:text=A%20consistent%20body%20of%20evidence,et%20al.%2C%202015)." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;exposure to nature&lt;/a&gt; reduces stress hormones and restores attention. Just 20 minutes outdoors can improve cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to grab my camera and head to the nearest park when I need a reset. Observing light, trees, and patterns in nature always brings me back to the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a mountain trail to get the benefits. A walk around your block or sitting under a tree works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) Practice mindfulness or meditation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wandering mind is an anxious mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness trains your brain to stay in the present, reducing stress and increasing clarity. Regular meditation strengthens the prefrontal cortex, which handles focus, decision-making, and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to meditate for hours. Even five to ten minutes of quiet breathing or paying full attention to what you’re doing can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find traditional meditation difficult, try mindful walking, cooking, or simply taking a pause before responding to something stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calm attention is one of the most powerful habits for long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) Nurture real social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human beings are wired for connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong relationships don’t just make you happier; they protect your brain. &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research from Harvard’s&lt;/a&gt; long-term adult development study shows that meaningful social ties are one of the strongest predictors of both happiness and cognitive longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loneliness, on the other hand, has been linked to memory loss and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make time for friends, family, or even small daily interactions with neighbors or coworkers. The conversations you have, the laughter you share, and the empathy you give all stimulate your brain’s social and emotional circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make a point to call a friend or grab coffee with someone at least once a week. It’s not about networking or small talk. It’s about staying human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your brain thrives when it feels connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8) Manage your stress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress is unavoidable, but chronic stress is harmful to your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to cortisol, the body’s stress hormone, can damage neurons in the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/gen-the-art-of-staying-calm-7-habits-of-people-who-never-lose-their-cool/"&gt;Managing stress&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t mean eliminating challenges. It means giving your brain space to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try breathwork, physical activity, time outdoors, or any routine that helps you slow down. I like to end my evenings by putting my phone away, having tea, and reading a few pages of a good book. It tells my brain it’s time to wind down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance is what keeps your brain resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9) Get comfortable with boredom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world full of constant stimulation, boredom has become rare. Yet it’s one of the healthiest states for creativity and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your brain isn’t flooded with information, it activates what neuroscientists call the “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/default-mode-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;default mode network&lt;/a&gt;,” which helps you process experiences and form new insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of your best ideas come when you stop trying to have them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So resist the urge to reach for your phone every time you feel restless. Sit in silence. Let your mind wander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boredom gives your brain space to connect dots you didn’t even know were there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need supplements to protect your brain. You need consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These nine habits might sound simple, but they work because they align with how your brain naturally thrives. Sleep, movement, learning, calmness, and connection — these are what keep your mind strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you care for your brain daily, you’ll notice the difference not just in how well you think, but in how fully you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it one day at a time, and your brain will thank you for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="article-image"&gt;&lt;a href="What-to-know-about-a-rapidly-rising-form-of-breast-cancer-that-s-hard-to-detect-2006662?gallery=1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/195/19572610.295.jpg" alt="File photo of breast cancer awareness" title="File photo of breast cancer awareness"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="image_caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;File photo of breast cancer awareness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Rates of one type of breast cancer — invasive lobular carcinoma — have been rising in the United States more than three times faster than those of all other breast cancers combined over the past decade, according to a new study.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This elusive breast cancer that’s hard to spot in routine mammograms is behind more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The research, published in Cancer, the journal of the American Cancer Society, analyzed national data from 2012 to 2021 and found that rates of invasive lobular carcinoma increased by about 2.8% each year, while rates of all other breast cancer rose by about 0.8% a year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What exactly is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it? How is it diagnosed, and why can it be more difficult to find during screenings? Who is most at risk? What are the treatment options? And what should women know about reducing their risk of developing this and other types of breast cancer?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness medical expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What is invasive lobular carcinoma, and how common is it?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Dr Leana Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Invasive lobular carcinoma, also known as ILC or lobular breast cancer, is a type of breast cancer that begins in the milk-producing glands of the breast, called lobules, and then spreads into nearby tissue. These malignant tumors are often hormone receptor-positive, meaning the cancer cells grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
ILC is the second most common type of breast cancer, after invasive ductal carcinoma, and accounts for 10% to 15% of all new breast cancer diagnoses, according to the National Cancer Institute. About 47,500 ILC cases are diagnosed in the US each year, and more women are diagnosed with it than with brain, kidney, liver, pancreatic or ovarian cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: Why is ILC often more difficult to find with routine mammograms?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: This type of tumor tends to grow in a way that doesn’t change the breast’s structure as much as other cancers. Instead of forming a defined mass, the cancer cells spread through the tissue in thin strands that appear more like normal breast tissue on imaging. Because of this, mammograms may show only subtle changes, or sometimes none at all. Women may also be less likely to feel a distinct lump during a breast self-exam, which can delay detection.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What other imaging is used to diagnose ILC?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: A breast ultrasound can help spot areas of thickened tissue that don’t show up on a mammogram, and a breast MRI provides a more detailed view that can reveal cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These tests aren’t routinely recommended for everyone. Mammography remains the standard screening tool for most women. But those at higher risk, including women with dense breasts and those with a strong family history of breast cancer or known genetic mutations, may be advised to have an ultrasound or MRI in addition to regular mammograms.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What does this study show in terms of the rise of cases and who is most at risk?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Researchers found that ILC has been increasing across every racial and ethnic group, but the steepest rise was seen among Asian American and Pacific Islander women, whose incidence grew by about 4.4% each year in the study period. Age is also a risk factor, as women 65 and older are more likely to be diagnosed with ILC than with invasive ductal carcinoma. About 70% of new ILC cases were diagnosed in women 60 and older; the median age of diagnosis is 66.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: How do the study authors explain the rise especially in this type of breast cancer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Several factors may be driving this greater increase. Because ILC is strongly linked to hormones, changes in hormone exposure over time could be part of the reason. Rising rates of obesity and alcohol use, along with changes in childbearing and menopause patterns, may also contribute to the steady increase.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Improvement in diagnosis and greater awareness of ILC may be leading to more accurate identification. Some lobular cancers may have been misclassified as ductal cancers in the past, so part of the rise may reflect better recognition. In addition, more women are living longer after menopause, which can increase the likelihood of developing ILC compared with other types of breast cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: What are the treatment options for ILC?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Treatment is similar to that for other breast cancers. Surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation, is common, as is hormonal therapy, since most tumors grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Chemotherapy may be used in some cases. For advanced disease, newer targeted drugs combined with hormonal therapy can help slow progression and improve outcomes. However, ILC may have greater resistance to treatment, especially in more advanced disease, and tends to carry a poorer prognosis once it has spread.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;CNN: How can women reduce their risk of developing ILC and other types of breast cancer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wen&lt;/b&gt;: Some risk factors can’t be changed, such as age or family history, but many lifestyle choices can make a difference. Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol, maintaining a healthy weight and staying physically active all help lower the risk of breast cancer. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains supports overall health and may reduce inflammation linked to cancer.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regular screening and knowing what’s normal for your breasts are key for early detection. Talk with your doctor about your risk factors and decide together when you should begin screening and whether you need tests in addition to a mammogram.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Finally, pay attention to changes in your breasts, such as thickening, swelling, nipple discharge, different colors or new areas of fullness, and seek medical evaluation as soon as something looks or feels different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GhanaWeb</author><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 15:37:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxQYldXWlJuZ0J5SlhfSnRIckVvUE5IRU1SbHprQjZoaWJFMXZMeEJ1bmNySlZua3N3V3ZYZW1rN0RIQkVYM3dmbk1zaWNDMXRZMFdLTkpPVTFqdW4zbHR4VWlrRVhLV0VIU29XTWZ2d0dMbWJUUUVpbWktUm51WU5jeUl0dnUtU1c1Ny1GbFFGekRrWWxvaXE3dGVhWEV2b1Z6RDJDUXdRMDh5aTZEQXJsNzdUeThJX3F6dGM2bEFQelFYSHFqOFlPd0RReGNfQjVNR1ZyZg</guid></item><item><title>科学家们刚刚发现了白发与癌症之间令人惊讶的联系-科学日报</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251025084553.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Throughout life, our cells are continually exposed to both internal and external influences that can harm DNA. This DNA damage is a well-known factor in the development of aging and cancer, yet scientists have long struggled to understand the exact link -- especially how DNA-damaged stem cells affect tissue health over time.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) are specialized cells that give rise to melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells responsible for the color of our hair and skin. In mammals, these stem cells are found in a region of the hair follicle known as the bulge-sub-bulge area. Here, they exist as immature melanoblasts, ensuring that hair and skin maintain their color through repeated cycles of regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering How DNA Damage Drives Hair Graying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published online on October 6, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;, a study led by Professor Emi Nishimura and Assistant Professor Yasuaki Mohri at The University of Tokyo explored how McSCs react to different types of DNA damage. Using long-term lineage tracing and gene expression profiling in mice, the researchers discovered that when McSCs experience DNA double-strand breaks, they undergo a process known as senescence-coupled differentiation (seno-differentiation). In this state, the stem cells permanently mature and are eventually lost, which leads to hair turning gray. The process is controlled by the activation of the p53-p21 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When McSCs are exposed to certain carcinogens, including 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene or ultraviolet B radiation, they do not follow the same protective path. Even with DNA damage present, these cells avoid seno-differentiation and continue to renew themselves. They expand clonally instead, aided by KIT ligand signals released from surrounding tissue and the epidermis. These niche-derived signals block the protective differentiation response, pushing the stem cells toward a cancer-prone state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opposing Cellular Fates: Graying or Cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Nishimura, "These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can follow antagonistic fates -- exhaustion or expansion -- depending on the type of stress and microenvironmental signals." She adds, "It reframes hair graying and melanoma not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that their findings do not imply that developing gray hair prevents cancer. Instead, seno-differentiation appears to serve as a stress-triggered defense mechanism that removes damaged stem cells before they can become harmful. When this safeguard fails or is bypassed, those damaged cells can survive and potentially lead to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linking Aging, Cancer, and Cellular Self-Destruction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By uncovering the molecular pathways that determine whether stem cells undergo protective exhaustion or dangerous expansion, this study connects the biology of tissue aging with cancer formation. It also highlights the value of naturally removing compromised stem cells through "senolysis," a biological process that helps prevent cancer by sacrificing cells that could otherwise become malignant.&lt;/p&gt;

The answer lies in interoception, a lesser-known process through which the nervous system constantly monitors the body's internal signals to keep essential functions running.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a collaborative team from Scripps Research and the Allen Institute has received the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director's Transformative Research Award to develop the first comprehensive atlas of this internal sensory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Major Investment in Brain-Body Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading the project is Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist Ardem Patapoutian, joined by Li Ye, the N. Paul Whittier Chair in Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Scripps Research, and Bosiljka Tasic, Director of Molecular Genetics at the Allen Institute. Xin Jin, Associate Professor at Scripps Research, will serve as co-investigator, directing the genomic and cell-type identification work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH has awarded the team $14.2 million over five years to carry out this ambitious project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My team is honored that the NIH is supporting the kind of collaborative science needed to study such a complex system," says Patapoutian, the Presidential Endowed Chair in Neurobiology at Scripps Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patapoutian, who shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of cellular sensors that detect touch, will now apply his expertise to understanding interoception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope our results will help other scientists ask new questions about how internal organs and the nervous system stay in sync," adds Ye. Like Patapoutian, he's also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Established in 2009, the Transformative Research Award funds groundbreaking interdisciplinary projects that push beyond traditional scientific boundaries. It is part of the NIH Common Fund's High-Risk, High-Reward Research Program, designed to support innovative ideas that could reshape our understanding of human health but might otherwise struggle to receive funding through conventional mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes Interoception Unique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the classic senses -- such as smell, sight, and hearing -- which rely on specialized sensory organs that detect stimuli from the outside world, interoception involves a vast network of neurons that sense what's happening inside the body. These neural circuits track critical processes including circulation, digestion, and immune activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because interoceptive signals originate deep within the body and are often processed unconsciously, scientists often describe this system as our "hidden sixth sense."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its fundamental role, interoception has received little scientific attention. The signals it produces are complex, overlapping, and difficult to measure. The sensory neurons that carry them are distributed throughout organs such as the heart, lungs, stomach, and kidneys, making them hard to isolate and map precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the Brain-Body Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the NIH's support, the Scripps and Allen Institute researchers plan to map how sensory neurons connect with a wide variety of internal organs, including the heart and gastrointestinal tract. Their goal is to create a detailed anatomical and molecular atlas that reveals how these neural pathways are organized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, one part of the project will label sensory neurons and use whole-body imaging to trace their routes from the spinal cord to different organs, producing a high-resolution 3D map. The second part will use genetic profiling to distinguish between different cell types, such as neurons that send signals from the gut, bladder, or fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these datasets will form the first standardized reference for understanding the body's internal sensory wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Interoception Matters for Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By decoding how interoception works, scientists hope to uncover key principles of brain-body communication that could lead to new treatments for disease. Disruptions in these internal sensory pathways have been linked to a range of conditions, including autoimmune disorders, chronic pain, neurodegenerative diseases, and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Interoception is fundamental to nearly every aspect of health, but it remains a largely unexplored frontier of neuroscience," says Jin, who's a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Freeman Hrabowski Scholar. "By creating the first atlas of this system, we aim to lay the foundation for better understanding how the brain keeps the body in balance, how that balance can be disrupted in disease and how we might restore it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The glasses — a prototype which Palanker admits is a “little awkward-looking” —  have an attached camera that captures images and then projects them, via infrared light, to the chip. Meanwhile, the 2-by-2-millimeter chip — implanted into the patients’ damaged retinas — converts those images into electrical stimulation, restoring sight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0 ruduv2y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to a household key, the chip pales in size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science Corporation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 32 participants who completed the clinical trial — all older than 60 and with sight worse than &lt;a href="https://www.nvisioncenters.com/improve-eyesight/20-100-vision-and-up/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;20/320&lt;/a&gt; in at least one eye. Once they had the new technology, some could make out patterns immediately, while it took others months of training before their sight improved. A year after receiving the device, the vast majority — 27 people — had regained the ability to read, though they could only see a few letters at a time. With their artificial retinas, some could read with 20/42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen trial participants experienced side effects, such as pressure, tears and bleeding — though most of these issues resolved within two months.

		&lt;p&gt;Grey mornings steal the colour from the sky, coats get heavier, and energy seems to drain faster than the daylight. Colds circle like gossip, nails snap, moods dip, and sleep feels less restorative than it should. There’s a quiet culprit behind so many November slumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus heater fogs the windows as a woman in a wool scarf taps her Oyster card and stares at the faint sun, a pale coin behind the cloud. In the office, she eats porridge by a screen that glows brighter than the day outside, then walks home under street lamps that flicker before five. Small aches, a steady tiredness, a sense that coffee does less than it used to. The clocks didn’t just shift time; they shifted her body’s chemistry, one missing light signal at a time. It’s the sunshine you can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The invisible gap November brings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Call it what it is: **vitamin D** is the thing many women are running short on in November. The sun sits low and the angle means UVB barely reaches you at all in the UK. Winter coats cover skin, commutes happen in the dark, and lunch breaks are swallowed by rain. Your bones, muscles, immune cells and even mood circuitry use this nutrient like a language. When it fades, life feels heavier than it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Priya, 34, who works in an NHS scheduling office in Lewisham. By mid-November she was skipping her evening Pilates because her legs felt leaden and her motivation fell off a cliff. Her GP, familiar with that seasonal pattern, suggested a blood test and a simple daily supplement. She felt steadier by January. In the background, the UK’s own data echoes her story: roughly one in five people have low vitamin D levels in winter and spring, with higher risk if you have darker skin or keep most of your skin covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a clean logic to it. The north-of-50-degrees latitude means the sun’s UVB is too weak from roughly October to March for most people to make vitamin D in skin. Food helps, but not much: oily fish, egg yolks and fortified milks offer only small amounts, and vegetarian choices are slimmer still. Melanin reduces vitamin D synthesis, city living limits daylight, and desk jobs do the rest. The body tries to coast on summer stores, then—bang—November arrives and the tank runs low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="The #1 Vitamin Every Woman Needs for Hormonal Balance (Backed by Science!)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQWQRotp2ss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to top up without turning your life upside down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest play is boring, which is why it works: take **10 micrograms (400 IU)** of vitamin D daily through autumn and winter. That’s the UK guidance for adults, including women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Put the bottle next to the kettle or toothbrush and swallow it with your main meal, as fat helps absorption. If you prefer plant-based, look for D3 from lichen; it’s vegan and widely available. Tiny habit, big return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest: nobody really does that every day. The trick is to lower the friction. Buy a three-month supply in one go. Set a phone reminder for the time you naturally pause, like after lunch. If you regularly forget, a weekly dose can be discussed with your GP or pharmacist. Don’t chase mega-doses on your own, and don’t exceed the UK’s safe upper limit of 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) a day. If you have kidney issues, take certain medications, or have a health condition affecting calcium, ask your clinician for personalised advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food still counts, but think of it as a nudge, not the fix. A tin of sardines on toast, mushrooms exposed to UV light, fortified yoghurt or plant milks slipped into porridge. Your plate can support what the sky won’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“November is when vitamin D goes quiet in Britain,” says a London-based dietitian. “A small, consistent supplement bridges that silence for bone, immune and mood support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick D3 where you can; vegan D3 exists and works well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor the tablet to a daily cue: kettle, keys, or toothbrush.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat oily fish once or twice a week if you enjoy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for “fortified with vitamin D” on milks and cereals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you cover most skin or have darker skin, speak to your GP about year-round needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What this means for your November&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all had that moment when the early dark feels like it’s winning. The good news is you can change the odds with a habit so small it barely dents your day. Think of vitamin D as a winter foundation—quiet, unflashy, stabilising—so your energy, focus, and sense of steadiness don’t rely on rare blue skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It won’t fix everything. It can shift the background, the slow hum your body runs on as you stack work, family, and the life you’d still like to live when the sun clocks off at four. If you share a house, make it a household ritual, like tapping the lights off at night or topping the fruit bowl. One tiny pill, the same time, each day. In the gloom of November, that kind of predictability feels like a small act of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FAQ :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get enough vitamin D from the sun in November in the UK?&lt;/strong&gt;Not realistically. The sun’s UVB angle is too low for most of the UK, even at midday. Short outdoor time is still great for mood and movement, but it won’t cover vitamin D.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I choose D2 or D3?&lt;/strong&gt;D3 tends to raise and maintain blood levels more effectively. Vegan D3 from lichen is widely available if you avoid animal products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the safest dose to take daily?&lt;/strong&gt;For most adults, **10 micrograms (400 IU)** daily through autumn and winter is advised in the UK. Don’t exceed 100 micrograms (4,000 IU) a day unless your clinician recommends it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How soon might I feel a difference?&lt;/strong&gt;Some people notice steadier energy within a few weeks, while others simply avoid the slow slide they felt in past winters. The body is topping up a low reservoir, which takes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I’m pregnant, breastfeeding, or have a health condition?&lt;/strong&gt;Stick with 10 micrograms daily unless your midwife or doctor advises otherwise. If you have kidney problems, sarcoidosis, high calcium, or take certain medicines, get personalised guidance first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The "gut microbiome" has become a popular health term in recent years. It's easy to see why, with an abundance of research showing how important the trillions of microbes living in our gut are for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what many people might not realize is that the microbiome doesn't only contain bacteria. It also contains other types of microbes – including fungi. The fungal component of the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/gut-microbiome-1624"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is called the "mycobiome".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the mycobiome has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.572538"&gt;less well studied&lt;/a&gt; than its bacterial counterpart, recent research shows it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56743-8"&gt;sensitive to diet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(22)00203-8"&gt;may affect our health&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-contain-a-variety-of-microbiomes-heres-a-look-at-a-few-of-the-most-important"&gt;We Contain a Variety of Microbiomes. Here's a Look at a Few of The Most Important.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178405" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178405" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CandidaFungiSEM.jpg" alt="single-celled fungus that is commonly found on the skin and the mucous membranes of the mouth, digestive and respiratory tracts, and the vagina, where it is usually harmless" class="size-full wp-image-178405" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CandidaFungiSEM.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CandidaFungiSEM-600x351.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178405" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; is infamous for causing thrush when the bacteria that usually keeps it in check is out of balance. (Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best studied mycobiome is the one in our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.04.043"&gt;intestines&lt;/a&gt;. It's composed of many fungal species. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2024.2399360"&gt;most common fungal species&lt;/a&gt; found there, particularly in the Western world, belong to the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560624/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; family&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; are a type of yeast. For most of us, the &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; population in our mycobiome is kept in check by our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26053625/"&gt;immune system and our gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. But changes to either of these can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2016.1247140"&gt;populations of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to expand in the mycobiome. This can be a problem, because &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; may cause &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-022-00826-w"&gt;life-threatening infections&lt;/a&gt; in people with damaged immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, research found that hospital patients who are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000000746"&gt;given antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to develop &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is partly explained by the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.015"&gt;effect of antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which kill off certain species of gut bacteria that compete with &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; for space and resources within the intestine. Antibiotics have also been found to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2022.04.013"&gt;directly alter our immune cells&lt;/a&gt; and how they fight fungal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study, which analyzed the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-019-0709-7"&gt;mycobiome of cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;, found that those who developed serious &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; infections had an overgrowth of the fungus in their mycobiome just before the infection started. Combined with the damaging effects of chemotherapy on the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-023-02781-2"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, this made it harder for patients to fight off the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruption in the mycobiome's &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; balance has also been linked to several other diseases. For instance, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01361-14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; levels are high&lt;/a&gt; in patients who are critically ill. This suggests that too much Candida in our guts is a sign of poor health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the fungal mycobiome have also been linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/17562848211047130"&gt;several gut diseases&lt;/a&gt;, including inflammatory bowel disease. Research on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04502-w"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; has also shown that patients have an overgrowth of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;. These fungi also produce toxins that irritate the gut lining, which could potentially explain some of the symptoms Crohn's patients experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; in the gut can activate immune cells as well, making them more inflammatory. This has been seen in patients with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-023-01637-4"&gt;severe COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mycobiomes in the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mycobiome isn't only found in our gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also have a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2016.1249093"&gt;skin mycobiome&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the skin &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature12171"&gt;between our toes&lt;/a&gt; contains a more diverse number of fungal species than any other skin mycobiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37703811/"&gt;skin mycobiome&lt;/a&gt; is mostly dominated by a fungus called &lt;em&gt;Malassezia&lt;/em&gt;. This yeast has adapted to grow on the skin's surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Malassezia&lt;/em&gt; can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2016.1249093"&gt;activate the immune cells&lt;/a&gt; that reside between the skin's layers. This may lead to inflammation linked to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2008.07.058"&gt;skin disorders&lt;/a&gt;, such as psoriasis and eczema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178397" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/IllustrationOfPsoriasisExcessiveSkinCellGrowthFormingPlaques.jpg" alt="illustration of excessive skin cell growth in psoriasis forming plaques" class="wp-image-178397 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/IllustrationOfPsoriasisExcessiveSkinCellGrowthFormingPlaques.jpg 727w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/IllustrationOfPsoriasisExcessiveSkinCellGrowthFormingPlaques-642x424.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/IllustrationOfPsoriasisExcessiveSkinCellGrowthFormingPlaques-600x396.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178397" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Psoriasis is a skin condition where excessive growth of skin cells can lead to itchy, scaly, thickened patches (plaques) of skin which may become infected. (Nemes Laszlo/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt; is also a cause for concern. This fungus is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(23)00114-3"&gt;resistant to many antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt;, which is why it can be a problem if it grows on the skin's surface. In a hospital or emergency room, this could be dangerous – particularly to patients who have immune system problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also have a mycobiome within the vagina. Its balance with the bacterial communities living there can be a big determinant for vaginal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(18)30103-8"&gt;most common fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; globally is vaginal candidiasis (thrush). It can &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/common-symptoms/thrush"&gt;cause symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as intense itching, pain and swelling. Many adult women will experience at least one thrush infection in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of thrush is another fungus from the Candida family: &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt;. This is a common member of the vaginal mycobiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1002611107"&gt;vagina's microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is normally dominated by the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/em&gt; which help keep &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; populations in check. But if the balance between bacteria and fungi gets disrupted (for example, by antibiotics), the fungus can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12934-020-01464-4"&gt;overgrow or produce inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt; within the vagina. This inflammatory response is responsible for common thrush symptoms such as redness and itching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotics may help to restore the balance between fungi and bacteria to prevent vaginal yeast infections – although this has had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuaf013"&gt;limited success so far&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adi3363"&gt;new treatments&lt;/a&gt; that target inflammation-causing fungal molecules have shown promise in animal models and in small numbers of women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's good evidence to suggest we might also have a mycobiome in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s2213-2600(18)30510-1"&gt;lungs&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2019.03.008"&gt;breastmilk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controversially, some have even suggested that we may have small numbers of fungal cells in the brain – and these fungal cells may be linked with neurodegenerative disorders such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.42257"&gt;Parkinsons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/srep15015"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00159"&gt;Autopsy studies&lt;/a&gt; have found evidence of fungi in the brains of people who died from brain disorders – but this doesn't prove the fungi caused their illness or that it was there during their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdf/S2211-1247(23)01252-4.pdf"&gt;Experimental studies in mice&lt;/a&gt; have also shown that small numbers of fungal cells can survive in the brain for long periods of time – and the presence of these fungal cells was linked with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-07991-4"&gt;reduced memory function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003020"&gt;Experiments in flies&lt;/a&gt; have also shown fungi may travel to the brain and affect function. This is the best evidence we currently have showing small numbers of fungi may get into the brain and survive long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this occurs in people, and if this would be considered a true mycobiome, remains to be proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still much we don't know about the mycobiome. But with continued research in this area we may soon better understand the mycobiome's importance in our health and how we can nurture and care for it.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264545/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multinational team of researchers has discovered that over 20% of adults with a normal BMI range experience levels of abdominal obesity that puts them at higher risk of hypertension, diabetes, high total cholesterol, and elevated triglycerides.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Cardiometabolic disorders rank among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Over the past three decades, cardiovascular disease cases rose from 271 million to 523 million, with disability-adjusted life-years nearly doubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdominal obesity, especially &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/visceral+fat/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;, disrupts &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+processes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic processes&lt;/a&gt; via inflammatory pathways that contribute to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/insulin+resistance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, dyslipidemia, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and impaired glucose regulation. Diabetes affected an estimated 828 million adults in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMI often fails to capture actual fat distribution, and studies have reported greater cardiovascular risk and mortality among individuals with normal BMI but higher waist circumference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Cardiometabolic Outcomes Among Adults With Abdominal Obesity and Normal Body Mass Index," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840296" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers used a cross-sectional design to investigate the global prevalence of normal-weight &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/abdominal+obesity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;abdominal obesity&lt;/a&gt; and its association with cardiometabolic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Data came from the World Health Organization Stepwise Approach to Surveillance of Noncommunicable Disease Risk Factors (WHO STEPS) surveys in 91 countries between 2000 and 2020, including 471,228 participants aged 15 to 69 years across Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdominal obesity was defined as high waist circumference (≥80 cm in women; ≥94 cm in men). Normal-weight abdominal obesity combines normal BMI (18.5–24.9) with high waist circumference. The main outcomes were hypertension, diabetes, high total cholesterol, and high triglycerides. Measurements were via standardized interviews, physical body measures, and biochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the global dataset, abdominal obesity was associated with several behavioral and metabolic factors. Individuals with larger waist circumferences were more likely to report low fruit and vegetable intake (odds ratio [OR] 1.22) and physical inactivity (OR 1.60). Clinically, those with abdominal obesity but a normal body mass index showed higher odds of hypertension (OR 1.29), diabetes (OR 1.81), high total cholesterol (OR 1.39), and high triglycerides (OR 1.56).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, higher education trended toward higher odds of the presence of abdominal obesity, with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/primary+education/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;primary education&lt;/a&gt; (OR 1.53) and secondary or higher education (OR 2.38) raising the risk compared with no formal schooling. Africa was the lone exception with secondary and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/higher+education/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;higher education&lt;/a&gt; associated with lower odds (OR 0.64).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Across the pooled sample, 21.7% of participants with normal BMI had abdominal obesity, ranging from 15.3% in the Western Pacific region to 32.6% in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Lebanon showed the highest country-level prevalence at 58.4%, and Mozambique the lowest at 6.9%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with a normal BMI but enlarged waist circumference faced higher odds of adverse metabolic conditions compared with peers of normal BMI without abdominal obesity. Hypertension, diabetes, high total cholesterol (OR 1.39), and high triglycerides showed globally significant increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few regional exceptions were discovered as high total cholesterol was not observed in the Americas, high triglycerides were not found in Europe and hypertension did not rise in the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that relying solely on BMI may be insufficient to identify high-risk individuals with normal-weight abdominal obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

It persists not for lack of science or solutions, but because leaders have failed to act with the urgency and commitment the crisis demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A consortium of more than 50 partners, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), is responding to these outbreaks through the &lt;a href="https://www.gtfcc.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Global Task Force on Cholera Control&lt;/a&gt;– a partnership established in 1992 to enable access to essential supplies, as well as work on the detection, prevention and treatment of cholera and set global priorities to sustainably control the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Complementing the work of the taskforce, in August the WHO and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; Centres for Disease Control and Prevention launched a continental cholera emergency response plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8b6c02be-b19e-4970-9fc8-43b3873fb026" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Sudan cholera outbreak kills 40 in a week as health centres overwhelmed","elementId":"8b6c02be-b19e-4970-9fc8-43b3873fb026","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/aug/14/sudan-cholera-outbreak-water-health-medecins-sans-frontieres-msf-war-refugees"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":8,"display":0,"theme":1}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cholera is caused by a bacterium ingested in food or water contaminated with faeces from an infected person, and the only way to prevent it is by ensuring access to safe water and sanitation. This is why it is now practically unheard of in countries with those facilities, but thrives in communities afflicted by inequality, poverty, conflict, displacement and climate-related disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The disease can be prevented with effective vaccines. An injectable vaccine was first developed in the late 19th century, and was superseded by oral vaccines in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But because the disease afflicts almost exclusively the poorest countries and communities, the vaccine does not attract investment from developers, for whom it offers little market opportunity. There is currently only one manufacturer producing cholera vaccines at the scale needed for mass vaccination campaigns: EUBiologics, based in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To manage cholera outbreaks, the WHO and other partners established a global &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/groups/icg/cholera/stockpiles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cholera vaccine stockpile&lt;/a&gt; for outbreaks in 2013 under the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision (ICG) to ensure rapid, equitable and effective access to vaccines in emergencies, especially in low-resource settings. Since then, the stockpile has distributed almost 255m doses of vaccine to 34 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Almost 75% of those doses have been distributed since 2021, in response to the global resurgence of cholera. So far this year, the stockpile has disbursed more than 49m vaccine doses – already eclipsing the previous record for a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Given the increasing frequency and severity of outbreaks, vaccines from the stockpile can only be used to bring outbreaks under control, rather than to conduct preventive campaigns in areas at risk of cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The stockpile is replenished every week but production cannot keep up with demand, and it is regularly below the &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-global-emergency-vaccine-stockpiles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommended threshold&lt;/a&gt; of having 5m doses ready to respond to outbreaks at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To stretch supplies further, the ICG suspended the standard two-dose vaccination regimen in 2022 in favour of a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-14" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Global Dispatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"global-dispatch","successDescription":"Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Single-dose vaccination is only therefore a temporary solution to scarce supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Demand shows no sign of abating, meaning supply must increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In October 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/zambia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Zambia&lt;/a&gt; signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s Jijia Medical Technology Company to establish a cholera vaccine-production facility in Lusaka. The planned production will still require rigorous quality assurance and clinical trials to confirm safety and efficacy before any locally manufactured doses can be approved by the WHO and deployed in mass vaccination campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While expanding vaccine production in Africa is essential for preventing and responding to outbreaks of this historical disease, the only long-term solution is for governments to invest in safe drinking water and sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There are some diseases that cannot be completely prevented, such as Alzheimer’s and most cancers. But cholera is not one of them – it can be stopped. Cholera persists because poverty, inequality, conflict and displacement persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stopping it is therefore not a scientific, medical or technical challenge; fundamentally, it’s a political one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 13:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxQNDZVMmVrdS1LWkNudG1oSkZNTTFibjBjcUM1VlYtbVloOTN0RU5iR242QzRyTi04ZHA0aHByYjNWWEhQT1pELTZBOS16QUNiZHRVbENBZ2JlQXRQeHdjb1dZM0Y3RXZBNDRHdkdMSExUSkEwV0FCQ1NSenR5NjUyNVJvZEpNb2oyN0VLeVlvSHhPMFRLZE11clRySnhtN1V4ZWdELVBDWU9nbElVaG5QZnMtRQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
