      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I'm a lab scientist. Had a guy come in at the end of the day for chest pain that’s been bothering him 'all weekend.' The emergency doc ordered a troponin blood test, which helps rule in/out heart attacks. If the test runs above 0.03, we consider that a sign for a heart attack and act accordingly. This guy’s very first troponin was 21.00. TWENTY-ONE. The highest we’ve ever had up till then was an 8.00. The guy should’ve been dead ages ago, but he somehow pulled through. Don’t ignore chest pains, people."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Also, just wanna clarify that the hospital I work for is a tiny-ass, 25-bed, rural-community critical care hospital. Definitely not a place with dedicated cardiologists, cath lab, bedside assays, or even a big test menu, period. Bare basics! And the guy did, somehow, end up surviving."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;–&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LimeGap/" target="_blank"&gt;LimeGap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2, the cause of covid-19, isn’t the only coronavirus in the world we should be keeping our eye on. Scientists appear to have just discovered a new branch of coronaviruses in Brazilian bats that could have the tools needed to spill over and infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large team of researchers in Japan and Brazil identified the possible zoonotic threat in a preliminary study released last week. The viral relative appears to be genetically distinct from other coronaviruses yet shares a feature with SARS-CoV-2 that may allow its kind to infect human cells. The findings suggest there are plenty of native bat coronaviruses in the wild with the potential to cause new epidemics in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The high diversity of viruses in bats therefore positions them as a key taxonomic group for zoonotic disease surveillance,” the authors &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684489v1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, presented as a preprint on the website bioRxiv.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A key similarity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even prior to the emergence of covid-19 more than five years ago, scientists had been worried about &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/were-not-ready-for-the-next-pandemic-1839169413"&gt;coronaviruses&lt;/a&gt; causing the next big pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, its earlier ancestor SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are coronaviruses that successfully became human pathogens over the past two decades; all three belong to the betacoronavirus genus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the study researchers, however, almost everything we know about the diversity of this genus is based on data collected from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, with little genetic sequencing of such viruses in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To help remedy this gap in knowledge, the team analyzed gut tissue samples collected from 70 bats in three sites across Brazil between May and August 2019. They found the new virus in a Parnell’s mustached bat (&lt;em&gt;Pteronotus parnellii&lt;/em&gt;) and completely sequenced its genome.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Based on their analysis, the virus—which they coined BRZ batCoV—is different enough genetically to represent a previously unknown subgenus of betacoronavirus. Until now, five subgenera had been identified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the virus also appears to have something important in common with SARS-CoV-2: a functional furin cleavage site (FCS) at the S1/S2 junction of its spike protein. In fact, the FCS in BRZ batCoV is only different by a single amino acid compared to the one in SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;How worried should we be?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FCS in SARS-CoV-2 is one of the features that helps it to infect humans. So finding something very similar in this new virus is certainly troubling. The researchers also note that other bat betacoronaviruses are known to have an FCS in the same location, suggesting it’s relatively easy for this feature to pop up in these viruses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another concerning aspect is that since there’s so little surveillance of Brazil and other areas in the Americas, it’s more than possible that BRZ batCoV and similar viruses have been circulating under our noses for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The new research hasn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, a vital part of vetting any new study. The researchers also point out that they haven’t directly examined the infectivity of BRZ batCoV, a caveat that limits how much we can know about its risk to humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hence, although the presence of an FCS is clearly significant, any discussion of the zoonotic potential of this virus should be limited,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, this sort of research should be seen as an early warning signal. While the origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being debated—even if &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/virologists-and-epidemiologists-back-natural-origin-covid-19-survey-suggests"&gt;most virologists&lt;/a&gt; are in the natural camp—many human diseases do first start off as zoonotic germs that successfully jump from animals to people (case in point, the&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1472041/#:~:text=Additional%20SARS%20cases%20resulted%20from,virus%20to%20humans%20(60)."&gt; original SARS&lt;/a&gt;). Bats and the viruses they carry are a prime suspect for causing the next big pandemic, and it’s urgent that we better track what’s out there, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our study provides a broader understanding of the phylogenetic and functional diversity of bat coronaviruses as well as their zoonotic potential,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="custom-html embed-container mv-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle isn’t the only city that’s faced difficult neighborhood conversations when deciding where to locate services aimed at helping people in mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan King County Council &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/mental-health/king-county-council-approves-plans-funding-for-capitol-hill-crisis-center/" class="content-link"&gt;voted last month to place a walk-in mental health crisis center on Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; — a location that sparked discussions in the surrounding neighborhood and heated public comments at council meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the center say the facility is needed in the neighborhood, which struggles with disorder tied to homelessness, drug use and mental health. But some local residents, business owners and real estate owners voiced concern about how the center might affect public safety in the surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://dchsblog.com/2025/10/01/listening-to-local-voices-community-engagement-for-the-seattle-crisis-care-center-location/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;King County says it has held nearly 60&lt;/a&gt; community conversations, presentations, walking tours and other events focused on the Capitol Hill location, some in the neighborhood say the county hasn’t sufficiently engaged with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. cities have also navigated community relationships and dealt with pushback as they seek to build centers adjacent to residential areas and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can Seattle learn from other cities’ experience? Similar centers in Denver and Milwaukee can provide lessons on managing relationships and operating a center successfully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-19008117-1353473057" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":19008117,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=300x226 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1024x772 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=768x579 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1536x1158 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=2048x1544 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=780x588 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1020x769 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1560x1176 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=2040x1538 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=375x283 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=780x588","caption":"King County plans to site a new mental health crisis center on Capitol Hill, at a former Polyclinic building located at 1145 Broadway.

Almost half of residents are below the poverty line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Valley has a lot of publicly subsidized affordable housing, and a lot of families, said Jeanne Granville, president of the Sun Valley Community Coalition. Census data shows that more than half the population is under the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city’s vision for the center had a lot in common with &lt;a href="https://www.desc.org/what-we-do/crisis-response/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;DESC’s Crisis Solutions Center&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle — it would accept people via referrals from law enforcement and other first responders. People could access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city contracted with WellPower, a large mental health provider in Colorado, to operate the center. WellPower also partners with the Denver Police Department to send mental health professionals to calls alongside police. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were not necessarily the program that the neighborhood wanted,” said Ellen Todd, WellPower’s associate director for crisis services. “They wanted a youth program coming in, and this was not it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-19008046-2031076544" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":19008046,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=300x200 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1024x683 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=768x512 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1536x1024 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=2048x1365 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=780x520 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1020x680 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1560x1040 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=2040x1360 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=375x250 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=780x520","caption":"Inside the Behavioral Health Solutions Center in Denver, patients can access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit.

(Brad Nicol / WellPower)","width":2400,"height":1600}],"context":"gallery","featured":"false"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community members were concerned the center would be a “revolving door, not really a solution,” Granville said, and that people struggling with mental health conditions would wander the neighborhood alongside children going to or from school. They didn’t really understand how the center would be structured or what it would do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a better understanding of who it was going to be, how it was going to serve folks, how it was going to operate was really important,” Granville said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the center opened, the community coalition and the provider worked with a mediator from the city to draft a &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/1/public-health-and-environment/documents/cbh/solutioncenter_goodneighboragreement.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Good Neighbor Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It outlined requirements WellPower (formerly named the Mental Health Center of Denver) and the city of Denver must follow, including 24/7 security staffing, the creation of a neighborhood advisory committee, and regular reporting on the center’s use. It also banned the center from admitting registered sex offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King County will require every center’s operator to create a good neighbor agreement with the surrounding community. For Capitol Hill, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell &lt;a href="https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/08/COS-CCC-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;has also asked the county&lt;/a&gt; to partner with Seattle police on a security assessment and plan for ongoing safe operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good neighbor agreements are really a useful tool to sit down and walk through those concerns and be proactive,” Granville said. “If there are things that come up, how will they be addressed quickly?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wellpower.org/behavioral-health-solutions-center/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;The Behavioral Health Solutions Center opened in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and has had “very little effect” on the neighborhood, Granville said. Initially, WellPower held monthly meetings the neighborhood could attend; now they’re just quarterly “because things have been going so well,” Todd said. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;There’s a key difference from the center planned in Capitol Hill: Patients can’t walk in on their own. WellPower operates a walk-in crisis center in another part of the city, which served about 2,300 people in 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granville thinks a walk-in center would have been a “very different situation” that the Sun Valley community wouldn’t have been receptive to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the solutions center served 777 people. WellPower creates a discharge plan for every patient and offers Lyft rides or bus tickets to the next location they’re going to, Todd said. If they need shelter, they can stay in adjacent temporary housing for up to 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient transportation and discharge planning have also been questions in King County. The county has said money is designated for postdischarge stabilization, which will include staff to take patients to follow-up appointments and transportation to get them to their home, a shelter or another treatment facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granville said the Sun Valley neighborhood’s safety concerns haven’t come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already know that there are people who are experiencing behavioral health and substance use crises in your neighborhood,” Todd said. “We are here to help them and to provide those services. Without us, people are walking around and they’re still experiencing a behavioral health or substance use crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Credible messengers&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A unique requirement of Wisconsin’s involuntary treatment system led to a new emergency mental health center in Milwaukee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has a law that applies to large counties: People brought in on an involuntary mental health hold (which in Wisconsin, can only be initiated by police) must be assessed by a physician within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a mental health-specific emergency center plays a key role in streamlining the system, said Michael Lappen, Milwaukee County’s behavioral health administrator. It allows law enforcement to bring patients to a facility that’s specifically designed to evaluate and treat them, without putting that burden on generalized hospital emergency rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milwaukee County had for decades run a crisis emergency department as part of a larger mental health complex in Wauwatosa, a suburb west of the city. In 2018, it decided to outsource inpatient psychiatric care to Universal Health Services — but the private company declined to take responsibility for the emergency department, &lt;a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/solutions/2019/08/16/milwaukee-county-could-lose-its-psychiatric-crisis-center/1819222001/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the old mental health complex moved toward closure, the county had to figure out how to open a designated emergency center — “the thing that makes the system work here,” Lappen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parcel was available next to the county’s human services building in the King Park neighborhood. The neighborhood is mostly residential and has some low income housing; it’s close to downtown, but separated by Interstate 43. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available property was also in the center of the need for mental health care. Data showed that 70% of people admitted to the county’s mental health crisis center were from the 53205 ZIP code (where the property is located) or one of nine adjacent ZIP codes, Lappen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Lanier, a pastor in Milwaukee, was part of the county’s Mental Health Board and had previously launched a &lt;a href="https://wjlanier.com/miracle-mental-health-2/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;mental health ministry&lt;/a&gt; working to decrease stigma in the city’s Black community. He helped the county spread the word about the center with the community through listening sessions and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It increased their credibility and relationship with the community because we were credible messengers,” Lanier said. “That strong relationship with our network bore a lot of relational fruit. It’s extra significant in a city like Milwaukee that’s known for being highly segregated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Lappen and Lanier said there wasn’t much pushback from the neighborhood community where the center was planned. Lanier appreciated the county’s intentionality in engaging during the planning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes that community engagement is thought of as an afterthought or an appendage to a process that’s already foregone,” Lanier said. “Because of our relationships and advocacy, that allowed for a richer process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://mentalhealthmke.org/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Mental Health Emergency Center&lt;/a&gt; opened in September 2022 and has averaged about 8,000 visits per year. Adults and youth can access medication and short-term care to help them stabilize; the average adult stay is seven hours, Lappen said. If patients need more intensive treatment, the center will help transfer them to inpatient care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of patients come in voluntarily and half are brought in on involuntary treatment holds. The county pays half of the operating costs and the rest is split among local hospital systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being adjacent to downtown is helpful, Lappen said, because people are able to access other services to get meals or shelters. There’s a large hospital two blocks away, where patients can be transferred if they need more intensive medical care. It’s also much faster for law enforcement and other first responders to bring patients in for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We went from being where nobody was to where 70% of the patients actually live,” Lappen said. “That’s why it’s working out so well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They haven’t seen increased crime or negative outcomes around the center, Lappen said. The effects have actually been positive: Fewer people living outside in the neighborhood, fewer people in crisis, less crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, Lanier said, the community has said the facility should be bigger so it could serve more people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For us, this is the bridge to get to service, and it makes the community better and healthier,” Lappen said. “If your community embraces that getting help actually shouldn’t be stigmatized, it should be celebrated, then you’ll see a culture where that’s accepted.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was, as my sports medicine doctor counseled, “time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since I was a teen, it had been my primary form of exercise and stress relief. But for months, I had been ignoring small signs of encroaching decrepitude: the popping and grinding in my right knee and hip joints whenever I stood up, bent down or took the stairs. The medical term for this is crepitus, yet I kept stubbornly persuading myself that I was still a “young” fiftysomething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I had imbibed the common positive ageing message: “50 is the new 30.” Yet as far as the cells that make up my knee and hip tendons and cartilage are concerned, 50 is still very much 50. So much for the popular idea that our overall “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/well/live/biological-age-testing.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;” can be far younger than our chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, I had done everything experts recommend – eat well, sleep well, exercise – and yet my doctor was still telling me it was time to adapt to my changing body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My physiatrist told me that many of his gen X patients, now in their late 40s and 50s, have bought into the idea that age shouldn’t be a factor when it comes to what exercise they do or how they do it. Each trendy sport or exercise sends a new wave of us into his office and others like it. For instance, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31796221/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly 91% of people showing up to the emergency room with injuries related to playing pickleball were over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many people approach their physical fitness as if they were a decade or two younger. My GP told me that patients over 50 are often frustrated by any suggestion that their routines might have to change. I started to see this denial of physical realities everywhere. One of my colleagues injured her shoulder doing CrossFit, then re-injured herself a few months later doing the same routine. A friend who has practiced yoga for decades fractured her chin in a fall from crow pose. When I suggested she modify her routine, she scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2df18a7b-fa8b-4fdd-b834-51d3c9492827" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How do I stay healthy in my 50s, 60s and 70s?","elementId":"2df18a7b-fa8b-4fdd-b834-51d3c9492827","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jul/23/how-stay-healthy-50s-60s-70s-ageing-tips-advice"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a medical anthropologist, I wondered: had anti-ageing messaging accidentally created a new problem? Was our generation at risk not from under-exercising, like the boomer and silent generations before us, but from over-exercising?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-our-bodies-change-as-we-age" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How our bodies change as we age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Emily Finkelstein, a geriatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine, loves that people in their 40s, 50s and 60s have internalized that exercise is important for healthy ageing and longevity. That being said, there are some practical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our muscle mass and our performance peak in our mid-30s,” Finkelstein said, “and start to naturally decline after that. We do need to be flexible in terms of what we’re doing and expecting of ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As we edge past 45, we begin to lose critical muscle mass, which can decrease our strength and balance. Decreases in bone density can leave us more vulnerable to stress fractures from repetitive motions and stress. The cartilage in our joints thin, while tendons and ligaments stiffen. All of this means we’re more prone to injuries during physical activity. Recovery takes longer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The thing that people don’t know and don’t learn,” Dr Rosanne Leipzig said, “is that ageing begins at birth, and your abilities are definitely going to change.” Leipzig knows quite a lot about this process, both as a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and as someone in her 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You reach a maximum for your muscle mass, bone strength, ability to remember a list of words, all in your 30s. And everything starts to decline after that,” she said. “Ageing doesn’t mean that you can’t do what you did previously, but you probably can’t do as much in the same time period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most experts agreed that messages like “50 is the new 30” can be helpful if they convince people not to write themselves off as they age. It’s OK to push ourselves a bit physically. But the flip side is an assumption that a 50-year-old body isn’t different from a 30-year-old body. It is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable,” Finkelstein said. “We need to change our expectations and we need to change how we exercise as we get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-adapt-to-ageing-bodies-and-avoid-injury" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to adapt to ag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ing bodies and avoid injury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In midlife, we should all learn to be more in tune with our bodies. That might mean taking more recovery time between intense workouts, doing more stretching and integrating more weights into our fitness routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A healthy adaptive approach to exercising as we age might involve regular self-monitoring and assessment of how our bodies feel both during and after workouts, and seeking input from a qualified medical professional when we start to notice any signs or symptoms of an encroaching problem, such as pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leipzig suggests that physicians begin conversations about adjustments by asking patients what it is they love about an activity they’re holding on to. A tennis player might really love the social aspect. In that case, they could switch to pickleball – which is less taxing, but similar – with a complementary strength-training and stretching regimen to prevent injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But since risk of injury naturally rises as we age, it’s also important to have a backup plan for if and when we overdo it. When I talked to Dr Melissa Leber, associate professor of orthopedics and emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine, she had just finished working at the US Open. Leber has a lot of experience dealing with athletes – both professional and amateur – who have pushed themselves a bit too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Some people are really good at adjusting and they’re comfortable with their bodies changing,” Leber said. “Others go hardcore. I’ve seen some patients who don’t even want a day off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, if you’re a runner with an injury, try a modified strength-training routine and a lower-impact activity, like swimming. Then, when you start running again, run fewer times a week or for shorter distances. To avoid injury or overuse, experts recommend one or two rest days a week, at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strength training is also very important. “The stronger you are,” Leber said, “the more you will avoid injury and falls. And when you do fall, you will fall differently. Your balance will be better, and you’ll recover from injury faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a rule, Leber advises that someone in their 50s should spend 50% of their total exercise time on strength training and 50% doing cardio. By age 60, that metric should be 60% strength and 40% cardio. By 70, cardio should only comprise 30% of a workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of the experts I spoke to agree that pain should never be ignored – and it’s never a good idea to push through the pain without seeing your doctor. That being said, Finkelstein pointed out that most general physicians aren’t all that well-trained in exercise physiology. For specific recommendations pertaining to exercise regimens, it’s better to see a physiatrist, specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation or certified physical trainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I wish we were all better trained in that,” Finkelstein said, “because it’s so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"3b504e44-3a8d-480c-b083-5ebef6a11c4c","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="3b504e44-3a8d-480c-b083-5ebef6a11c4c" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To compound this, conversations about how to maintain muscle mass, bone health, aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness take more time than the average physician can spend with their patients. Many people fill that gap with advice from fitness influencers online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cultivating-realistic-expectations-of-ageing" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating realistic expectations of ag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Finkelstein worries about the effect of the media – especially social media, with its legions of wellness and anti-ageing influencers. “Take these supplements, do this exercise program, join this fitness routine: you name it, people are serving it up,” she said. “I worry a lot about that in terms of the reliability of those people and the science behind what they’re offering, and people being vulnerable to that because you want to do what you can to stay healthy and youthful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Popular media also loves to feature “superagers” – people whose mental and/or physical abilities are comparable to people 20-30 years younger. And while it’s good to see, say, an 87-year-old running a marathon, it may lead to false expectations about normal ageing. Superagers are rare; only about 10% of the general population fit all the criteria for inclusion in the category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting … that things are going to change&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, it’s not very realistic for those of us in our middle age or older to think we’ll rack up those personal bests forever. As the experts kept pointing out, the best approach to exercising as we age is realistic and adaptive. A runner who adapts to the changes of their ageing body and trains effectively may still be able to run the Boston marathon, but the time it takes for them to cross the finish line will necessarily lengthen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Part of the problem might be optimism bias. While we may logically understand that bodies change, we don’t think we are actually changing. Maybe that’s because we’re living in a culture that is obsessed not only with longevity, but with looking younger. The number of cosmetic procedures has &lt;a href="https://americanmedspa.org/news/isaps-releases-2024-global-survey-results-ranks-surgical-and-nonsurgical-procedure-popularity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased 42.5% globally&lt;/a&gt; over the last four years, and Americans spent an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/cosmetic-surgery-market" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$20bn on cosmetic surgery&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting the fact that things are going to change,” Leipzig said. “People are in better shape in general than they ever have been, if they’re privileged enough to be able to take care of their needs, but it leads them to think they will never die. It leads to ageism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And that’s the rub: being overly concerned with how much “younger” you are for your age is just another form of bias – one that you can hold against your future self. “Fifty is the new 30” simply underscores our misconception that being healthy means not ageing at all. It would be healthier if we occasionally reminded ourselves that ageing is a privilege; that “50 is 50” and “80 is 80” – and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOQWVTNzBBM215N2tUUUxmN2FKcDRKbXdDSzBibHZDU25QUnlacmRIMFlyN2hsMXVYMWM0SlphX09qNjhuS1BFSTQyRjc0ZGRMbGdEZFFJdlJYT0NJbnZyUlprQUZRZWFrSmw3Q3JmY2xhYlFxbEc0cVpoX2MyYmMzNEx5ZVB0cEhjUjZLTEpDRQ</guid></item><item><title>新的研究将褪黑激素与心力衰竭联系起来，但专家表示不要惊慌失措-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/03/melatonin-heart-failure-sleep-aid/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ILAJW3UZBCKRJD6OQXSXDLR7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A study that reviewed health records for tens of thousands of adults with chronic insomnia found that people who took prescribed melatonin for more than a year had a higher chance of heart failure over five years compared with people who were identified as nonusers, the American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/long-term-use-of-melatonin-supplements-to-support-sleep-may-have-negative-health-effects?preview=6f74&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" target="_blank"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.

It is considered extremely rare, with its true incidence unknown because it is often misdiagnosed or overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This doesn't just trick a breathalyzer. Fermenting yeast, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11354181/Fatal-fungi-releases-list-dangerous-fungal-pathogens-growing-threat.html"&gt;typically Candida albicans&lt;/a&gt;, creates real alcohol in the bloodstream, leading to the same stumbling, slurring and mental impairment as if Jane had been drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dean Mitchell, a prominent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-ad7bf510-b42f-11f0-8154-a97bfc676553"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; immunologist who works with ABS patients, told the Daily Mail: 'It's quite powerful to have somebody that literally didn't take a drink of alcohol and is failing a breathalyzer test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell pointed to a clear pattern in his auto-brewery syndrome patients. Every single one had recently taken antibiotics, which are known to disrupt the gut's natural balance of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;After taking antibiotics and acid reflux medicine, teacher and mother Jane began fermenting carbs into alcohol in her gut. This condition caused her to fail breathalyzer tests twice while completely sober (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics wipe out both harmful and beneficial gut bacteria, creating a void that allows Candida yeast to proliferate unchecked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, after grabbing a cupcake to eat on her way home, a quick burst of sugar to carry her through dinner time, Jane soon felt bloated in her stomach and her concentration had become cloudy. Before she knew it, she had run a red light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A police officer pulled her over, suspecting she was drunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her denial, a breathalyzer test confirmed his suspicion, leading to a citation and a court summons for a DUI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a second, equally baffling incident in which a police officer pulled her over, she was desperate for a medical explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It would be weeks before Jane’s doctor could issue and explain the diagnosis, auto-brewery syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A specific yeast in her gut, Candida, was fermenting the carbohydrates in her food, effectively brewing alcohol inside her own body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it all may have stemmed from antibiotic use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Once she was diagnosed with ABS, Jane finally had an explanation for her crippling fatigue, her brain fog and slurred speech, especially after eating carb-heavy foods (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Dr Dean Mitchell, a prominent New York City immunologist, told the Daily Mail that nearly all of his patients with Candida overgrowth have a history of long-term antibiotic use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell told the Daily Mail that widespread over-prescription of antibiotics ‘is a little bit heartbreaking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘I see a lot of young people who've been on tetracycline for six months for acne, or I see people for chronic Lyme disease, the chronic sinus and bronchitis patients and the urinary tract patients. I'm not a believer that long-term antibiotics help those patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients journey to his New York City clinic reporting the same core symptoms: stubborn fatigue, brain fog, and bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For some, this progresses to full-scale intoxication, including dizziness, slurred speech, and blood alcohol levels sufficient to fail a breathalyzer test despite complete sobriety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He first rules out conditions like anemia. If standard tests are normal and the patient has a history of triggers like antibiotics or acid blockers, he uses a 15-questionnaire to help confirm a diagnosis of Candida overgrowth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He categorizes the condition into four stages. It typically begins with digestive issues like bloating after high-carb meals, then progresses to localized problems such as chronic sinusitis, vaginitis and unexplained rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell said: ‘Patients that I would see with chronic sinusitis and sometimes the other symptoms, like the GI symptoms, they're like, oh my god, I’ve seen an [ear, nose and throat doctor] for two years. He keeps on giving me antibiotics, he gives me steroids and I've had two operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then all of a sudden, I treat them for the Candida overgrowth and their sinuses get better and their fatigue gets better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Candida albicans, the yeast that causes ABS, is now a WHO "priority pathogen" because of its drug resistance. Though normally harmless in the gut, it becomes dangerous in immunocompromised individuals &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third stage involves debilitating neurological symptoms, such as severe brain fog that can be so intense that patients have had to leave their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell added: ‘I have these 20-year-olds say, ‘I have to leave my job. I'm working in finance and I can't do the rigors of what I need to do,’ and I work with them and they get better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most severe stage encompasses systemic illness, including profound chronic fatigue and body-wide pain similar to fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell's treatment begins with antifungal medication and a strict 30-day, low-carb diet to starve the yeast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then repairs the gut using targeted vitamins and nutrients to reduce inflammation and repopulate the microbiome with beneficial bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And in similar individuals who walk further, taking 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day, decline slows by an average of 7 years. The work also offers hints to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;how exercise alters the brain&lt;/a&gt; to offer this protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The very encouraging takeaway is that even a little bit of exercise seems to help,” says Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, a physician-scientist specializing in memory disorders at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and a co-author of the study, which was published on 3 November in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;. The research indicates that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03513-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03513-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people don’t need to take 10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt;, a goal that is often touted but might be hard for some older individuals to attain, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Steps towards prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team ran regular checks on 296 people participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a programme that is investigating the early stages of Alzheimer’s. None of them had signs of cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. Over a period of up to 14 years, the team periodically assessed the participants — whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 — using cognitive tests and brain scans. Participants were also asked to wear pedometers to measure how many steps they took each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of people at a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease usually show an abnormal build-up of two proteins: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02535-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02535-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;amyloid-β and tau&lt;/a&gt;. Although the relationship between the two proteins is not fully understood, amyloid-β levels begin to increase first, followed by tau levels. Cognitive decline seems to be more closely tied to the accumulation of tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of taking 3,000 to 7,500 steps per day were apparent only for participants with high baseline levels of amyloid-β in their brains. Their mental decline was slowed — by 3 to 7 years — compared with participants who were sedentary. The researchers didn’t see any further slowing of mental decline in participants who took more than 7,500 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A large study from Massachusetts found that &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/9900/neurodevelopmental_outcomes_of_3_year_old_children.1392.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;babies whose mothers had COVID-19 while pregnant&lt;/a&gt; were slightly more likely to have a range of neurodevelopmental diagnoses by age 3. Most of these children had speech or motor delays, and the link was strongest when the mother was infected late in pregnancy and in boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in risk was small for any one child, but because millions of women were pregnant during the pandemic, even a small increase matters. The study doesn't prove that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy causes autism or other brain conditions in the fetus, but it suggests that infections and inflammation during pregnancy can affect how a baby's brain grows, something scientists have seen before with other illnesses. It's reason to help pregnant women avoid COVID-19 and to keep a close eye on children who were exposed in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital examined medical records from more than 18,000 mothers and their children born between March 2020 and May 2021, before vaccines were widely available. Because everyone giving birth during that period was tested for COVID, the team could clearly see which pregnancies were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5% of those mothers had COVID while pregnant. Their children were modestly more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition by age 3 than those whose mothers weren't infected, even after accounting for differences in maternal age, race, insurance status, and preterm birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link appeared strongest when infection occurred in the third trimester and among boys. Still, the vast majority of children in both groups showed typical development.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was a very clean group to follow," said Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General and one of the study's authors. "Because of universal testing early in the pandemic, we knew who had COVID and who didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say COVID, which causes a powerful immune response in some people, fits the biological pattern seen with other infections in pregnancy. Dr. Alan Brown, a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia University, who studies maternal infection and brain development, explained, "COVID would be a very strong candidate for it to happen because the amount of inflammation is very extreme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How might infection affect brain development?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still piecing together how various types of infections in pregnancy affect fetal development. Severe illness can cause inflammation that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3978" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;disrupts brain growth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1307582110" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;trigger preterm birth&lt;/a&gt;, which carries its own risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a long history of evidence showing that maternal infection can slightly raise the risk for many neurodevelopmental disorders," said Dr. Roy Perlis, the vice chair for research in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edlow's lab is investigating how infection and inflammation may interfere with brain development. In a healthy brain, immune cells help shape developing neural circuits by trimming away extra or unnecessary connections, a process known as "synaptic pruning," which sculpts the brain's wiring. When a mother's immune system is activated by infection, inflammatory molecules can reach the fetal brain and alter the pruning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag3194" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Animal studies&lt;/a&gt; support Edlow's hypothesis. When scientists trigger inflammation in pregnant mice, their offspring often show changes in how brain cells grow and connect, changes that can alter learning and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why late pregnancy and why boys?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Edlow and Perlis' study, the link between COVID and developmental delays was strongest when infection occurred late in pregnancy, during the third trimester. That's also when the fetal brain is growing most rapidly, forming and refining millions of neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we think of organ development, we think earlier in pregnancy, but the brain is an exception in this regard, where there's a massive amount of brain development in the third trimester. And that continues after birth," said Perlis. "It is entirely plausible that the third trimester is a period of vulnerability specifically for brain development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone agrees the third trimester is uniquely vulnerable. Dr. Brian Lee, a professor of epidemiology at Drexel University, cautioned that because most mothers in the study were tested at delivery, there were simply more late-pregnancy infections to analyze. "That gives the study more power to find a difference in the third trimester," he said. "It doesn't prove earlier infections aren't important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found stronger effects in boys. That pattern is familiar: boys are generally more likely than girls to have speech or motor delays and to be diagnosed with autism. Researchers suspect that male fetuses may be more sensitive to stress and inflammation before birth, though the biology isn't fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study can and can't show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edlow and Perlis are careful to say the study shows an association, not proof that COVID infection in pregnancy causes developmental problems. &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(22)00264-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Many other factors&lt;/a&gt; could explain the link.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mothers who get sick with COVID may also have other health issues, like obesity, diabetes or mental health conditions, that increase the risk of developmental delays in children. "Persons with &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20806" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mental disorders&lt;/a&gt; are much more likely to get COVID. Women with mental disorders are much &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1536042/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more likely to have kids with neurodevelopmental problems&lt;/a&gt;," Lee said. "Mothers with &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;worse physical health&lt;/a&gt; are also at higher risk of having children with neurodevelopmental problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee's research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159114004528?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;even infections before or after pregnancy can be linked to autism&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that shared genetics or environment, rather than the infection itself, could be at play. That's why experts say much larger, longer studies are needed to understand the extent of any risk from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edlow, Perlis and their team plan to follow the children in their study as they grow older to see whether early differences persist or fade. They're also studying how inflammation during pregnancy affects the placenta and fetal brain, and how to counteract those effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this study followed pregnancies from early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available, it doesn't answer whether vaccination changes the risk. But other research offers reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large national study in Scotland &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352464225000082" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;found no difference in early developmental outcomes&lt;/a&gt; between children whose mothers were vaccinated and those who weren't. Another study in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2814106" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;found the same&lt;/a&gt;: no link between prenatal COVID vaccination and developmental delays through 18 months. Both align with decades of data showing that vaccination during pregnancy is safe for both the mother and the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is a short spike… your immune system revs up, then it goes back to normal," said Edlow. "COVID [infection] is much more prolonged, unpredictable, and people can get… a dysregulated immune phenomenon that really doesn't exist in vaccine responses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for parents and clinicians&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since late 2020, there's been widespread confusion and misinformation about the safety of COVID vaccination during pregnancy. Some women have hesitated to get vaccinated out of fear it might harm their baby. But the evidence since then has been clear: the COVID vaccine is safe in pregnancy.

&lt;p&gt;Experts say the broader lesson is that pregnancy is a period of vulnerability, and prevention matters, not only &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-study-unvaccinated-pregnant-women-stillbirth/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;for COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but other infections as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Janet Currie, a professor of economics at Yale University, said these risks remain "underappreciated," despite decades of evidence. "Even though the flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, very few pregnant women get it," she said. "Physicians seem to be reluctant to vaccinate pregnant women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Gil Mor, scientific director of the C.S. Mott Center for Human Growth and Development at Wayne State University, put it, "Protecting the mother is protecting the long-term health of the offspring. … The best intervention is vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A century-old echo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that what happens in the womb can shape life after birth began with studies of famine, like the Dutch Hunger Winter in the final months of World War II. Between 1944 and 1945, as German forces blockaded the western Netherlands, rations fell to just a few hundred calories a day. Thousands died of starvation, and women who were pregnant during that period gave birth to babies who later faced higher risks of &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/84/6/595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)07244-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/495981" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. The episode became a cornerstone of the "&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)90710-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fetal origins&lt;/a&gt;" idea, that deprivation or stress in pregnancy can have lifelong effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.25.3.153" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1918 flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; broadened that idea to infection. Babies exposed to influenza in utero later showed small but lasting &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/507154" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;differences in education and earnings&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first signs that illness during pregnancy could affect brain development. Research in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24997382/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2727135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953611006368" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691044/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28371628/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; found similar impacts. Some argued that those findings reflected the &lt;a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;disruptions of World War I&lt;/a&gt;, not the flu itself. But &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;later studies&lt;/a&gt;, including those from the &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41304838" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/494237" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, have strengthened the case for a biological effect, reinforcing that the infection itself, not wartime upheaval, was the key driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It isn't simply influenza that can alter fetal neurodevelopment," Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UW Medicine, explained. "Many types of infections… in the mother can be transmitted as a signal to the fetus, which can alter its brain development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A century later, the same question has returned with COVID: could infection during pregnancy subtly shape how children grow and learn? The new Massachusetts General Hospital study offers an early look at the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

The research indicates that using playful or childish terms for genitals in everyday life is linked to more negative outcomes, while using vulgar terms during sex is connected to more positive sexual experiences. The findings were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-025-01619-w" target="_blank"&gt;Sex Roles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many scholars and educators believe language shapes our body image, this idea has rarely been put to the test. A team of researchers led by Tanja Oschatz of Johannes-Gutenberg-University and Rotem Kahalon of Bar-Ilan University aimed to provide the missing scientific evidence, particularly regarding the terms women use for their genitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For years, both feminist scholars and sex educators have emphasized that language matters—that the words we use to talk about our bodies can shape how we feel about them. Yet, despite this widely accepted idea, there was surprisingly little empirical evidence showing how this plays out with regards to women’s genitals,” Oschatz told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although there were studies from 20 year ago that catalogued the many terms women use to describe their genitals, no one had examined whether using different terms is actually linked to women’s feelings, attitudes, or behaviors. Our first goal was to close this gap.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Secondly, we wanted to update previous findings on women’s genital naming. Language is constantly evolving—especially around gender, sexuality, and the body. What women call their genitals today may carry different meanings and social implications than it did two decades ago, and we wanted to capture this contemporary picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their study, the researchers surveyed 457 women from the United States with diverse ages. Participants were asked what terms they most commonly use to refer to their genitals in two different scenarios: a general, non-sexual context and a partnered, sexual context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women also completed a series of questionnaires designed to measure their feelings and attitudes. These included scales assessing their genital self-image, their overall sexual pleasure, orgasm frequency, attitudes toward oral sex, and certain health-related behaviors, such as the use of vaginal cleaning products and their openness to labiaplasty, a type of cosmetic genital surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After collecting the terms, the researchers performed a content analysis and grouped the words into nine distinct categories. These categories included anatomical (e.g., “vagina,” “vulva”), vulgar (e.g., “pussy”), playful/childish (e.g., “hoo-ha,” “vajayjay”), and euphemisms (e.g., “down there,” “private parts”), among others. The team then used statistical analyses to see if using terms from a particular category was associated with the participants’ self-reported attitudes and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, non-sexual contexts, the study found that a majority of women, about 75%, reported using at least one anatomical term, with “vagina” being the most frequent. However, playful/childish terms and euphemisms were also common, each used by roughly 15% of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that genital naming among women is very diverse—and that it depends strongly on the context,” Oschatz explained. “For example, when women were asked, ‘What term do you generally use?’, the majority mentioned at least one anatomical term such as ‘vagina’ or ‘vulva.’ In contrast, when asked what term they use in a sexual context, most women reported using more informal or vulgar terms like ‘pussy.’ Compared to data from twenty years ago, we also found that the term ‘vulva’ (referring to the outer parts of women’s genitals) and words referring to the clitoris have become more common, suggesting a more differentiated and anatomically informed vocabulary today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that women who used playful/childish terms tended to report a more negative genital self-image. This connection appeared to extend to other areas as well. The use of these terms was also linked to a lower perception of a partner’s enjoyment of giving oral sex, a greater likelihood of using vaginal cleaning products, and a higher interest in getting labiaplasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a more negative genital self-image helped explain the connection between using playful terms and the greater openness to labiaplasty, as well as the lower perceived partner enjoyment of oral sex. This suggests that the negative feelings women have about their genitals may be a key factor driving these other outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that the words women use are indeed related to their attitudes and experiences,” Oschatz told PsyPost. “Women who used childish terms such as ‘hoo-ha’ or ‘vajayjay’ tended to report more negative feelings about their genitals. These terms were also linked to sexual and health behaviors and attitudes—such as a more negative perception of partner’s oral sex enjoyment, greater use of vaginal cleaning products, and higher openness to labiaplasty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers analyzed the terms women used in a sexual context with a partner, the linguistic landscape changed significantly. In this setting, the most common category was vulgar terms, with nearly 45% of women reporting their use. The most frequent word in this category was “pussy.” Anatomical terms were the second most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed that using vulgar terms during sex was associated with positive sexual outcomes. Women who used these terms reported experiencing greater general sexual pleasure, more frequent orgasms, and a stronger desire to receive oral sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Context really matters,” Oschatz emphasized. “The associations between language and attitudes differed depending on when the terms were used. For instance, childish terms were linked to more negative feelings only when used in non-sexual contexts, but not during sexual ones. Interestingly, using the word ‘pussy’ in sexual contexts was associated with greater sexual pleasure and more frequent orgasms. This suggests that a word once considered derogatory may now be reclaimed by many women and carry an element of empowerment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what researchers expected, the use of euphemisms was not associated with a negative genital self-image or any other adverse outcomes in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that using euphemisms—vague and indirect terms like ‘own there’ or ‘private area’—was not associated with more negative attitudes toward women’s own genitals,” Oschatz said. “We had expected that these terms might carry an element of shame or discomfort, which could be linked to a more negative genital self-image. However, our findings suggest otherwise. Instead, it was really the use of childish language that was related to negative feelings and attitudes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, the study has some limitations. The participants were predominantly white and highly educated, so the findings may not apply to women from other racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic backgrounds where language and cultural norms may differ. The research was also focused exclusively on cisgender women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, because the study shows a correlation, it cannot determine causation. It is unclear if using certain words influences a woman’s feelings and behaviors, or if her existing feelings and behaviors influence her choice of words. It is also possible that the relationship works in both directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore these dynamics in more diverse populations and use methods that help establish the direction of the relationship over time. Researchers also suggest a deeper exploration into the complex nature of reclaimed terms to better understand how and when they contribute to a sense of genuine empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors note that the findings have practical implications, particularly for health and education. Discouraging infantilizing language and promoting the use of accurate anatomical terms in medical, educational, and family settings could help reduce shame and improve body literacy and well-being among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11199-025-01619-w" target="_blank"&gt;Vagina, Pussy, Vulva, Vag – Women’s Names for Their Genitals are Differentially Associated with Sexual and Health Outcomes&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tanja Oschatz, Verena Klein, Veronica Kovalcik, and Rotem Kahalon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 15:07:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNRkc0MlcybVd6bmduYmRQeFREUC1LYzFJbUhpbGd1UXJUYWZfOUc3eWxqbURVTG9rOGdBaV8waWF6b3dIbTBWelZKaTFZV2tBaUhtRC1jR0g0T0F5MFhEbGxQUks1R3Q1cXBoZG1OSDduR3BTSUxaZlZqdWFselZiVVFTSlVsUmZyc2JwOGFSRGkyQXktNzAtWVVGdkRnelhuOG5MOEI3M0J3VmgzcU80ZA</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现，人类的心脏可以自我修复-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/11/03/human-heart-fix-itself-icahn-school-of-medicine-mount-sinai/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;When someone has a heart attack or heart failure, heart muscle cells are lost and the heart cannot replace them and there is no current way to grow new heart muscle cells after damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than one million people in Britain are living with heart failure, with around 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year and the only options are medications to help manage symptoms, stents, valve repairs, heart bypass or a transplant. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/heart-disease/"&gt;Heart diseases&lt;/a&gt; are currently the second-largest cause of death in Britain each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new technique harnesses the power of a naturally-occurring gene called Cyclin A2 or, CCNA2, which plays a critical role in cell division and growth during foetal development but ceases activity shortly after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reactivating this gene enables the production of new cardiomyocytes – heart muscle cells – which can repair damaged areas of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team inserted the gene into a harmless virus and tested it directly in living adult human heart cells in culture from 41 and 55-year-old hearts. They used time-lapse imaging to analyse the heart cells with CCNA2 and saw that they began to divide successfully, keeping their structure and function and demonstrating normal protein and calcium activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that CCNA2 helps heart cells “turn back the clock” by reactivating growth genes so they can divide and repair the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chaudhry said: “This is the culmination of nearly two decades of work. We pioneered the concept that the heart could be regenerated by reawakening dormant cell division genes, and now we’ve brought that vision one step closer to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to deliver a therapy that allows the heart to heal itself after a heart attack or in heart failure, reducing the need for transplants or mechanical devices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are now seeking approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials of CCNA2 therapy in patients with heart disease. The research was published in the journal Regenerative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

The bacteria is often found in natural and man-made water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;When contaminated water is inhaled, i.e. in the shower or from air conditioning, the bacteria can enter the lungs and cause an infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The disease is not contagious and cannot be spread from person to person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Cincinnati Health Department, Hamilton County Public Health and the Ohio Department of Health are conducting additional water tests at Christ Hospital’s main campus in response to the two cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The departments are also installing filters on faucets and showers while testing continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“As part of its standard safety practice, The Christ Hospital routinely monitors, tests, and treats its water systems to minimize the presence of Legionella and other waterborne pathogens,” The Christ Hospital Health Network wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;As of now, the network says there is no indication the hospital’s water is unsafe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The risk to patients, visitors and staff is low, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;See a spelling or grammatical error in our story? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fox19.com/page/report-typos-to-fox19/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please click here to report it&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | text-start article-text"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a photo or video of a breaking news story?

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Caffeine and sugar-spiked energy drinks promise a quick pick-me-up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yet experts say that frequently consuming these drinks could be harming your liver.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you need a little extra energy, try a cup of unsweetened coffee or tea instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching for a caffeinated drink can help kickstart your day or power you through an afternoon slump. In fact, 90% of us consume caffeine on a daily basis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But if you usually get your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061814/are-energy-drinks-healthy/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine kick from an energy drink&lt;/a&gt;, it could spell trouble for your liver health. “Energy drinks are defined as over-the-counter commercial beverages with high caffeine content that are advertised to boost energy, including mental alertness and physical performance,” says &lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;  While they may seem like harmless, fizzy alternatives to coffee, they affect your body–and your liver–very differently than the average cup of joe. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Read on to find out what the experts have to say about energy drinks and your liver health, plus their suggestions for healthier alternatives to keep you energized. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can Deliver Lots of Caffeine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine is a natural stimulant that can help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-for-more-energy-today-11770029" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;feel more energized and alert&lt;/a&gt;. But you can have too much of a good thing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that adults consume no more than &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;400 milligrams of caffeine per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A 12-ounce energy drink can contain anywhere from 40 mg of caffeine on the low end, to 250 mg on the high end (and 16-ounce cans may pack even more). So, if you down a couple of cans a day, you could be consuming &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-sources-of-caffeine-8647888" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;unhealthy amounts of caffeine&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What does all of this mean for your liver? As your body’s primary detoxification system, your liver has to process that flood of caffeine. While the occasional energy drink isn’t likely to cause liver problems, regularly drinking large amounts of highly caffeinated ones could lead to liver injury over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Coffee, by comparison, has been linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-better-liver-health-11800733" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better liver health&lt;/a&gt;, most likely due to its more than 1,000 bioactive compounds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To complicate matters, energy drinks can be marketed as supplements. When they are, they aren’t required by law to list their caffeine on the Nutrition Facts panel. That means you could be getting a lot more caffeine than you bargained for.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can be Packed with Added Sugars &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It doesn’t help that energy drinks are super-sweet, says &lt;a href="http://gooseberry-health.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Isabel Balady, RD, CDN&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike naturally bitter coffee or tea, it’s easy to guzzle a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/102230/shocking-levels-of-sugar-in-8-popular-beverages/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sugary-sweet energy drink&lt;/a&gt; just like soda. Those sugars may be great for providing an initial rush of energy. But it’s usually short-lived and can leave you feeling drained later on. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since your liver is responsible for ensuring that your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blood sugar levels remain steady&lt;/a&gt;, consuming too much added sugar day after day can adversely impact your liver health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research has found that regularly drinking sugar-sweetened beverages–like energy drinks–can cause fat to build up in the liver. This may lead to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/having-diabetes-can-increase-your-risk-of-liver-disease-heres-what-you-can-do-to-help-8399481" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nonalcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; (NAFLD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Over time, this can impair liver function and cause inflammation,” explains &lt;a href="http://www.oswalddigestiveclinic.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcie Vaske, M.S., LN, CNS&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How much sugar are we talking about? Some energy drinks pack 54 to 62 grams of sugar per 16-ounce can. To put that into perspective, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting added sugar to no more than 10% of daily calories.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s roughly 12 teaspoons (or 50 grams) of added sugar for someone who eats about 2,000 calories a day. So, should you be reaching for a sugar-free energy drink instead? While these may seem like a healthier choice, there’s new evidence that even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-surprising-drink-that-could-increase-your-risk-of-heart-disease-11705434" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;artificially-sweetened drinks&lt;/a&gt; may raise your odds of liver disease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Can Contain Harmful Doses of Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Energy drinks often contain a cocktail of supplemental ingredients like vitamins and minerals, as well as herbs like guarana and ginkgo biloba. These ingredients are often marketed as “natural,”  which makes them seem wholesome. But it’s your liver's job to process them all. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One seemingly innocent ingredient commonly added to energy drinks is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, B vitamins play an active role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291451/will-vitamin-b12-give-me-energy/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. However, energy drinks often contain considerably more than we really need, even to the point that they may be harmful to your liver. For example, niacin is an important B vitamin, but too much of it can potentially lead to liver toxicity. Some research has even linked high-niacin energy drinks to the development of hepatitis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-healthier-alternatives"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Healthier Alternatives &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The occasional energy drink is OK for most healthy people. However, if you’re frequently relying on their higher wattage to keep you awake and alert, it may be time to find a healthier alternative, like one of these: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coffee:&lt;/strong&gt; Many people love the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine boost of a cup of joe&lt;/a&gt;. Coffee also happens to be packed with loads of health-promoting compounds. Some of these may actually lower the risk of liver disease when consumed in moderate amounts, says Balady.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tea: &lt;/strong&gt;While green and black tea have less caffeine than coffee, they contain an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7866840/foods-to-eat-to-stay-energized/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;energy-boosting amino acid&lt;/a&gt; called L-theanine. This amino acid has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7907172/what-are-nootropics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;promote attention and focus&lt;/a&gt;, without the jitters of caffeine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water: &lt;/strong&gt;Being dehydrated can leave you sluggish. Instead of reaching for caffeine, try a glass of water first. If plain water is a turn-off, Vaske recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-ingredient-to-upgrade-your-water-fruit-11783370" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;water infused with a little fruit&lt;/a&gt; to support hydration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-Fat Milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Sure, milk doesn’t contain caffeine. But that doesn’t mean it can’t give you a bit of the energy you’re looking for. Thanks to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-electrolytes-8645417" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;electrolytes, like potassium&lt;/a&gt;, milk is an excellent choice for fending off dehydration. Plus, its &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;natural sugars&lt;/a&gt; can boost energy levels while its protein helps sustain them for longer. A winning combo if you ask us! &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Marketed as energy in a bottle with enticing flavors like “Watermelon Wave”, “Sherbet Swirl” or “Punched Hardcore Apple,” it’s no wonder energy drinks are skyrocketing in popularity. While they may seem like innocent alternatives to coffee, experts warn that their combination of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-drink-too-much-coffee-in-the-am-11758446" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, added sugars and supplemental ingredients can pose potential health risks for your liver. While the occasional quick fix of an energy drink is OK for most of us, making them your go-to could spell trouble for your health, especially your liver. Next time you need a kick, grab a cup of unsweetened coffee or tea. They’re loaded with compounds that protect your liver and are likely lower in caffeine than most energy drinks. Plus, they’re naturally sugar-free. No matter which drink you choose for energy, don’t forget the basics, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;quality sleep&lt;/a&gt;, adequate hydration and plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy, whole foods&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll keep your energy levels up in the long run, far better than any drink can.&lt;br&gt;

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), "An estimated 1.4 billion adults aged 30–79 years worldwide had hypertension in 2024; this represents 33% of the population in this age range." However, high blood pressure often doesn't show clear symptoms until it is too late. "An estimated 600 million adults with hypertension (44%) are unaware that they have the condition," the WHO states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so, your lifestyle-- which includes your everyday diet plays a huge role in managing it. Certain foods can help relax blood vessels, reduce sodium levels, and improve heart health, while others can silently push your blood pressure higher. Thus, making simple changes in your food habits can show great effects on your overall well-being. Here we list some of the best foods one should have and the worst foods one should avoid for high blood pressure (BP):&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 13:14:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>想要降低血压？营养师说您需要更多这4种营养素- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/nutrients-for-better-blood-pressure-11841273</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For healthy blood pressure, prioritize eating foods rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This means filling up on plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low- or non-fat dairy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure to get plenty of exercise and sleep, reduce your stress levels, and limit alcohol, as well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your blood pressure is one of those vital signs your doctor likely measures every time you step inside their office, and for good reason: Over time, high blood pressure (also called hypertension) can have &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;serious consequences for your heart&lt;/a&gt;, brain, kidneys and other organs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that certain lifestyle changes can help bring your blood pressure into a healthy range (ideally below 120/80 mm Hg), including tweaking your diet to prioritize &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15297/our-top-15-heart-healthy-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Food can influence blood volume, artery flexibility and how your body &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894212/ways-to-flush-out-excess-sodium-from-your-body/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;regulates sodium and fluid balance&lt;/a&gt;, all of which affect blood pressure," says &lt;a href="https://kimblum.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kim Blum, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, here are the top nutrients for better blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-potassium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Potassium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For healthy blood pressure, several decades of research support following the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-dash-diet-meal-plan-for-beginners-11738768" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) eating plan&lt;/a&gt;, which includes foods high in potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bananas, avocados, potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans and dark leafy greens are all rich in this nutrient.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium plays a key role in reducing blood pressure because it helps your body &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7900585/foods-for-when-youve-had-too-much-sodium/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flush out excess sodium&lt;/a&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://brittanyb.ca/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brittany Brown, RD&lt;/a&gt;. Too much sodium can increase blood pressure in some people, but potassium helps shuttle it out of your body through your urine. Potassium also lowers blood pressure by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;relaxing your blood vessels&lt;/a&gt;, allowing blood to flow through more easily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "When potassium levels drop too low, your arteries can stiffen and lose flexibility, leading to higher blood pressure over time," says &lt;a href="https://www.leisanoliving.com/meet-leisan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Leisan Echols, M.S., RDN, CSCS&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with limiting sodium, the American Heart Association recommends getting between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;3,500 and 5,000 milligrams of potassium&lt;/a&gt; per day (from food) if you're trying to prevent or treat hypertension. To put that into perspective, one medium banana delivers about 450 mg of potassium, while a cup of cooked sweet potato contains about 570 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-magnesium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is another featured nutrient in the DASH diet. Like potassium, it can be found in a variety of heart-healthy foods, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vegetables-to-eat-each-week-11746040" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;leafy greens, legumes, nuts&lt;/a&gt;, seeds and whole grains such as brown rice and oatmeal.6 It's also added to some fortified foods, like certain breakfast cereals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Magnesium helps relax muscles, which include the walls of your arteries," explains &lt;a href="https://www.healthyyoubymaura.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maura Fowler, M.P.H, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. "If you don’t eat enough foods with magnesium, it could lead to constricted arteries," which increases blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-rich-foods-11772823" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recommended dietary allowance for magnesium&lt;/a&gt; in adults is 310 to 420 mg, depending on age and sex. An ounce of roasted pumpkin seeds has 156 mg, which gets you more than a third of the way to the higher end of that goal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research also notes that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-11836271" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplements may help&lt;/a&gt; lower BP in people who have high blood pressure and low magnesium levels, but you should always talk to your doctor before starting a supplement to make sure it's right for you.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-calcium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Calcium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A third star of the DASH eating plan is the mineral calcium, which is prominent in dairy foods such as milk, yogurt and cheese as well as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium-fortified milk substitutes&lt;/a&gt;, fruit juices, tofu, and cereals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Calcium helps blood vessels tighten and relax as needed," Blum says, which lowers blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. The DASH eating plan recommends that most adults get two to three servings of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031955/is-dairy-good-for-you/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fat-free or low-fat dairy&lt;/a&gt; each day. A serving is 1 cup of milk or yogurt or 1.5 ounces of cheese.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-fiber"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike potassium, magnesium and calcium, fiber isn't a mineral. Instead, it's a type of carbohydrate found mainly in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8060938/live-longer-fight-climate-change-eat-more-plants/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, and whole grains—all of which feature prominently in the DASH eating plan.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber works behind the scenes to influence your blood pressure in more ways than one. "It fuels the good bacteria in your gut, which produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate that help reduce inflammation and keep your blood vessels functioning smoothly," Echols says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Fiber also supports better blood sugar control, improves insulin sensitivity, and contributes to weight management, all of which lighten the load on your cardiovascular system."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lentils, collard greens, oats, raspberries, and chia seeds are some of Echols' favorite high-fiber picks. "They’re flexible enough to build into soups, salads and warm breakfast bowls without overthinking it," she notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The DASH eating plan recommends most adults get three to five servings of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2061187/these-are-the-12-most-filling-fruits-and-veggies-according-to-dietitians/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich vegetables and fruits&lt;/a&gt; as well as four to eight servings of whole grains each day and three to five servings of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;nuts, seeds, and legumes&lt;/a&gt; per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-support-blood-pressure"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Strategies to Support Blood Pressure &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Outside of diet, other lifestyle habits that may help manage blood pressure include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Regular exercise (at least 150 minutes per week)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quitting smoking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting alcohol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Losing weight if you have overweight or obesity &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Getting enough quality sleep (least seven hours each night)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For healthy blood pressure, prioritize eating foods rich in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber each day, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low- or non-fat dairy. To complement this heart-healthy eating plan, make sure to get plenty of exercise and sleep, reduce your stress levels, and limit tobacco and alcohol.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Keep calm and try &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;. The fatty acids, available as dietary supplements via fish oil capsules and thought to help with mental and physical well-being, could also cut down on aggression, according to a 2024 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings haven't come out of nowhere: omega-3 has previously been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fish-oil-helps-at-risk-teenagers-avoid-schizophrenia-even-8-years-later"&gt;preventing schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, while aggression and antisocial behavior are thought in part to stem from a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/190990"&gt;lack of nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. What we eat can influence our brain's chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania built on earlier, smaller studies of omega-3 supplementation effects on aggression. Their  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="179839" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; looked at 29 randomized controlled trials across 3,918 participants in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/angry-outbursts-could-literally-be-putting-some-peoples-heart-at-risk"&gt;Angry Outbursts Could Literally Be Putting Some People's Heart at Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all the trials, a modest but noticeable short-term effect was found, translating to up to a 28 percent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/venting-doesnt-reduce-anger-but-something-else-does-study-finds"&gt;reduction in aggression&lt;/a&gt; across multiple different variables (including age, gender, medical diagnosis, and length and dosage of treatment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the time has come to implement omega-3 supplementation to reduce aggression, irrespective of whether the setting is the community, the clinic, or the criminal justice system," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neurocriminologist Adrian Raine when the meta-analysis was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149438" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview.jpg" alt="Flow diagram detailing steps of review process." class="wp-image-149438 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview.jpg 673w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-642x495.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-538x415.jpg 538w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/FowDiagramDetailingProcessOfReview-600x463.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149438" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flow diagram of literature search leading to 28 suitable papers. (Raine &amp;amp; Brodrick, &lt;em&gt;Aggression and Violent Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trials included in the study, carried out between 1996 and 2024, ran for an average of 16 weeks. They covered a variety of demographics, from &lt;a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jcpp.12314"&gt;children aged 16 and under&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10284150290007119"&gt;older people aged between 50 and 60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the reductions in aggression included both reactive aggression (in response to provocation) and proactive aggression (behavior planned in advance). Before this study, it wasn't clear if omega-3 could help with these different types of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies across longer periods of time are going to be needed to further establish this relationship, it adds to our understanding of how fish oil pills and the omega-3 in them might be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-kids-with-adhd-may-see-improvement-with-fish-oil-pills-but-results-are-mixed"&gt;beneficial for the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the very least, parents seeking treatment for an aggressive child should know that in addition to any other treatment that their child receives, an extra portion or two of fish each week could also help," Raine &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ExamplesOfFoodsThatHaveOmega3-e1736917333981.jpeg" alt="One Dietary Supplement Found to Reduce Aggression by Up to 28%" class="size-full wp-image-149436" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Natural sources of omega-3 in foods. (Ekaterina Kapranova/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think something in the way that omega-3 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327816302198"&gt;reduces inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and keeps vital brain processes &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3820"&gt;ticking over&lt;/a&gt; might be helping regulate aggression. There are still a lot of unanswered questions, but the team suggests there's enough evidence to look into this further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2154"&gt;the studies that show&lt;/a&gt; that medications derived from fish oil can help reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks, strokes, and other heart health problems, and there seems to be plenty of upside to adding some omega-3 to your diet.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long-term use of melatonin supplements, often used to promote sleep and address insomnia, was associated with a higher risk of heart failure diagnosis, heart failure hospitalization and death from any cause in chronic insomnia, according to a preliminary study to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2025. The meeting, Nov. 7-10, in New Orleans, is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced in the body by the pineal gland, and it helps regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin levels increase during darkness and decrease during daylight. Chemically identical synthetic versions of the hormone are often used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling and/or staying asleep) and jet lag. The supplements are widely available over the counter in many countries, including the U.S. In the U.S., over-the-counter supplements are not regulated, so each brand of supplement can vary in strength, purity, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, researchers classified people who had used melatonin long-term (with long-term use defined as a year or more documented in their electronic health records) as part of the "melatonin group." In contrast, those who never had melatonin recorded anywhere in their medical records were classified as the "non-melatonin group."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Melatonin supplements may not be as harmless as commonly assumed. If our study is confirmed, this could affect how doctors counsel patients about sleep aids."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, M.D., lead author of the study and chief resident in internal medicine at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in Brooklyn, New York&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melatonin supplements are promoted and marketed as a safe sleep aid; however, data demonstrating their long-term cardiovascular safety are lacking, which prompted the researchers to examine whether melatonin use alters the risk of heart failure, specifically in chronic insomnia patients. According to the American Heart Association's 2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics, heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs for them to function properly and is a common condition that affects 6.7 million adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a large international database (the TriNetX Global Research Network), the researchers reviewed 5 years of electronic health records for adults with chronic insomnia who had melatonin recorded in their health records and used it for more than a year. They were matched with peers in the database who also had insomnia but never had melatonin recorded in their health records. People were excluded from the analysis if they had previously been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other sleep medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Among adults with insomnia, those whose electronic health records indicated long-term melatonin use (12 months or more) had about a 90% higher chance of incident heart failure over 5 years compared with matched non-users (4.6% vs. 2.7%, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There was a similar result (82% higher) when researchers analyzed people who had at least 2 melatonin prescriptions filled at least 90 days apart. (Melatonin is only available by prescription in the United Kingdom.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A secondary analysis found:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants taking melatonin were nearly 3.5 times as likely to be hospitalized for heart failure when compared to those not taking melatonin (19.0% vs. 6.6%, respectively).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants in the melatonin group were nearly twice as likely to die from any cause than those in the non-melatonin group (7.8% vs. 4.3%, respectively) over the 5-year period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Melatonin supplements are widely thought of as a safe and 'natural' option to support better sleep, so it was striking to see such consistent and significant increases in serious health outcomes, even after balancing for many other risk factors," Nnadi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I'm surprised that physicians would prescribe melatonin for insomnia and have patients use it for more than 365 days, since melatonin, at least in the U.S., is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia. In the U.S., melatonin can be taken as an over-the-counter supplement and people should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication," said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, Ph.D., C.C.S.H., FAHA, chair of the writing group for the American Heart Association's 2025 scientific statement, Multidimensional Sleep Health: Definitions and Implications for Cardiometabolic Health. St-Onge, who was not involved in this study, is a professor of nutritional medicine in the division of general medicine and director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research in the department of medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. First, the database includes countries that require a prescription for melatonin (such as the United Kingdom) and countries that don't (such as the United States), and patient locations were not part of the de-identified data available to the researchers. Since melatonin use in the study was based only on those identified from medication entries in the electronic health record, everyone taking it as an over-the-counter supplement in the U.S. or other countries that don't require a prescription would have been in the non-melatonin group; therefore, the analyses may not accurately reflect this. Hospitalization figures were also higher than those for initial diagnosis of heart failure because a range of related diagnostic codes may be entered for the hospitalization, and they may not always include the code for a new diagnosis of heart failure. The researchers also lacked information on the severity of insomnia and the presence of other psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Worse insomnia, depression/anxiety or the use of other sleep-enhancing medicines might be linked to both melatonin use and heart risk," Nnadi said. "Also, while the association we found raises safety concerns about the widely used supplement, our study cannot prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship. This means more research is needed to test melatonin's safety for the heart."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study details, background and design:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The study included 130,828 adults (average age of 55.7 years; 61.4% women) diagnosed with insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The study data was from TriNetX, established in 2013, a growing global network of real-world, de-identified patient data available for research.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;65,414 participants had been prescribed melatonin at least once and reported taking it for at least a year.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A second group of people were examined for comparison (control group) - those who had never been prescribed melatonin and were matched to the group taking melatonin on 40 factors including demographic information, health conditions and medications. &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants were excluded if they had already been diagnosed with heart failure or had been prescribed other types of sleeping pills such as benzodiazepines.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The melatonin and control groups were matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, heart and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-is-the-Nervous-System.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt; diseases, medications for heart and nervous system diseases, blood pressure and body mass index. Researchers looked at electronic medical records from the five years after the matching date.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For the main findings, records were searched for codes related to an initial diagnosis of heart failure. Secondary findings included codes for hospitalization related to heart failure or death.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Following the initial analyses, researchers validated the credibility of their findings by conducting a sensitivity analysis. This involved slightly changing the criteria: they required participants in the melatonin group to have filled at least two melatonin prescriptions that were at least 90 days apart. This adjustment aimed to determine whether the extended duration of confirmed melatonin prescriptions influenced the outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17963-6" target="_blank"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests a profound link between how we perceive our bodies and our ability to recall events from our personal history. This finding is the first to show that temporarily changing one’s sense of bodily self can facilitate the retrieval of remote memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation was led by a team of neuroscientists at Anglia Ruskin University who were exploring the connection between the self, the body, and autobiographical memory. Our memories are not just recordings of external events; they are experiences that happened to us while we inhabited a particular body. The researchers reasoned that since our bodies change throughout our lives, the physical self we had in childhood is different from the one we have as adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When our childhood memories were formed, we had a different body,” said senior author Jane Aspell, who leads the Self &amp;amp; Body Lab at Anglia Ruskin University. “So we wondered: if we could help people experience aspects of that body again, could we help them recall their memories from that time?” This question formed the basis for their experiment, which sought to see if reintroducing body-related cues from the past could help reactivate memories associated with that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this idea, the researchers recruited 50 healthy adults for an online experiment. Participants were randomly split into two groups. In the experimental group, individuals viewed a live video of their own face that had been digitally altered with a filter to look like a childlike version of themselves. The control group viewed a live, unaltered video of their adult faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then induced what is known as an “enfacement illusion.” Participants were instructed to move their heads in time with a metronome. For both groups, the face on the screen would mirror their movements, creating a powerful sensation that the face they were seeing was their own, similar to looking in a mirror. This synchronous movement was designed to create a strong feeling of ownership over the on-screen face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the strength of the illusion, the experiment also included a condition with asynchronous movement. In this part, the face on the screen moved in the opposite direction to the participant’s head movements, which tends to weaken the feeling of ownership. After each session of head movements, participants answered a questionnaire to measure how strongly they felt that the face on the screen was their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately following the illusion, participants engaged in an autobiographical memory interview. While still viewing either their childlike or adult face, they were asked to recall specific events from two different time periods: their childhood (up to age 11) and the past year. The researchers provided cues like “home” or “holiday” to prompt the memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s primary interest was not just whether people could remember events, but the richness of those memories. The interviews were recorded and scored based on the level of detail provided. Specifically, the researchers distinguished between two types of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is semantic memory, which involves factual information, like the name of a place you visited. The other is episodic memory, which involves the ability to mentally re-experience an event, recalling sensory details, emotions, and the feeling of being there. This is often described as a form of mental “time travel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear difference between the two groups. Participants who experienced the illusion with their childlike face recalled significantly more episodic details about their childhood memories compared to the control group who saw their adult faces. This effect was specific to childhood memories; the illusion had no impact on the recall of recent events from the past year. It also did not affect the recall of semantic, or factual, details about childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Utkarsh Gupta, who conducted the study as part of his PhD, explained the potential mechanism behind the results. “All the events that we remember are not just experiences of the external world, but are also experiences of our body, which is always present,” he said. “We discovered that temporary changes to the bodily self, specifically, embodying a childlike version of one’s own face, can significantly enhance access to childhood memories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, “This might be because the brain encodes bodily information as part of the details of an event. Reintroducing similar bodily cues may help us retrieve those memories, even decades later.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted some limitations and areas for future exploration. The strength of the illusion, whether induced by synchronous or asynchronous movement, did not appear to affect the amount of memory detail recalled. This may suggest that simply viewing and identifying with the childlike face was enough to trigger the memory enhancement, a phenomenon that could be related to priming. Future studies could directly compare the embodiment illusion with a simpler priming condition, such as just looking at a static picture of a young face, to separate these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation was that the digital filter was a generic approximation of a younger face, not a personalized rendering based on participants’ actual childhood photos. Future experiments in a lab setting could use more advanced technology to create more realistic and personalized younger selves, possibly strengthening the effect. Researchers also suggest that modifying the protocol to administer the illusion questionnaire after the memory interview could help avoid biasing participants’ responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the findings open up new possibilities for understanding memory. They suggest that the self is not a single, static entity but is fluid, and that our memories are deeply intertwined with our physical form at the time they were made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results are really exciting and suggest that further, more sophisticated body illusions could be used to unlock memories from different stages of our lives – perhaps even from early infancy,” said Aspell. She suggested that in the future, it might be possible to adapt these techniques “to create interventions that might aid memory recall in people with memory impairments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-17963-6" target="_blank"&gt;Illusory ownership of one’s younger face facilitates access to childhood episodic autobiographical memories&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Utkarsh Gupta, Peter Bright, Waheeb Zafar, Pilar Recarte-Perez, Alex Clarke, and Jane E. Aspell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 11:05:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPT2x2M0R4SUg4a3ozVHlja3FEeE90ZndDdWFGc2tzUjZhbmdjUUcxT1U2SkhBWmtmWkxSX3ViQTNSY2UwblF4TUhJODRQb0ZFVkp3cTJCZ2RWUGJ1SmhuanRtSUl6N3ExWVJmVGwtVTNIOVRDNmFJenJDaDcwZ2J4RTc5UnZCSXU2OHU5OXg1ckQwVjM0N195UVZFSDJnUFYzamJHWmxwMWJOOXNPU204OHQ0RzQ</guid></item><item><title>科学让花生过敏全错了–直到科学方法正确- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/03/health/peanut-allergy-researcher</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0003356nzti48g0s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was a question Dr. Gideon Lack asked often, when giving lectures to fellow allergists and pediatricians on the topic of food allergies: How many doctors in the room had a patient allergic to peanuts?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0004356nrwj3r31f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Normally, “virtually every doctor would have put up their hand,” Lack said. Peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies, affecting more than 2% of US children, with a similar &lt;a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/resources/peanut-allergy-factsheet/" target="_blank"&gt;prevalence&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom, where Lack was practicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0005356nbenw5p9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But at a lecture in Tel Aviv, Israel, about 25 years ago, the audience’s response took Lack by surprise. Only two or three out of about 200 raised their hand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0006356nz8q0prs0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I said, ‘Wait, this doesn’t make sense,’ ” he recalled recently. “I was practicing in London, which has a big Jewish community, and I was seeing a high frequency of peanut allergy amongst Jewish children who share similar ancestral background.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0007356n0i6tol41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack and his colleagues’ investigations into why, which played out over the next 15 years, led to last month’s remarkable &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/20/health/peanut-allergy-guidance-change-wellness"&gt;finding&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of peanut allergies in the US – after a precipitous rise – appeared to have fallen dramatically.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0008356nxbol2yoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It turned out that the guidance parents and pediatricians – and Lack himself – had been following, to avoid giving peanuts to babies and young children to try to prevent the development of dangerous allergies, was completely backward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0009356nbecgiuzw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By thinking we were protecting them, we were actually causing the problem,” Lack told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000a356nup77hdz5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The story of how he and his colleagues proved that was the case is a primer in the &lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/explore/videos/the-scientific-process" target="_blank"&gt;scientific process&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000c356nehco6urw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a joke in Israel that the first three words babies learn are “mother,” “father” and “Bamba,” Lack said – for the peanut puff snacks that Israeli parents give babies when they’re very young.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000d356n2m8tlcn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’ve sort of become a national snack,” he noted, pointing out that the joke is actually “a truism.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000e356nn1bx6z2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As he had conversations with the doctors there, as well as parents of young children, “They all told me one very clear thing: ‘We give peanut snacks to our babies from between 4 and 6 months of age.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000f356nl23044wu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bambas contain “vast amounts of peanut protein,” Lack said. And he came to suspect that, just by “happenstance … this product was developed in Israel and protected the Israeli population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000g356n0l3c1h2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that was an observation, something he’d learned at a lecture, Lack emphasized. “That’s not really proof of anything.” Could there be other differences Israeli children experience - weather, sunshine, vitamin D exposure - that could have contributed?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000h356ncm7bqm4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So he and a team of colleagues set out to study it. They looked at about 5,000 schoolchildren in Israel and 5,000 Jewish schoolchildren in London who shared a similar ancestral background – to control for genetic differences – and compared their rates of peanut allergy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000i356n4chbnj5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the UK, it was tenfold higher”: almost 2% of kids, Lack said, whereas in Israel, it “virtually didn’t exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000j356naz22rqr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Examining the children’s diets, including when peanuts were introduced in the first year of life, revealed an obvious difference: UK babies were consuming a median zero grams of peanut per week. Israeli babies were eating about 2 grams – equivalent, in Bambas form, to about 10 weekly peanuts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000k356nle88cvc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The kids were eating this with great relish,” Lack noted; it’s a “very popular snack.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000l356nyammts9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “at the time when I suggested this hypothesis, it was virtually impossible to get funding,” he said. He and his team turned to the &lt;a href="https://nationalpeanutboard.org/" target="_blank"&gt;National Peanut Board&lt;/a&gt;, the group representing American peanut farmers. He said the study was criticized for who funded it but emphasized that it had no bearing on the outcome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000m356ndhlnsp6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The idea of eating peanuts was felt to be preposterous, that we would be putting babies at risk and causing peanut allergy based on the old thinking we had, and that it would even be an unethical thing to do,” he recalled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000n356nbjh8egus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The results suggested otherwise. But&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the work was only beginning.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000p356nj098zwo9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What Lack and his colleagues had shown with that study, which was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19000582/" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in 2008, was an &lt;em&gt;association &lt;/em&gt;between eating peanuts early in infancy and a lower likelihood of developing peanut allergy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000q356nkwm14gk2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What they wanted to prove was that early introduction of peanuts was the &lt;em&gt;cause &lt;/em&gt;of those reduced allergy rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000r356nj6jzhklq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For that, they’d need to run a randomized controlled trial, in which they randomly separated participants – in this case, infants with severe eczema, egg allergy or both, putting them at higher risk of peanut allergy – into two groups. One set was directed to consume foods with peanut - such as Bambas peanut puffs - starting between 4 and 11 months of age, and the other was told to avoid them until they turned 5 years old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000s356nft4nkr3w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This time, Lack and his colleagues received funding from the US National Institutes of Health, specifically the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Lack called “patient and generous.” It was not an overnight result. It took two years to recruit the 640 infants into the trial, Lack said, and then they were followed for five years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000t356nurmayp96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The results were stark. Of the 530 kids who didn’t start out with a sensitivity to peanut, 13.7% developed peanut allergy by age 5 if they avoided peanuts. In the group that consumed peanuts starting before age 1, 1.9% developed peanut allergy. Among kids who’d shown signs of sensitivity to start with, 35.3% who avoided peanuts developed the allergy, versus 10.6% of those who ate them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000u356nitg99pjk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was hoping for an effect, but I was not expecting to see a more than 80% reduction,” Lack said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000v356njoh2j59c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the biostatisticians called him and colleague Dr. George Du Toit with the results, “we toasted the good news to whiskey and roasted peanuts,” Lack recalled. They published the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850" target="_blank"&gt;findings &lt;/a&gt;from the trial, called the LEAP study, in 2015 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000x356nmgxc59af@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It wasn’t clear, though, whether the message would resonate with parents and pediatricians – if they could change course and do the opposite of what they’d been told for so long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000y356n3lfz2iu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10920165/" target="_blank"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; had been issued in 2000 by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and although they’re often described now without nuance, they were anything but definitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd000z356npbcbd90q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Conclusive studies are not yet available to permit definitive recommendations,” the academy’s Committee on Nutrition wrote in a document about hypoallergenic infant formulas. For infants at high risk of developing allergies, the committee continued, “the following recommendations seem reasonable at this time” – including delaying introduction of dairy products until 1 year, eggs until 2 years and peanuts, nuts and fish until age 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0010356nwt58cge3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack himself followed the avoidance guidance with his own sons, which of course, “in retrospect, was the wrong advice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0011356nc95eahk0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he emphasizes that the scientific process of proving it was the way medicine should work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0012356nlo1xv0p4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The history of medicine is a series of zigzags,” he said. “It’s not one linear, perfect progression, and people forget that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0013356n0kjzok2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6157280/#:~:text=In%202008%2C%20the%20AAP%20partially,for%20introducing%20peanut%2Dcontaining%20foods." target="_blank"&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; its guidance that said potential allergens should be avoided for high-risk babies, but didn’t have enough data to recommend introducing them early.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhf734ly0001356nf3pzsyow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the LEAP study was published in 2015, the guidance was updated in what researchers now refer to as a landmark move, and the recommendations were expanded in 2017 and 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0014356nmk27clxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal Pediatrics found that rates of peanut allergies among US kids 3 and under declined 33% after the 2015 recommendation and fell 43% after 2017 – and peanut allergies slipped from being the most prevalent to the second-most, behind eggs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0015356n2yy7pubv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Study leader Dr. David Hill of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia notes that those reductions, extrapolated to the number of US kids under age 3, suggest that almost 40,000 children may have avoided peanut allergy diagnoses since the guidelines changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Lack’s work continues. He’s currently co-leading another trial funded by the NIH, called the &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/10825608" target="_blank"&gt;SEAL study&lt;/a&gt;. It seeks to test another question that once seemed backward: Could treating eczema early in a baby’s life prevent the development of food allergies?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0018356n75arbqh0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For years, we used to think that food allergies cause eczema,” Lack said. “Now we know it’s the reverse.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd0019356nfkjih8ij@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea is referred to as the dual-exposure hypothesis, and Hill noted that it’s supported by decades of research, including from the LEAP trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001a356np9v7aguy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Early exposure to food proteins through the gut promotes tolerance, teaching the immune system that these foods are safe,” he told CNN. “In contrast, exposure through inflamed or disrupted skin – as often occurs in infants with eczema – can sensitize the immune system and increase the likelihood of developing food allergy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001b356n6pxmqr5c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies might encounter food proteins through their skin if they have eczema just from their parents eating those foods, Lack said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001c356n8477qzys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He put the hypothesis another way: “If I were to knock on your front door and ask for directions, you’d probably greet me in a civil way. But if I were to break into one of the windows, you might greet me in a different way.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhe1f4sd001d356nsqyrqben@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The SEAL study aims to &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03742414" target="_blank"&gt;treat &lt;/a&gt;dry or red, flaky skin in the first 12 weeks of life, before babies have developed allergies, using moisturizers and topical steroids, and give babies more time to be exposed to foods by eating them. The goal: see if that helps reduce the likelihood they develop food allergies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If they’re right, it could change medicine again.

During deep rest, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulates through brain tissue, clearing away waste and restoring balance in neural communication. When this cycle is disrupted, the effects reach far beyond fatigue, influencing memory, focus, and emotional stability. In recent years, scientists have turned their attention to how this cleansing process is controlled and what happens when it falters. Understanding how sleep loss alters CSF movement reveals not only why mental clarity suffers after sleepless nights but also how long-term deprivation may affect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does your brain do when you sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every night, while the body appears still, the brain becomes remarkably active in maintenance. CSF, a clear liquid that cushions and nourishes the brain and spinal cord, pulses through networks of neural tissue. Its main role is to remove metabolic waste such as beta-amyloid and tau proteins, which accumulate during wakefulness. These same proteins are linked to neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease, making efficient CSF circulation essential for long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Impact of Sleep on Brain Function and Mental Well-being&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During sleep, particularly in slow-wave phases, the brain’s electrical activity changes rhythmically. Neuronal firing slows, blood flow patterns shift, and the spaces between brain cells expand, allowing CSF to flow more freely. This combination of slowed activity and increased fluid movement acts as the brain’s own detoxification system. When this process is interrupted, the brain’s ability to regulate toxins and maintain functional balance becomes impaired, a disruption that researchers increasingly connect to cognitive and emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does lack to sleep harm your brain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02098-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;recent study published in Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; used advanced imaging and electrophysiological measurements to explore how sleep deprivation affects the coupling between brain activity and CSF flow. Researchers monitored participants who underwent controlled sleep loss, measuring changes in neural oscillations, blood oxygenation, and CSF movement during subsequent rest periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings revealed a striking pattern: after extended wakefulness, the natural synchronisation between brain activity and fluid circulation weakened noticeably. Under normal conditions, waves of neural activity guide CSF pulses through the brain’s ventricles in a tightly coordinated rhythm. However, when subjects were sleep-deprived, this rhythm broke down, leading to slower, less effective fluid movement. The study also recorded increased variability in blood flow across regions responsible for attention and executive function, suggesting that the consequences of disrupted CSF dynamics extend into areas governing higher-order cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that this decoupling coincided with measurable declines in reaction speed and working memory performance. Even short-term sleep loss, they noted, can reduce the brain’s metabolic clearance efficiency. These findings shed light on why lack of sleep so quickly affects focus, reasoning, and emotional control; it is not only about fatigue but also about an internal breakdown in the brain’s waste management and communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When does the brain falls out of sync&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation affects more than just the physical movement of CSF. It disrupts the delicate timing between electrical and vascular activity that keeps the brain’s systems in sync. Normally, waves of low-frequency oscillations act as signals that coordinate blood and CSF flow. When these oscillations lose their rhythm, neural communication becomes noisy and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In imaging data, this manifests as diminished coupling between deep and superficial brain regions, particularly within the prefrontal cortex—the area responsible for decision-making and attention control. The disrupted synchrony means that messages between networks arrive either too early or too late, reducing overall cognitive precision. People who have gone without sleep often experience this as “mental fog” or difficulty maintaining focus, but the physiological cause lies in impaired timing between neurons and supporting fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same study found that even after a recovery night of rest, the brain’s coordination of fluid and electrical rhythms did not fully return to normal, indicating that the effects of acute deprivation can linger. This persistence suggests that the brain requires more than one night of quality sleep to fully recalibrate its internal systems after extended wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is proper sleep essential&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sleep and brain health extends well beyond temporary tiredness. Persistent deprivation weakens the brain’s ability to clear neurotoxic waste, allowing harmful proteins to accumulate over time. Research into neurodegenerative diseases increasingly points to chronic sleep disruption as a contributing factor in cognitive decline. While the Nature Neuroscience study focused on short-term effects, its findings align with broader evidence linking reduced CSF circulation to long-term structural changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prefrontal and parietal regions, which are most sensitive to sleep loss, also play critical roles in emotional regulation and memory consolidation. When their function is compromised, individuals may experience heightened stress reactivity, impulsivity, and forgetfulness. Moreover, impaired fluid movement may affect not only toxin clearance but also the distribution of nutrients and hormones critical for neural repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding this connection has significant implications for public health. As modern lifestyles increasingly compress sleep schedules, disruptions in CSF dynamics may become more common. The findings emphasise that consistent, high-quality sleep is not simply a matter of rest but a biological necessity for maintaining the brain’s internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spilled your coffee while rushing out the door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You struggled to change a setting on your phone, only to give up in frustration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You got a bug bite, or sunburn, or stubbed your toe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You had to stand in a long line or wait in traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone spoke (or chewed gum, or slammed a door) too loudly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone interrupted or ignored you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not the kind of events that disrupt the course of your life. But they are all annoying, and sometimes bothersome enough that they could set the tone for the rest of your day. Annoying experiences like these have also been &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00844845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt; ‘micro-stresses’ or ‘daily hassles’. They usually come your way unexpectedly, cause you some stress, and interrupt your flow. Though they are minor compared with, say, a personal attack, an injury or a significant loss, I’ve seen in my work as a psychologist how often people struggle to tolerate annoying things or underestimate their impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite likely that you’ve been told ‘don’t sweat the small stuff’ and ‘focus on the bigger picture’. Despite our best efforts, though, many of us sometimes find it hard to shrug off the lingering emotional effect of an annoying experience. Making it worse, you might judge yourself for not being able to just let it go. Even if a particular stressor seems insignificant on its own, annoying experiences can have a cumulative effect. Like drops filling a bucket, they can eventually spill over until you’re suddenly snapping at someone, or &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;tearing up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that accumulated stressors might take a toll in other ways too. For example, a study in the 1980s &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.3.486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people who experience more daily hassles report greater fatigue, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More recently, researchers have &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00684-004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that increased stress and hassles significantly predicted the consumption of high-fat and high-sugar snack foods, with implications for physical health. And clinical researchers &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-017-1436-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that people who reported high levels of daily hassles were significantly more likely to develop generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder or panic disorder over a follow-up period of several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoying experiences are a normal, inevitable part of life. So, whether you’re concerned about their cumulative impact on your wellbeing or just want to reduce the frustration you feel in the moment, there is value in learning to handle annoying things better. This is where evidence-based psychological skills are handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/how-to-live-a-values-driven-life-in-the-face-of-dark-emotions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;acceptance and commitment therapy&lt;/a&gt; (ACT), there’s an important distinction between &lt;em&gt;unavoidable pain&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;avoidable pain&lt;/em&gt;. Micro-stressors such as running late, spilling something on your shirt or receiving a curt text message represent the unavoidable pain that comes with being human. Daily hassles happen. But how you choose to respond to those moments determines whether you add to the stress. Skills grounded in ACT – which I’ll draw from in the rest of this Guide – can help you reduce the avoidable pain that often comes with aversive experiences, including common annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301940?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that ACT can be effective in managing various forms of psychological distress, including those stemming from daily hassles. I’ve seen this happen in my own therapy practice. One client, for example, used to become agitated by his neighbour’s dog barking at random hours of the day and night. Despite his attempt to address the problem by talking to his neighbour, the dog wasn’t going anywhere, and neither was his frustration. Over time and with practice, though, he began to approach the barking with a kind of detachment. The dog didn’t stop barking, but what changed was his ability to pause, notice his frustration, and apply coping skills of the sort I’ll be describing here. That made all the difference. With practice, you too can learn to relate to annoyances in a more skilful way, whatever your next ‘barking dog’ &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;might be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Embrace ‘radical acceptance’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s natural to want to fix or undo the annoyances you encounter. But insisting that a frustrating experience shouldn’t have happened doesn’t change that it did happen. What it does do is deepen your stress. It’s like tugging on a locked door: tiring and ineffective. That’s why you need &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-enjoy-your-problems-and-reach-enlightenment" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;radical acceptance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="ld-newsletter-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life’s little stressors can feel like a series of tiny battles. If you get lost in knee-jerk responses such as wishful thinking (&lt;em&gt;I wish this weren’t happening&lt;/em&gt;), rumination (&lt;em&gt;Why did that happen?&lt;/em&gt;), self-blame (&lt;em&gt;Why am I so careless?&lt;/em&gt;), or blaming others (&lt;em&gt;They ruined my day&lt;/em&gt;), it keeps you stuck in your head, takes you away from the present, and prolongs your unpleasant emotions. Instead of just feeling irritated about a lost key or a rude comment, you end up dealing with extra mental fatigue, shame or resentment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radical acceptance means recognising the reality of what has occurred without resisting it. It doesn’t mean you approve of what’s happened. It simply means you’re no longer fighting something that can’t be changed. It is about laying down your weapons and saying to yourself: &lt;em&gt;This is happening. How can I work with it without getting lost in it?&lt;/em&gt; You’re choosing to no longer let it set the tone for &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;your day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few prompts you can use as gentle reminders to practise radical acceptance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how things have unfolded right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can’t go back and change what’s happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fighting what happened only fuels my pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I resist the past, I lose the present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now is the only moment I can shape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how radical acceptance looks in action: you lose your keys. Instead of spiralling into thoughts like &lt;em&gt;Why does this always happen?&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;This is just what I need right now&lt;/em&gt;, you pause and tell yourself something like: &lt;em&gt;This is not ideal. But I don’t want to get stuck on this right now. I’m going to take a breath and calmly retrace my steps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stop resisting reality, you give yourself room to move on with your day, not by denying the frustration, but by refusing to add &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Make room for your emotions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotions are like waves that rise, crest and gently fade away, often within minutes, especially when you give them the space to do so. Each emotion naturally urges you to respond. When you act based on these feelings, it’s called emotion-driven behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, small hassles can trigger big emotional reactions, leading you to quickly engage in emotion-driven behaviours. Have you ever watched someone cut in line at a store? Maybe you experienced a sudden rush of irritation and found yourself glaring at the person, mumbling your disapproval, or speaking curtly to a store employee who wasn’t even aware of the cutting. As natural as it is, automatically doing what a momentary emotion pushes you to do can sometimes take you further away from being the kind of person you want &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can do instead:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice your feelings: &lt;/strong&gt;emotions live in our bodies first. If you misplace something important, you might feel a knot in your stomach, or your heart racing. When that happens, ask yourself: what am I feeling and sensing right now? Simply noticing your feelings and sensations might seem like a passive response, but it is critical for minimising your entanglement with unpleasant mental content, and it can help you respond to stressors more thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name your feelings: &lt;/strong&gt;take your noticing one step further. You don’t need a poet’s vocabulary to name your feelings; a short and sweet label works.&lt;em&gt; I’m feeling frustrated.&lt;/em&gt; Or: &lt;em&gt;This is anxiety.&lt;/em&gt; You can even imagine that you’re introducing a friend to your feelings: &lt;em&gt;Meet my annoyance. It’s here because the line at the café is moving slower than a sloth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the workability of your response: &lt;/strong&gt;within the ACT model, ‘workable’ actions are the ones that are aligned with your personal values and goals. Basically,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the idea is that every behaviour takes you closer to or further away from the life you want to build for yourself. So, you must ask yourself whether doing what an emotion pushes you to do in the moment would get you closer to that or further from it. You might ask yourself, for example: &lt;em&gt;If I yell at this barista for getting my order wrong, does that help me live the way I want to live?&lt;/em&gt; Or: &lt;em&gt;If I fixate on this person’s annoying hiccups, will it serve me &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;later on?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workability is less about what works in a conventional or problem-solving sense, and more about what works for you in relation to your values. It is a question of inner alignment and direction. An impulsive response to feeling annoyed – such as cursing at someone, slamming a door, or texting a snarky message – might bring you temporary comfort, but it isn’t workable if it pulls you away from your values. (As I will describe below, you can also use your values, rather than just your momentary emotions, to guide more workable responses.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one more example to demonstrate all these ways of making room for emotions without letting them dictate your behaviour. Let’s say you’re stuck in traffic, and you feel the frustration building. You can first notice what you are feeling in your body. Then you can name the emotion(s) you are feeling (&lt;em&gt;I’m feeling annoyed, and also powerless&lt;/em&gt;). Finally, you can ask yourself about the workability of what you feel the urge to do: &lt;em&gt;Will honking randomly at other drivers help me be the person I want to be? &lt;/em&gt;You can make space for what you are feeling and still make a choice about what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Centre yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, even if you have applied the preceding skills, you might find yourself tense, restless or stirred up. Centring practices offer you a simple and powerful way to return to a place of steadiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60-second reset is a versatile skill to help you pause and ground yourself. It has multiple variations. I suggest you try out each of the suggestions below, practising one of them for 60 seconds when an annoying experience leaves you agitated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Feel your feet. &lt;/strong&gt;Bring your attention to the soles of your feet. Imagine roots anchoring you to the earth &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;beneath you.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Belly breathing.&lt;/strong&gt; Place a hand on your stomach, inhale deeply for a count of 4, hold for 2, and exhale slowly for a count of 6. Repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ground through touch. &lt;/strong&gt;Press your palms together firmly, or grip the edge of a table or chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sigh it out.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a long, audible exhale, like a balloon slowly deflating. Let your body soften with the breath. Breathe in and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quietly hum.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tense and release. &lt;/strong&gt;Clench your fists for 7 seconds, then let go for 14 seconds. Repeat a few times to release pent-up tension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that these centring activities aren’t just quick, temporary fixes. Each one helps activate your parasympathetic nervous system – the branch responsible for rest, relaxation and restoring calm. With regular practice, these exercises can help you gradually build your capacity to handle daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Commit to acting based on your values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values, in ACT, are &lt;em&gt;freely chosen qualities of being&lt;/em&gt; that reflect how you truly want to live and behave. Your values are your compass. You can think of them as verbs, as ongoing patterns of action. For example, you might recognise ‘being caring’ as one of your most important values. In day-to-day life, you could turn this into specific, values-based actions such as a weekly check-in with your neighbour or a phone call with your friend to see how they are doing. There are concrete steps you can take to put your value into practice; to actively live out your value, rather than just thinking &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="lg:-ml-[150px] font-body max-sm:my-12 sm:float-start sm:max-w-[370px] sm:pr-10 sm:pb-10 lg:pl-10 print:hidden [&amp;amp;_a]:no-underline [&amp;amp;_p]:m-0"

matter when you have annoying experiences because they give you a direction to move in. If you’re feeling irritated by an itchy bug bite after a hike that already wasn’t going the way you planned, you might call to mind your core values and remember that being patient with yourself is one of them. If you’re struggling with setting a ‘smart’ thermostat at home, you might remind yourself that you value being curious, and then decide to search for some pointers online (rather than giving up or slamming the wall in frustration). If you’re annoyed that someone isn’t listening to what you’re saying, you might recall that you value being compassionate, and then ask, respectfully, if they can give you their full attention. These would all be examples of ‘workable’ responses that help you be the kind of person you want &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;to be.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think for a moment of Elena. She’s working out of her office at home, midway through an important work assignment, when suddenly, outside her window, a parked delivery truck starts beeping loudly and won’t stop. She notices her heart beating faster and a rush of heat flushing her body. She acknowledges the stress to herself (&lt;em&gt;This is causing me stress right now&lt;/em&gt;). Although she has the urge to pound her fist on the desk and even shout at the delivery driver, she pauses instead and asks whether that would serve her. She realises she’s actually faced a few frustrations today, and she takes a minute to centre herself, using the ‘sigh it out’ exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also asks herself, what really matters right now? And, as she answers that question, Elena taps into her values of being compassionate and being flexible. Knowing the driver is just doing their job and will probably depart soon, she fetches her earbuds to help block out the distracting noise until it passes. She resumes her work, feeling like she’s already started to release the stress she was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the practices I’ve shared, I hope you’ll find that, as disruptive as little annoyances like these can be, they also present everyday opportunities to live in a way that’s more closely aligned with your values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;When are you extra-sensitive to annoyance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although hassles can arise at any time, you might find that certain contexts leave you feeling especially vulnerable to irritation. Perhaps it’s during your morning routine, or when there is an unexpected change of plans, or while you are preparing meals. Some physiological states, such as fatigue, overstimulation or a lack of sleep, can also be precipitants of annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming aware of your own ‘tender times’ or vulnerability factors can help you anticipate them so that you can respond more gently to annoying things when they pop up. This is why I often invite my therapy clients to get curious about these patterns as they happen. One client, for instance, realised that the middle of the day, when his energy was running low, tended to be his most reactive time. Another client noticed that his tender time was when he arrived home from work, emotionally exhausted after a long day of talking to people in distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See if you can recognise the contexts that seem most conducive to frustration for you. This is not about getting rid of frustration or irritability altogether during these times, or trying to control your daily hassles. It’s about entering these situations with an awareness of what makes them challenging – and remembering to practise the skills you’ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="subheading"&gt;Meeting annoyance with self-compassion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be less easily rattled by annoyances going forward, &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/self-compassion-is-not-self-indulgence-heres-how-to-try-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;practising self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; can also help. Self-compassion is treating yourself with kindness in difficult moments, staying present with what you’re feeling, and remembering that struggling is part of being human. It’s like talking to yourself the way you’d talk to a friend who’s having a rough day. People who &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-be-kinder-to-yourself-by-practising-self-compassion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;practise self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; tend to be more emotionally steady, bounce back faster, and worry less. The psychologist Mark Leary and his team &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-06231-009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that self-compassion acts like a shield, helping people handle little irritations without getting overwhelmed by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different ways to practise self-compassion, and you can choose the forms that feel right for you. There are longer, more formal exercises like loving-kindness meditations or journaling, for example. There are also brief and practical ways to bring self-compassion into your day; in my podcast, I &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/playing-it-safe/id1513662923?i=1000512408933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;refer&lt;/a&gt; to these practices as self-compassion on-the-go. To practise self-compassion anytime, anywhere – including when you’re dealing with everyday hassles – all you need to do is acknowledge how you feel and check what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you’re stuck in a slow-moving line, or you’re cooking dinner and your partner says something that rubs you the wrong way. After you first name what you feel, as I recommended earlier (eg, &lt;em&gt;This is frustrating&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;That comment really bugs me&lt;/em&gt;), you then ask yourself: &lt;em&gt;How can I respond to myself with kindness?&lt;/em&gt; You might also ask yourself what you need to hear at that moment, or what a kind friend would say to you. All it takes is a little willingness to be gentle with yourself, even if just for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content text-copy [&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-[1.5625rem] lg:[&amp;amp;_p.subheading_strong]:text-3xl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a doer, a striver, or a person who deeply cares about doing things the right way, check out my &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781003083153/acceptance-commitment-skills-perfectionism-high-achieving-behaviors-patricia-zurita-ona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Acceptance and Commitment Skills for Perfectionism and High-Achieving Behaviors&lt;/em&gt; (2021). It will help you to compassionately and skilfully manage the frustration that arrives when things don’t go as planned, when people behave in ways they shouldn’t, or when you make mistakes despite your best efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you someone who feels things intensely, and who sometimes acts too quickly? For you, annoyances might easily escalate into emotional storms. My &lt;a href="https://exislepublishing.com/product/escaping-the-emotional-roller-coaster-act-for-the-emotionally-sensitive/?srsltid=AfmBOooaHo5NCFCyCvsk_Dk34OjRfgj8JFju-MmYjFzuwFi3HjwgpPJ-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Escaping the Emotional Roller Coaster: ACT for the Emotionally Sensitive&lt;/em&gt; (2018) teaches evidence-based skills, drawn from acceptance and commitment therapy, to help you deal with overwhelming emotions without getting swept away by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about acceptance and commitment skills, particularly as they apply to anxiety-based struggles, you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.thisisdoctorz.com/playing-it-safe-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, Playing-it-safe.&lt;/p&gt;

(And no, it’s not “Golden” from &lt;em&gt;KPop Demon Hunters &lt;/em&gt;played for the 10,000th time, though that’s a close second.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s the humble peanut. Even if your child isn’t allergic to the nuts, past surveys have shown as &lt;a href="https://icer.org/assessment/peanut-allergy-2019/#:~:text=Peanut%20is%20a%20common%20childhood,though%20the%20rate%20is%20low."&gt;many as 4.5 percent of kids in the US are&lt;/a&gt;, which means consistently scouring lunchboxes and snack packs for even traces of peanuts. And for a long time, this problem was getting worse — the self-reported prevalence of peanut or tree nut allergies among children in the US &lt;a href="https://www.foodallergy.org/resources/facts-and-statistics"&gt;more than tripled&lt;/a&gt; between 1997 and 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So here’s a rare public health win you can feel at the playground: Researchers at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2024-070516/204636/Guidelines-for-Early-Food-Introduction-and"&gt;compared peanut and food allergies&lt;/a&gt; before pediatric guidelines about feeding changed in 2017 and after, and found that infants and toddlers are being diagnosed with far fewer food allergies now. Comparing pre-guideline rates with the post-2017 period, diagnoses of any food allergy were about 36 percent lower — driven largely by a roughly 43 percent drop in peanut allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The sharp reduction in peanut allergies doesn’t just make it easier for parents to pack lunches across the country. It represents “prevention of a potentially deadly, life-changing diagnosis,” Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/well/peanut-allergy-drop.html"&gt;told the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. And it happened because public health researchers looked hard at the science, realized what they were doing to prevent allergies wasn’t working — and changed tack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-changed-and-why-it-worked" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What changed — and why it worked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For years, &lt;a href="https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2023posts/to-feed-or-not-to-feed-food-allergy-prevention-in-infants.html"&gt;well-meaning medical advice&lt;/a&gt; told parents that the way to protect children from developing food allergies was to delay the introduction of allergenic foods. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) laid out the following timetable for parents: delay introduction of cow’s milk until an infant is 1 year old, eggs until 2 years old, and nuts and fish until age 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Infant immune and gut systems are still immature, so waiting until children were older and those systems had more fully developed to introduce potentially allergenic foods seemed to make sense, and the advice was widely adopted by parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But that reasoning began to unravel in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1414850"&gt;2015 with the LEAP trial&lt;/a&gt;, a gold-standard randomized trial that found that high-risk babies who started peanuts early and kept eating it through childhood had about an 80 percent lower risk of developing a peanut allergy by age 5, compared to those kept off the nuts. Follow-up work showed that protection persisted into adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The shift reveals &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9268235/#:~:text=At%20around%20six%20months%2C%20but,around%206%20months%20of%20age."&gt;the value of dual-exposure&lt;/a&gt;: Early oral exposure to allergenic proteins found in foods like peanuts trains the immune system to tolerate them, while exposure through inflamed skin — common in babies with eczema — primes sensitization. So the new guidelines pushed safe oral introduction in the first half-year in forms infants can handle, like thinned peanut butter or puffs as opposed to whole nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What followed was evidence-driven public health at its best. The data was strong enough to trigger a policy 180: A 2017 addendum to the guidelines urged parents to &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/addendum-peanut-allergy-prevention-guidelines.pdf"&gt;introduce peanuts between&lt;/a&gt; 4 and 6 months. A &lt;a href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(20)31211-3/abstract"&gt;2021 consensus document&lt;/a&gt; from allergists and immunologists went further, also recommending the introduction of egg and other allergens at the same age. It’s one of those rare times when the science was clear, the guidance became clear, and the desired outcomes followed, as the new study from CHOP demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-new-data-on-food-allergies" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new data on food allergies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The CHOP team mined AAP-affiliated electronic health records to compare results from before and after the updated guidelines. Peanut allergy diagnoses fell from 0.79 percent to 0.45 percent among infants and toddlers, while any IgE-mediated food allergy — an immune reaction to specific food proteins that triggers the release of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which is what drives allergy symptoms — fell from 1.46 percent to 0.93 percent. Notably, peanuts even dropped from the most common allergy culprit to number two, with egg moving to first — exactly what you’d expect given that the AAP’s intervention was initially peanut-specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The researchers &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/peanut-allergy-children-infants-anaphylaxis-9a6df6377a622d05e47c340c5a9cffc8"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; the shift has already prevented tens of thousands of cases — on the order of around 40,000 peanut allergies, and some 60,000 food allergies overall — since 2015. That’s a huge payoff for what boils down to something as simple and cheap as giving your 5-month-old the occasional peanut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And there are likely even more gains to be realized, because the adoption of the new allergy guidance has been real but incomplete: Only about 29 percent of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7364336/"&gt;pediatricians reported&lt;/a&gt; fully implementing the 2017 recommendations a couple of years in, with somewhat higher compliance from allergists. The fact we still saw such sharp declines in allergies suggests the effects could be even bigger as awareness spreads among doctors and parents alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Peanut allergies are no joke. They tend to persist for life, they &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-peanut-allergy-be-cured-in-children"&gt;drive a disproportionate share of all severe allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt;, and dealing with them reshapes daily life in everything from school parties to air travel. Preventing even a slice of new cases means fewer EpiPens in backpacks, fewer late-night ER runs, and less of the background anxiety that families of allergic kids know too well. And there’s a real economic dividend: Estimates put the annual US economic burden of &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/food-allergies-cost-us-25-billion-a-year/"&gt;childhood food allergies at around $25 billion&lt;/a&gt;, or around $4,000 per affected child per year. Prevent those allergies from ever developing in the first place, and you lighten that load for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But there’s a broader lesson for health here that goes well beyond allergies. When a large, decisive trial shows an actionable prevention behavior, change the guidance decisively, say it simply, and measure outcomes in the real world. Then close the implementation gap with better clinician prompts, clearer parent handouts, and practical tips for high-risk families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientific expertise is &lt;a href="/future-perfect/461506/make-america-healthy-again-robert-kennedy-vaccines-obesity"&gt;under threat as never before&lt;/a&gt; — and some of that criticism &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-miscalculations-of-covid-small-school-closures"&gt;is warranted&lt;/a&gt;. But If you’re looking for evidence that public health can change its mind in the face of countervailing evidence, here it is, delivered in baby-safe spoonfuls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter. &lt;a href="/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup"&gt;Sign up here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPcVhuY3dKaWxfcC1wRFp1MUduYVdXc2pvczRhbkFtMElJY0dWOVdkUko2bjJ4Tk5jOGRFQ2N3UkY3MW9SZThUcmxxQ1E2bzVpQkRKMVlyMkhXTEVtSGhpOFlEVTFGLWJZZ2lnZFEydkRLTHlnWXNqS0xsTmJ2NW5EMXkxbGhyZGlTRW5rVXk1YzFtNUpTNGlUblY4VTJNTmw4UkE</guid></item><item><title>马里兰州学校最新的病毒爆发是令人讨厌的，但很少是危险的-巴尔的摩旗帜</title><link>https://www.thebanner.com/community/public-health/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-schools-NU2AKZVUQVGO3FC5UNQBZBLNWU/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Itâ€™s that time of year when germs begin to make their way around classrooms. And one yucky, but not particularly dangerous, virus is making extra rounds in Maryland and much of the rest of the country: hand, foot and mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;In the state, there have been 276 outbreaks reported this year as of October 24, a big jump from&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;48 last year and 145 in 2023. There were just 74 in 2022, according to the Maryland Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The outbreaks â€” defined by three or more cases in a seven-day period â€” have been confirmed in day care facilities, schools, camps and other youth-oriented settings, though the disease isnâ€™t limited to just children, according to&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;state health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is usually caused by an enterovirus called coxsackievirus A16. Symptoms appear as tiny blisters inside the mouth and on the palms of hands and feet that emerge three to five days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;The disease spreads person-to-person, such as when children cough on each other or&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;play with the same toys after touching their mouths or noses. In addition to saliva, the fluid in blisters can also spread the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;While people are most contagious during during the time they feel ill with cold-like symptoms, the virus can spread for weeks. There is no specific treatment, and the disease usually resolves on its own in about seven to 10 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;In Montgomery County, there has been a considerable rise in cases, with 38 confirmed this year in schools and day care centers, more than four times the numbers for&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the same time last year, according to Dr. Nina Ashford, the countyâ€™s public health services chief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;â€œTo prevent the illness, adults and children should wash their hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom or changing a diaper,â€�&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Ashford said. â€œAvoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose and mouth. Additionally, disinfect surfaces such as countertops and toys.â€� &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Jon Gonella, a physician assistant specializing in emergency medicine and urgent care for MedStar Health, said in a statement that the illness typically spreads during the fall when children gather for school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-testid="text-container"&gt;Thatâ€™s also true for flu, RSV and COVID-19, though cases of those infections all remain low so far, according to a new &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/Pages/Respiratory-Virus-Surveillance.aspx" target="_self" rel="" title="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/Pages/Respiratory-Virus-Surveillance.aspx"&gt;state health dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.

Children may not want to eat because of mouth pain, so make sure they are hydrated.

But a need to take them on a regular basis to help with falling and staying asleep could be a signal that the body is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/beating-insomnia-lower-risk-heart-attack-rcna72016" target="_blank"&gt;experiencing cardiac issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b15016" class="body-graf"&gt;“Insomnia can increase blood pressure, stress hormones and inflammation,” said Dr. Ekenedilichukwu Nnadi, lead author of the new study and an internal medicine resident at SUNY Downstate/Kings County Primary Care in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0b648" class="body-graf"&gt;Nnadi and colleagues looked at five years of electronic health records from 130,828 adults, average age 56, finding that people who took melatonin regularly for at least a year were nearly twice as likely to develop heart failure compared to those who didn’t use the supplement, though the actual rates were relatively low: 4.6% of people in the melatonin group developed heart failure, compared to 2.7% among those who didn’t take melatonin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c0249d" class="body-graf"&gt;They were more than three times as likely to be hospitalized for the condition (19% versus 6.6%), and nearly twice as likely to die during the study period, compared to people who didn’t take melatonin regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7706af" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s unclear, however, whether the data captured outcomes of all people in the U.S. who take melatonin long term. Researchers identified people as chronic users of melatonin based on medical records only — that is, if they’d been prescribed the supplement. In the U.S., the supplement is available over the counter and isn’t often reflected in medical records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f47f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“I caution people against drawing concrete conclusions based on this study alone,” said Dr. Nishant Shah, a preventive cardiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved with the study. “But now that we have this observation, this is prime time to figure out whether there’s actually a direct association of harm with sleep agents. That would be practice-changing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3e813e" class="body-graf"&gt;Nnadi’s research is scheduled to be presented in New Orleans at an upcoming meeting of the American Heart Association. It has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60e9c7" class="body-graf"&gt;Heart failure occurs when the heart can’t pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the body’s organs for them to function properly. Nearly 7 million Americans have the condition, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/heart-failure.html#" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-097025" class="body-graf"&gt;While the study found that long-term melatonin use was an indicator of potential heart problems — and not causing the problems itself — experts agreed more research is needed into the supplements’ possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8b9da" class="body-graf"&gt;“We have patients using all kinds of supplements without understanding the risks,” said Dr. Martha Gulati, a preventive cardiologist and the incoming director of the Davis Women’s Heart Center at Houston Methodist DeBakey Heart and Vascular Institute in Texas. “If there is harm from a supplement, it means the cost could be far more than simply expensive urine.” Gulati was not involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f35619" class="body-graf"&gt;Melatonin is a hormone made naturally by the body that helps regulate sleep and wake cycles. Synthetic versions, sold widely over the counter as dietary supplements, are marketed to help people &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/falling-asleep-time-may-safest-heart-new-study-shows-rcna4887" target="_blank"&gt;fall asleep faster&lt;/a&gt; or overcome jet lag. Because supplements aren’t regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, doses and purity can vary widely among brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-457ac4" class="body-graf"&gt;Use of the supplement has increased in recent years. A 2022 &lt;a href="http://sleepfoundation.org" target="_blank"&gt;Sleep Foundation survey&lt;/a&gt; found that up to 27% of U.S. adults take melatonin, as well as 4% of kids. The new study &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/reports-melatonin-poisoning-kids-increased-rcna31741" target="_blank"&gt;didn’t include children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c323a7" class="body-graf"&gt;People taking melatonin for sleep for more than a year should talk with their doctor, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d3cf" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“People should be aware that it should not be taken chronically without a proper indication,” Marie-Pierre St-Onge, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, said in a press release.

   &lt;p&gt;The return to "standard time" is better for our health according to sleep scientists, but the time change can be disruptive, and our bodies must also adjust to more hours of darkness as we head towards winter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The body is an exquisite time-keeping machine. And growing evidence shows that if you align your daily habits with&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/01/1261413416/how-to-optimize-your-circadian-rhythm" target="_blank"&gt; your circadian rhythms &lt;/a&gt;— including when you sleep, eat, and exercise — you can help fend off chronic disease and optimize good health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's start with a quick primer: "Your body is filled with clocks, explains &lt;a href="https://inside.salk.edu/fall-2018/emily-manoogian/" target="_blank"&gt;Emily Manoogian&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher and chronobiologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. In addition to the master clock in your brain, there are time-keeping mechanisms in every organ and in your cells.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Every cell in your body that has DNA has a molecular clock that keeps its own time," she says. They're all part of your body's circadian system helping you stay in sync with the 24-hour cycle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But our bodies don't keep perfect time on their own. Every day, we stray a bit from the 24-hour cycle, and need a reset, explains Salk Institute researcher &lt;a href="https://www.salk.edu/scientist/satchidananda-panda/" target="_blank"&gt;Satchin Panda&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;em&gt;The Circadian Code: Lose Weight, Supercharge Your Energy, and Transform Your Health from Morning to Midnight. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The master clock in your brain coordinates all the other clocks through a series of different cues," Manoogian explains, including external cues — such as light, food, and movement. And that's why the timing of our habits can play a pivotal role in keeping our clocks in sync.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Light from the sun serves as the external cue to resynchronize the master clock. That's why it's helpful to open the blinds in the morning and spend time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, it turns out, our first bite of food each day also works as an external cue to sync the clocks in our digestive system and throughout our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Food is also a signal to reset the clocks, especially your gut," Manoogian says. "That's one of the reasons why making sure you're eating at the right time relative to light is important."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Eating is a cue to wake up your digestive and metabolic organs, which are primed to function best during the day. By nighttime, the metabolic system is ready for rest, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you're asleep, your body expects to fast. And so it shuts down the part of the system that captures glucose from the blood and stores it away," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When people eat too close to bedtime or in the middle of the night, their metabolic organs aren't optimized to do their job. The misalignment can lead to poor blood sugar control. Her research shows that restricting the number of hours you eat during a day to about a 10 hour window, can lead to significant improvements in metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's lots of evidence that eating out of sync with your circadian rhythms can increase the risk of metabolic diseases, including diabetes and obesity. Studies show that shift workers who work rotating, overnight&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k4641" target="_blank"&gt; shifts have a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing these conditions due, in part, to the disruption of the natural rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And when it comes to exercise, some people find they do best in the morning, others in the afternoon, says&lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=13785" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Phyliss Zee&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. But the science shows exercising late at night, just before bed can disrupt sleep.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a peak time for almost every physiological process," Zee says. "The timing of feeding, the time that you exercise, the physical activity, all of these help entrain the clocks in your body so that they're in sync," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you eat dinner and go to bed around the same time most nights, your 'creature of habit' ways could pay off. "The science shows that regularity is very important for the circadian system and for health," Zee says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And while each person is unique she says,  a general rule of thumb is to begin limiting exposure to light, food and heavy exercise starting a few hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But as scientists have learned more about the importance of keeping our biological clocks in sync, society has moved in the opposite direction. Manoogian points to advertisements for midnight food menus, and around the clock work and entertainment as examples of our 24/7 modern life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One way to push back is to track your daily habits. Michelle Pittsley, who lives in Vista, Calif., started using an app called &lt;a href="https://www.mycircadianclock.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;myCircadianClock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to log her eating and blood sugar. She says it helped her stick to a "time-restricted eating" window and helped her track her progress. The app was developed by Salk scientists as a research tool, and is used in Salk Institute studies. It's free to any adult who downloads it. The app provides guidance on when to sleep, eat, and exercise. (Note: if you sign up, you're sharing data with researchers.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When we have "broken" circadian rhythms, the risk for chronic disease rises, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, gut diseases and common cancers, say Panda and Manoogian. If you want to be more intentional about aligning your habits for better health, here are three strategies to try.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Drop the late night snack, and limit the hours you eat.&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who restrict their eating to a ten hour window can reduce their risk of Type 2 diabetes, Manoogian says. She and Panda co-authored a study of 108 adults, average age 59, who had symptoms of metabolic disease. They found those who followed time-restricted eating saw a significant &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39348690/" target="_blank"&gt;reduction in their hemoglobin A1c&lt;/a&gt; (which is a person's average glucose level over a few months), compared to participants who did not restrict their eating window.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Participants were not asked to reduce calories, only to restrict the eating window for a period of three months.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was exciting to see that just the time restricted eating was able to reduce their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 60%," Manoogian says, because the reduction in blood sugar, if maintained, reduces the risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research also suggests that eating your biggest meal of the day in the afternoon, as opposed to later in the evening can be beneficial for those who want to lose weight. A study from Spain found &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/01/30/170591028/to-maximize-weight-loss-eat-early-in-the-day-not-late" target="_blank"&gt;early eaters lost 25 percent more weight&lt;/a&gt; than late eaters. Panda says when his mother gave up a late night snack that included tea with sugar and milk and an occasional snack, that one change led to a significant drop in her blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Go to bed about the same time most nights &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Keeping the same sleep schedule is optimal," Manoogian says. The consistency gives your body a chance to anticipate and keep internal clocks synchronized. During sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/06/26/g-s1-6177/brain-waste-removal-system-amyloid-alzheimer-toxins" target="_blank"&gt;waste is cleared out of our brains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sleeps-crucial-role-in-preserving-memory/" target="_blank"&gt;memories are consolidated&lt;/a&gt;, and there's a pile of evidence to show rest is critical for our health.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But don't beat yourself up when you have a late night out. And of course, there will be disruptions due to travel, work deadlines or weekend celebrations. "Going off your circadian system is not like breaking an arm," Manoogian says. Think of the harms of erratic schedules akin to the way dripping water can erode stone. "Little hits, time after time, can wear down the system," she says. And the result is you can feel slower and older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/20/705224709/dont-count-sheep-better-bedtime-rituals" target="_blank"&gt; lots of bedtime rituals&lt;/a&gt; to foster a good night's sleep, including limiting light before bed and sleeping in darkness. Zee's research shows &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/04/01/1089997121/light-disrupts-sleep#:~:text=Unlike%20those%20who%20spent%20both,night%20could%20disturb%20our%20metabolism" target="_blank"&gt;even small amounts of light&lt;/a&gt; while sleeping  can have adverse effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Time exercise to your 'sweet spot,' but not too late at night &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Whether you're a morning lark or a night owl can influence the ideal time for you to exercise, so this will vary from person to person, Zee says. "The better time to exercise depends, in part, on what we call your chronotype," she says, which is a person's innate preference for timing of sleep or when they feel more alert and energetic. One way to estimate your tendency is with a &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbti/assets/user-content/documents/Morningness-Eveningness%20Questionnaire.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Morningness-Eveningness&lt;/a&gt; questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're a morning person, then morning exercise can be beneficial," creating a consistent structure, Zee says, but people who grow more alert later in the day, may want to put it off until later. As people juggle competing obligations, exercise may be shoehorned into the time it fits on your calendar, even if it's not your body clock's preferred window. She says it's important to remember that exercise is beneficial, no matter what time you do it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But keep this in mind: "Exercise is a stimulatory cue to tell your body you should be awake," Manoogian says, so it's not a surprise that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58271-x" target="_blank"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that exercise just before sleep can &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-bed-linked-disrupted.html#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;disrupt sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNT3M3cFBnaFE2UkhBVUhmNFROV0xZTEZRajVEbzl3T1NDeUNsVXVaby1kYXhxX0ZPM3VxeHl5eVkwbzFGVjEzM05LWjJTbUk4WXF6NzMzU2ZXRTA1RGFpbktIT2R1b2dnWFNYbVpMWDZjUEl1Q2h6bDZWUGYxYXU2ZzVXNmFJQkxxWW16UHRkbnA</guid></item><item><title>以加拿大为首的美洲即将失去麻疹根除地位- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/03/measles-elimination-status-canada-united-states-mexico/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Americas — North, Central, and South — is the only region of the world that has ever managed to stop endemic transmission of measles. But that hard-won victory against the highly contagious virus is on the verge of being rolled back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week an expert committee of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is meeting in Mexico City to study measles transmission data from the region. Canada’s massive — by contemporary standards — and long-running measles outbreak is almost certain to trigger a finding that the country’s, and thus the entire region’s, status as having eliminated measles has been lost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though largely symbolic, losing measles elimination status will smart for the country, which had stopped ongoing measles transmission for more than a quarter century. Canada was declared measles free in 1998; the United States followed two years later, in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is perhaps a remote chance the committee — known as the regional verification commission for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome — will need additional data before reaching a conclusion. But two things are quite clear: The Canadian outbreak, though slowing dramatically, has not stopped, and the virus strain associated with this outbreak has now been transmitting in Canada for more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s still going on,” Natasha Crowcroft, Canada’s acting chief public health officer, told STAT in an interview last week. “We’re not surprised by that. It’s obviously disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Measles-free countries are always at risk of having the virus introduced from elsewhere, in a sick tourist or traveler; that alone does not lead to the loss of measles elimination status. But if such a spark ignites a chain of transmission that extends for 12 months, the virus is considered to be endemic, meaning the country is no longer deemed to be measles-free. Loss of measles elimination status in one country in a region results in the entire region losing elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniel Salas, executive manager of the special program for comprehensive immunization at PAHO, didn’t want to prejudge the commission’s deliberations. “We’re going to listen to what Canada is going to show, all the evidence, all the research that they have done, investigations of cases and all of that,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But experts who have been following the situation and understand the complexities of controlling measles outbreaks believe the writing is on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I would say elimination status for the region is probably at risk,” said Paul Rota, who retired as chief of the viral vaccine-preventable diseases branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in May, and who serves on the regional verification commission for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella for the World Health Organization’s Western Pacific region. (PAHO is one of the WHO’s six regional offices.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s my expectation of the outcome of that meeting, unfortunately,” Sarah Wilson, deputy chief of communicable diseases control at Public Health Ontario, told STAT. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, has recorded &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly 2,400 measles&lt;/a&gt; cases this year, all but 54 of which were part of the ongoing national outbreak. Ontario believes transmission there has stopped; its outbreak was declared over on Oct. 6.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Canada overall has recorded more than &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/#a21" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;5,100 confirmed and probable measles&lt;/a&gt; cases in 2025, and two deaths of babies born with congenital measles who were infected in utero. The country hasn’t seen this scale of measles transmission in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s tremendously disappointing,” said Lynora Saxinger, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Alberta. “I never in my life thought I’d see a massive measles outbreak in Canada. Most of my career in [infectious diseases], there’s been 10 cases a year or less.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outbreak began in October 2024, when someone infected abroad attended a wedding in New Brunswick, in eastern Canada. From there, the virus has spread across nine of Canada’s 10 provinces and to the Northwest Territories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saxinger is not alone in being surprised by the size of the outbreak, though details of where infections are happening help to put the number of cases and the vast geographic spread into context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like the measles outbreak earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/09/measles-america-breaks-33-year-record-anti-vaccine-sentiment-key-factor-behind-outbreaks/"&gt;in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, the lion’s share of the Canadian cases have occurred among members of close-knit religious communities that eschew contact with the wider world — homeschooling their children and seeking medical care only if it’s urgently needed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health officials have been hesitant to name the groups, for fear of further alienating them and undermining efforts to gain their help to control spread. But &lt;a href="https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/professionals-and-partners/resources/Documents/CMOH-Measles-Memorandum-to-PHU_2025-03-07_Signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a memo&lt;/a&gt; to Ontario medical officers of health last spring, the province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Kieran Moore reported that cases were being disproportionately seen in Mennonite, Amish, and other Anabaptist communities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this has been one of the challenges of this outbreak,” Wilson said. It’s been “a bit of a balancing act between communication about where the outbreak is occurring, the populations at risk, but balancing that with a very real risk of stigmatization of communities. And especially communities in which local public health units are really trying to … build and regain trust.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many members of these communities, which are found in pockets across the country, are under-vaccinated or unvaccinated. There had been no cases of measles reported within these communities in Ontario since before Canada achieved measles elimination status in 1998, Wilson said, meaning the pool of susceptible people was large and included adults as well as children. That has been evidenced by the fact that 51 of Ontario’s cases were in pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wilson said she’s seen some people try to characterize the outbreak as a post-Covid phenomenon — driven by the decline in uptake of vaccines for a variety of illnesses that multiple countries have reported in the wake of the pandemic. But she said in this case, the conditions were years in the making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It really predates Covid by not just many years [but] many decades when you look at the ages impacted,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rota agreed, noting the same is true of the West Texas outbreak, and a large outbreak in northern Mexico. All three of these outbreaks are believed to be linked. Combined, they have resulted in 28 measles deaths so far this year: 23 in Mexico, three in the United States, and two in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In some respect, the susceptibility that’s causing the outbreaks now has actually been there for a while, because these are really being fueled by these under-vaccinated populations,” he said. “They’ve been vulnerable for a while. And … the virus got there.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar outbreaks have occurred in the region in the past. In 2014, there was a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27705270/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;large outbreak&lt;/a&gt; among Amish communities in Ohio. An outbreak among orthodox Jewish communities in New York City and nearby counties that started in 2018 brought the United States &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/04/measles-outbreaks-put-u-s-at-risk-of-losing-prized-elimination-status/"&gt;perilously close&lt;/a&gt; to losing elimination status in the autumn of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Should the Americas lose measles elimination status as a result of this week’s meeting, it won’t be for the first time. The region was first declared measles free in 2016, but &lt;a href="https://journal.paho.org/en/articles/comprehensive-approach-achieving-reverification-measles-elimination-venezuela-2019-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a large outbreak in Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; erased that accomplishment in 2018. Brazil lost its elimination status the following year. Venezuela proved to the regional verification commission that it had stopped endemic spread in 2023. Brazil followed in 2024, allowing the Americas to again claim measles elimination status.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the current outbreak is extinguished in Canada, the country could regain its measles-free status if it can show the regional verification commission that it has gone 12 months without endemic transmission. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crowcroft, who is also the vice president for infectious diseases and vaccination programs at the Public Health Agency of Canada, thinks the end of the Canadian outbreak is in sight. “We’re pretty confident … we’re at the tail end of it.” But as a former member of PAHO’s regional verification commission, she knows that regaining elimination status isn’t a simple process. It’s not enough to claim that transmission has stopped. A country must show that its surveillance systems are robust enough to detect chains of transmission, if they are occurring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Asked if she’s worried about the message that could be sent because a country as affluent as Canada couldn’t stop transmission within a year, Crowcroft reframed the question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m more concerned … that we learn the lessons of this being a reflection of the global situation, and how much we do depend on each other,” she said. “Whether high income, low income, or middle income, wherever, we’re all dependent on each other to get ahead of measles.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Saxinger sees the milestone as a call to action. &lt;/p&gt;

That’s no longer the most dominant smell.

Half of adults smoked cigarettes in the 1970s, and since then, rates have plummeted. Vapes, on the other hand, are a relatively recent addition. You can see this in the chart below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Is this a positive development? Or are people just substituting one harmful habit with an equally harmful or even worse one?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;In this article, I address some of the most frequently asked questions about vaping and its effects. Are British smokers right? Is vaping actually more harmful than tobacco? Is there evidence for its effectiveness as a tool to quit? Could it be a “gateway” to smoking among young people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="what-are-the-health-risks-of-vaping-compared-to-cigarettes"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;What are the health risks of vaping compared to cigarettes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#what-are-the-health-risks-of-vaping-compared-to-cigarettes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;This is the crucial question. If vaping is just as bad as cigarettes, then substituting one for the other would not be positive for public health, or for individuals who smoke.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Research suggests that this is not the case. While we can’t say that vaping carries &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; risk, the evidence clearly indicates that it is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;much&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; less harmful than smoking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-block__pull-quote--left-center col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="left-center"&gt;Look at the news, and it’s easy to see why people would think that vaping is just as bad, if not worse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;This should not be surprising: tobacco is extremely bad for health.

This burning generates thousands of chemicals, some of which are toxic or carcinogenic. These include nicotine (which makes them addictive), tar, carbon monoxide, benzene, cadmium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (which are strong carcinogens), to name a few. Inhaling these substances is bad for the lungs, but as mentioned above, it can also damage other organs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Vaping is different. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;E-cigarettes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; heat a liquid, which creates an aerosol. This vapor is inhaled, but since no burning occurs — the liquid is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;heated,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; but there is no combustion — fewer toxins are released compared to smoking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;That doesn’t mean vaping is completely harmless, though. Many vapes contain nicotine, which makes them addictive. While nicotine is relatively benign for most people and has little long-term health impact, it can have short-term impacts on blood pressure and heart rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-6" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; It’s also not recommended for pregnant women, since there is some evidence that it can cross the placenta and affect fetal development — I say more on this in the additional information section below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Vapes also contain solvents and flavorings that can create harmful byproducts, and small amounts of metals can be released from the heating coil. Breathing in aerosols can irritate the lungs and exacerbate asthma or bronchitis. But overall, the health impacts are far lower than smoking tobacco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;People often note that we have less data on the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;long-term&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; health impacts of vaping. This is certainly true compared to cigarettes. However, vapes’ earliest adopters have been using them for two decades — they were first commercialized in the early 2000s. If there were significant long-term health impacts, we’d expect to see signs of those by now, especially if they were anywhere close to those of tobacco. And while we don’t have very long-term epidemiological data, we do have a good understanding of the ingredients, the levels of exposure, and how these are likely to affect the human body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Several additional health concerns are often raised; you might have seen them in media headlines. I review the evidence on these in the “detailed questions” section below.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;For those who don’t want to read through all of the details in my detailed FAQ below, the summary is quite simple: many health bodies suggest that vaping is much less harmful than tobacco. While they advise against it for young people or non-smokers, they do recommend it as a “quitting tool” for smokers for the health benefits of switching.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-7" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;I don’t think I can put it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chief-medical-officer-for-england-on-vaping" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;more succinctly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; than this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-block__blockquote col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;“The key points about vaping (e-cigarettes) can be easily summarised.

However, based on the research, vaping does appear to be an effective tool that helps people quit cigarettes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;What motivated me to write this research overview was the finding in the opening chart — that most smokers think vaping is equally or even more harmful. That misconception robs some people of the best option they might have to quit. I hope, then, that this article helps to close the gap in understanding and supports more smokers who want to stop but have struggled to do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="frequently-asked-questions-on-the-health-impacts-of-vaping"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Frequently asked questions on the health impacts of vaping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#frequently-asked-questions-on-the-health-impacts-of-vaping"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;details class="expander article-block__expander col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;summary class="expander__summary"&gt;&lt;span class="h4-semibold expander__title"&gt;Do vapes deliver more nicotine than cigarettes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="body-3-regular expander__subtitle"&gt;It’s often claimed that vaping is more addictive than smoking and delivers more nicotine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="plus" class="svg-inline--fa fa-plus expander__status-icon plus" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 448 512"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" d="M256 80c0-17.7-14.3-32-32-32s-32 14.3-32 32l0 144L48 224c-17.7 0-32 14.3-32 32s14.3 32 32 32l144 0 0 144c0 17.7 14.3 32 32 32s32-14.3 32-32l0-144 144 0c17.7 0 32-14.3 32-32s-14.3-32-32-32l-144 0 0-144z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="minus" class="svg-inline--fa fa-minus expander__status-icon minus" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 448 512"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" d="M432 256c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32L48 288c-17.7 0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32l352 0c17.7 0 32 14.3 32 32z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;div class="expander__content"&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;More specifically, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/technology/article/children-sold-vape-pens-powerful-50-cigarettes-rkgf2bvnp" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;common claim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; is that a single vape delivers as much nicotine as 50 cigarettes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Of course, it’s hard to know whether the comparison to 50 cigarettes is a lot, without knowing how long a single disposable vape might last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Let’s then compare typical nicotine absorption levels for vapers and smokers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;A typical packet of 20 cigarettes contains around 200 to 300 milligrams (mg) of nicotine (10 to 15 mg per cigarette). However, only a fraction of that is absorbed into the bloodstream (most is lost in smoke). That would mean 1 to 1.5 mg per cigarette, or 20 to 30 mg per pack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-8" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Vapes can contain different levels of nicotine.

The average daily cigarette consumption among smokers in Great Britain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/methodologies/adultsmokinghabitsintheukaveragecigaretteconsumptionmethodology" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;is around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; 10 to 11 per day.

Based on industry and seller estimates (which are obviously rough), this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ukvia.co.uk/how-long-does-a-vape-last" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;would last&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; one to two days for a moderate to average user: roughly equivalent to a 20-pack of cigarettes for the average smoker. Just like cigarette usage varies among smokers, so does how quickly a vape can last. Lighter vapers can use one for up to a week, giving them much less nicotine than the average smoker. Heavy vapers can consume a vape in less than a day, and will be taking in large amounts of nicotine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;If vapers are using e-cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine — which many do — then they are likely to be taking in slightly less nicotine than they’d get from cigarettes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-9" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that the nicotine exposure for the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;typical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; vaper is very similar to that of the average cigarette smoker, at least in countries like the UK.

That’s not surprising, and might be one of the reasons why they started vaping in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;But, if you ask smokers who do not currently vape — they either used to, or have never used them — they say the opposite: that e-cigarettes are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; harmful. This is shown in the two bars on the right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-block__pull-quote--left span-cols-14 grid grid-cols-12-full-width"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="left"&gt;E-cigarettes are the most effective quitting tool.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;These differences might partly explain why &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;smokers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; appear to be increasingly negative towards vapes, which we saw in the opening of this article. Those who smoked in 2015 and thought vapes would be effective ways to quit no longer smoke, and therefore weren’t surveyed as “current smokers” in 2025. That leaves those who have been more reluctant to use tools like vaping to quit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;This perception gap among current smokers matters. There is evidence that people’s perceptions of the health risks of vaping affect their willingness to switch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-22" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; For example, in a study of young adult smokers, those who knew vaping was less harmful were more likely to have made the switch from cigarettes to e-cigarettes at a follow-up six years later.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-23" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;When smokers are asked why they haven’t tried e-cigarettes, around one-third either say it’s because they are concerned that they’re not safe enough or don’t want to substitute one addiction for another. See the chart below, which shows the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; reason cigarette smokers give for not trying e-cigarettes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;An additional 13% are skeptical that vapes would help them quit or cut back on cigarettes. Indeed, e-cigarettes won’t work for anyone, but as we saw earlier, they are the most effective tool available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;That means around half of smokers who are unwilling to try e-cigarettes give reasons that are at odds with much of the scientific evidence and public health advice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="how-common-is-vaping-among-people-who-have-never-smoked"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;How common is vaping among people who have never smoked?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#how-common-is-vaping-among-people-who-have-never-smoked"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Tobacco smokers who switch to e-cigarettes might see large health benefits, but one concern is that many people who have never smoked take up vaping.

The chart below plots the share of people in each age group who vape in the UK. Nearly 30% of those aged 16–24 vape (not necessarily daily, but at least occasionally), compared to 14% of those in their late thirties or 10% in their late fifties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Let’s then go through the main concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;The first is that e-cigarettes are a “gateway” to tobacco. Teenagers start smoking vapes, then progress to cigarettes, which they get hooked on. Given the huge health risks of smoking, it would be extremely detrimental if vaping were a key driver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Those who argue that vaping &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; a gateway to tobacco often point to the fact that, at an individual level, young people who vape are more likely to go on to smoke than young people who don’t vape. This is true. A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.16773" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Cochrane Review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; — one of the detailed independent assessments I mentioned earlier — found evidence of this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-25" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; But, the review also makes clear that this does not mean they are causally linked; that vaping is necessarily what &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;caused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; them to start smoking. It could be the case that, for some underlying reason, young people who are more likely to start vaping are the same young people who are more likely to take up smoking. These young people who vape are possibly more prone to “risky” or addictive behaviors than those who don’t, and that likely makes them more open to smoking cigarettes, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;The Cochrane Review actually suggests the opposite, but with “very low certainty evidence”: that, at the population level, an increase in vaping rates is associated with a decline in smoking rates. The quality of existing research makes this difficult to say with confidence, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;However, we can also gain insight through population-level data on smoking rates. If vaping &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;were&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; a widespread reason for young people to start smoking tobacco, then we would expect to see more youngsters using cigarettes over time. Vaping rates have increased quite dramatically among young people, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/smoking" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;with almost 20%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; of 15-year-olds regularly using them, have reached a level where we would expect to see an effect in the smoking data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;In England, we don’t see such an effect: smoking rates &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/smoking-drinking-and-drug-use-among-young-people-in-england/2023" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;continue to fall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; (or hold constant at their lowest levels in decades). You can see this in the chart below. Only a few per cent of 15-year-olds smoke regularly, which is a huge drop from the 1980s, when it was over 20%. The share of pupils (aged 11 to 15) who have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;ever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; smoked has also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/smoking-drinking-and-drug-use-among-young-people-in-england/2023/part-1-smoking-prevalence-and-consumption" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;fallen dramatically&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;, from 50% to 12% since the 1990s. The same is true for other nations in Great Britain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="body-3-medium-italic article-block__aside article-block__aside--right col-start-11 span-cols-3 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;The number of cigarettes smoked per regular smoker has also continued to decline, from 39 in 2006 to 9. Smoking less still has many health benefits, even if people smoke regularly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;These trends are reflected in the United States, where smoking rates among young people have continued to fall, reaching a low of 1.7% high school students in 2024. As Jamie Hartmann-Boyce, assistant professor of health policy and management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-02-youth-vaping-future.html" class="span-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="article-block__blockquote col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;“The smoking rates among kids have declined steeply, and whether or not that's due to vaping or something else is up in the air. But it's difficult to argue that—in the U.S. population—youth vaping is en masse causing kids to smoke. The data doesn't support that so far.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Evidence from New Zealand is still contested, with some researchers suggesting that vaping is responsible for a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;slowdown in the decline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; of youth smoking rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-26" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt; Others dispute this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-27" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;27&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;To me, there is a clear argument to be made that e-cigarettes can positively impact many adults. In older populations, the majority of people who vape are ex- or current smokers; only a small percentage have never smoked. However, the net impact on teenagers is less clear to me. That’s because most of those who vape are teens who haven’t had time to become smokers. It’s hard, then, to know the counterfactual of how many would go on to smoke cigarettes if vapes didn’t exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;That leads to another concern: that a large population of young people is becoming addicted to nicotine through vaping. Many are those who would never have smoked in the pre-vaping era. I think this is broadly true. The significance of this problem depends on how harmful we think nicotine is on its own. It is far less dangerous than many of the other ingredients in cigarettes, but most health experts would argue that it isn’t risk-free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;That’s why public health advice almost always tries to strike a balance between recommending e-cigarettes as an effective tool to quit tobacco without encouraging vaping use among young people and non-smokers. The challenge for public communication is that emphasizing the small health risks of vaping for non-smokers or young people can make it seem particularly “unsafe” — or even more harmful than cigarettes — which isn’t true.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-block__subscribe-banner--center col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2 subscribe-banner subscribe-banner--center"&gt;&lt;div class="subscribe-banner__text"&gt;&lt;p class="subscribe-banner__p body-3-medium"&gt;We send two regular newsletters so you can stay up to date on our work and receive curated highlights from across Our World in Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="/subscribe" class="owid-btn owid-btn--solid-vermillion subscribe-banner__button"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Subscribe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="smoking-is-uniquely-bad-for-human-health-and-almost-anything-that-can-help-people-quit-will-improve-public-health"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;Smoking is uniquely bad for human health, and almost anything that can help people quit will improve public health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#smoking-is-uniquely-bad-for-human-health-and-almost-anything-that-can-help-people-quit-will-improve-public-health"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;I started this article with survey data; it showed that most British smokers think that vaping is more or equally harmful than cigarettes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;The evidence is clear that this is incorrect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span class=""&gt;A smoker who replaces cigarettes with e-cigarettes will reduce their health risks and potentially live a longer and healthier life.

In an Instagram video posted on November 4, the nutritionist explains how these ingredients help improve gut motility, promote regular digestion, and naturally ease digestive sluggishness.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Natural constipation relief combo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khushi’s go-to remedy for constipation features an all-natural mix of kiwis, chia seeds, and a hint of cinnamon. She highlights, “If you take kiwi, put a spoon of chia seeds on top, a pinch of cinnamon powder and have it daily for three days in a row, then I’m sorry my friend, you will have to say bye bye to your constipation, because this will heal you naturally.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nutritionist explains, “Together this trio hydrates your colon, feeds your gut bacteria, and improves &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/florida-gastroenterologist-reveals-why-your-gut-makes-noises-what-it-means-you-should-have-bowel-sounds-every-few-second-101762076767564.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="bowel "&gt;bowel &lt;/a&gt;regularity in a natural way to reset your digestion without laxatives!” She recommends having it every morning on an empty stomach for three consecutive days.

She explains, “&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/want-to-boost-immunity-try-these-5-kiwi-recipes-smoothie-bowl-slushie-and-more-101756355613665.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kiwi"&gt;Kiwi &lt;/a&gt;is rich in actinidin, a natural enzyme that helps break down protein and improves gut motility. Its insoluble fibre (from the skin) adds bulk to stool, while soluble fibre (from the pulp) softens the stool, making elimination easier and smoother, and hence curing constipation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are excellent for &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/physician-explains-link-between-gut-health-immunity-one-antibiotic-course-can-kill-30-to-50-percent-of-good-gut-bacteria-101761376816671.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="gut health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; as they’re rich in fibres which help improve gut microbiome diversity and promote healthy gut motility. The nutritionist elaborates, “Chia seeds absorb up to 10 times their weight in water, forming a gel-like texture that lubricates the gut and makes stool passage easy. They’re rich in omega-3s and prebiotic fibre which also help in improving good gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cinnamon powder&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Khushi, cinnamon is an anti-inflammatory powerhouse that not only boosts digestion but also supports healthy gut motility.

According to Dr Jayesh Sharma, Consultant Surgical Oncologist at ITSA Hospitals in Raipur, paying attention to small but persistent changes in the body can be life-saving. He explains that early detection plays a crucial role in preventing cancer-related deaths, especially in India, where cancers such as oral, cervical, and breast cancer are highly prevalent. Dr Sharma urges people to take routine screenings seriously and not to dismiss recurring symptoms. Detecting cancer in its earliest stages greatly improves treatment outcomes, making awareness and timely medical consultation essential for safeguarding long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="29123405" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="early-cancer-symptoms" source="keywords"&gt;Early cancer symptoms&lt;/keyword&gt; are often silent, warns Raipur oncologist &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sharma explains that cancer rarely starts with pain or severe symptoms. It usually begins subtly, with small and seemingly harmless signs that gradually progress. Many people ignore these early indicators because they assume they are caused by stress, infection, or normal ageing. However, such delays often allow the disease to advance undetected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He highlights that the key to survival lies in recognising these early changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cancers are curable if detected at an early stage,” says Dr Sharma. “Unfortunately, by the time people seek medical help, the disease has already progressed.” This is why awareness and regular check-ups are essential, especially for individuals with a family history of cancer or those exposed to known risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early signs of oral and cervical cancer for timely diagnosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important symptoms to watch for, according to Dr Sharma, is any swelling, sore, or ulcer inside the mouth that does not heal even after several weeks. This is particularly relevant in India, where oral cancer is one of the most common forms of the disease. Tobacco use, both smoked and chewed, remains a major contributor. “If a mouth ulcer or sore persists beyond two weeks, it is not a simple infection. It needs medical attention,” he advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He further points to abnormal bleeding as another crucial red flag. Bleeding without an obvious cause, such as coughing up blood, can sometimes indicate lung cancer. Similarly, bleeding between menstrual cycles or after menopause may suggest an underlying issue like cervical cancer. Dr Sharma urges people not to ignore these signs or self-diagnose. Instead, they should seek proper evaluation from a qualified healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Common cancers among Indian women&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, Dr Sharma highlights that cervical cancer continues to be the second most common cancer in India, followed closely by breast cancer. He explains that the earliest sign of cervical cancer is often unusual or persistent vaginal bleeding. “Women tend to normalise irregular bleeding, especially around menopause, but this can be dangerous,” he warns. “If the bleeding is inconsistent with your usual cycle or occurs after menopause, it requires immediate investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stresses that the goal is not to create panic but to encourage awareness. “Not every irregular symptom means cancer,” he says. “The important thing is to notice when symptoms persist or recur. If your body repeatedly shows the same problem, it is sending a message that something may be wrong.” Regular screenings such as Pap smears, mammograms, and HPV vaccinations can help detect or even prevent certain cancers before they develop into severe conditions. Dr Sharma recommends that women over 30 should schedule regular check-ups and discuss preventive tests with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recognising silent cancer symptoms before pain appears&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sharma emphasises that cancer does not begin with pain. Pain often appears in later stages, when the disease has already advanced. Instead, early symptoms can include persistent fatigue, unexplained weight loss, or changes in the skin and bodily functions. These small but recurring issues should never be brushed aside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explains that the body often gives subtle clues long before serious symptoms arise. Paying attention to these signs and consulting a doctor early can lead to faster diagnosis and better treatment outcomes. “When something doesn’t feel right for a long time, don’t wait for it to worsen. Seek medical advice immediately,” he urges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Importance of regular check-ups and awareness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sharma’s message serves as a reminder that cancer awareness and preventive healthcare are just as important as treatment itself. Routine medical check-ups, self-examinations, and an understanding of one’s own body can significantly reduce the risk of late-stage cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He encourages people to avoid self-medication or ignoring recurring symptoms.

According to data from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, around 7 million farmed birds have died from the illness since the start of September. This includes the death of over 1 million turkeys from bird flu, causing supply concerns for the upcoming holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Outbreaks of bird flu typically flare up in the fall due to the seasonal migration of wild birds. This migration brings different bird populations together, increasing the virus' spread into new areas and into domestic flocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is an outbreak of bird flu this fall important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the most popular bird to cook for Thanksgiving, turkeys are generally in very high demand throughout the month of November. The outbreak of bird flu this fall may increase turkey prices by reducing the supply of available healthy turkeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Outbreaks during the fall migration can lead to the culling of large numbers of birds in an attempt to stop the spread. This can result in a shrinking overall flock size and higher prices due to tighter production and decreased supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With the recent government shutdown and revised policies of U.S. government agencies, an accurate representation of this season's bird flu outbreak may be unavailable to many. This could leave experts without the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Because of the government shutdown, I know less than I would normally know," &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/22/health/h5n1-bird-flu.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Amy Swinford, director of the Texas A&amp;amp;M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about bird flu?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlike previous outbreaks, the current bird flu outbreak has persisted for years and has been confirmed in every U.S. state at some point since 2022.

The outbreak of bird flu was identified as the leading cause of a spike in egg prices across the country over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To combat the spread of bird flu, animal science experts at Michigan State University offered several easy-to-follow &lt;a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/fall-brings-bird-flu-risks-what-poultry-owners-need-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommendations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for farmers and breeders.

It began with one woman stepping into the streets and dancing, not for joy or celebration, but seemingly against her will. Within days, dozens joined her, and by the end of the month, hundreds of citizens were writhing and spinning uncontrollably. They danced until their feet bled, until they collapsed from exhaustion, and, in some cases, until they died. This strange and terrifying event, known as the Dancing Plague of 1518, remains one of history’s most haunting medical mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://karger.com/books/book/343/chapter-abstract/5558187/The-Dancing-Manias-Psychogenic-Illness-as-a-Social?redirectedFrom=fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Frontiers of Neurology and Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; examined this medieval epidemic as an early example of mass psychogenic illness, a condition where psychological distress manifests physically within a community. The researchers suggest that the people of Strasbourg, reeling from famine, disease, and deep religious anxiety, may have collectively experienced extreme stress that erupted as uncontrollable dancing. This intersection of social trauma and superstition turned one woman’s strange movements into a full-blown public crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strasbourg &lt;keyword id="30187572" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="dancing-plague" source="keywords"&gt;dancing plague&lt;/keyword&gt; 1518: A city on the edge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strasbourg in the early 16th century was no stranger to hardship. Poor harvests, high grain prices, and outbreaks of disease had left the population malnourished and desperate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many believed they lived under the shadow of divine punishment. When Frau Troffea, the first dancer, began her frantic movements, people didn’t think of medicine or madness. They thought of sin. Local chronicles record that the afflicted were encouraged to keep dancing, as authorities believed it was a form of penitence that might purge evil spirits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the days passed, the dancing grew impossible to ignore. Markets and squares filled with swaying, trembling figures, some laughing, others weeping or shouting prayers as if in a trance. Physicians were called, but their remedies, from bloodletting to music, only made things worse. Bands were even hired to “aid the cure,” their rhythms fuelling the frenzy rather than calming it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What caused the dancing plague of 1518?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, historians and scientists have debated what caused this bizarre outbreak. One early theory blamed ergot poisoning, a toxic mould found on damp rye bread that can cause hallucinations and convulsions. While this might explain some of the delirium, ergotism also causes extreme pain and muscle contractions, symptoms that would make prolonged dancing nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern scholars lean toward psychological explanations. The most supported theory today views the 1518 outbreak as mass hysteria, triggered by collective trauma and religious fear. A society steeped in apocalyptic beliefs, facing starvation and disease, may have channelled its suffering into a contagious form of physical expression. In essence, they danced because their minds and bodies could not cope with reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The role of religion in the Strasbourg dance epidemic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious fervour played a central role in spreading the panic. Many believed that St. Vitus, the patron saint of dancers and entertainers, could curse people with uncontrollable movements if angered. When panic spread, the church organised processions and rituals to honour the saint, hoping to appease divine wrath. Ironically, these gatherings may have intensified the spread, not of disease, but of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This episode reveals just how powerful belief and social suggestion can be. Similar outbreaks of collective behaviour have occurred throughout history, from fainting fits in convents to laughter epidemics in schools. Human beings are profoundly social creatures. Under stress, we mirror one another’s emotions, sometimes to the point of shared physical collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The dancing plague and mass hysteria in modern times&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a city-wide dance plague feels unthinkable today, the psychology behind it remains deeply relevant. Mass anxiety, moral panic, and contagious fear still shape public behaviour, only now they spread through social media instead of city squares. The 1518 dancing plague reminds us that the human mind, when pushed to its limits, can blur the line between body and belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five centuries later, the streets of Strasbourg are quiet, but the story lingers, a chilling reminder that under the right conditions, even reason can lose its rhythm. The dancing plague was not just a mystery of medicine. It was a reflection of human vulnerability, faith, and the strange ways we seek release from suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition, which causes long-term and often debilitating exhaustion, affects millions of people around the world, including more than 400,000 individuals in the UK. Despite its prevalence, ME/CFS has remained poorly understood and notoriously difficult to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new test, which demonstrates 96 percent accuracy, offers renewed hope to patients who have struggled for recognition and reliable answers. Researchers believe the discovery could also lead to a similar test for identifying long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validating an Illness Long Dismissed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Prof Dmitry Pshezhetskiy of UEA's Norwich Medical School explained, "ME/CFS is a serious and often disabling illness characterized by extreme fatigue that is not relieved by rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that some patients report being ignored or even told that their illness is 'all in their head'. With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to see if we could develop a blood test to diagnose the condition -- and we did!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our discovery offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Post-Covid syndrome, commonly referred to as long Covid, is one example of ME/CFS, where a similar cluster of symptoms is triggered by the Covid-19 virus, rather than by other known causes such as glandular fever. We therefore hope that our research will also help pave the way for a similar test to accurately diagnose long Covid."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using DNA Folding to Detect Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To develop the test, researchers employed Oxford BioDynamics' advanced EpiSwitch® 3D Genomics technology, which examines how DNA is folded within cells. The study analyzed blood samples from 47 people with severe ME/CFS and compared them to 61 healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each human cell contains around two metres of DNA, intricately folded in three dimensions. These folds are not random; they form deliberate patterns that help control how genes are activated or silenced, keeping the body functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandre Akoulitchev, Chief Scientific Officer at Oxford BioDynamics, said, "Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is not a genetic disease you're born with. That's why using EpiSwitch 'epigenetic' markers -- which can change during a person's life, unlike fixed genetic code -- was key to reaching this high level of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The EpiSwitch platform behind this test, together with OBD's vast 3D Genomic knowledgebase, has already been proven to deliver practical, rapid blood diagnostics accessible at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With this breakthrough, we are proud to enable a first-in-class test that can address an unmet need for a quick and reliable diagnostic for a complex, challenging-to-identify illness."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven Technology Behind the Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EpiSwitch technology has previously helped identify blood-based biomarkers for other complex conditions, including fast-progressing ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), rheumatoid arthritis, and several cancers. It also underpins the EpiSwitch PSE prostate cancer test, which delivers world-leading accuracy and is already in clinical use across the UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ME/CFS study, researchers found a distinctive genomic pattern present only in affected individuals and absent in healthy participants. This work looked beyond the linear DNA sequence explored in the large DecodeME study, which was the most extensive genetic investigation of ME/CFS to date.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining the 3D architecture of DNA, the UEA and Oxford BioDynamics team uncovered hundreds of additional biological differences, including five of the eight genetic regions previously identified by DecodeME. This deeper insight could advance scientific understanding of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncovering Biological Clues for Future Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new analysis demonstrated exceptional precision, achieving 92 percent sensitivity (correctly identifying those with ME/CFS) and 98 percent specificity (correctly identifying those without it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also observed signs of immune system involvement and inflammation pathways, suggesting potential biological targets for future therapies. These findings may help determine which patients are most likely to benefit from specific treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward More Accurate Diagnosis and Personalized Care&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a significant step forward," said UEA's Prof Pshezhetskiy. "For the first time, we have a simple blood test that can reliably identify ME/CFS -- potentially transforming how we diagnose and manage this complex disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Additionally, understanding the biological pathways involved in ME/CFS opens the door to developing targeted treatments and identifying which patients might benefit most from specific therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope that the Episwitch® CFS test could become a vital tool in clinical settings, paving the way for more personalized and effective care."&lt;/p&gt;

Difficulty sleeping through the night, restless tossing, and frequent daytime naps are common early warning signs. In later stages, patients often experience "sundowning," a period of increased confusion and agitation that tends to occur later in the day. These patterns hint at a close relationship between Alzheimer's progression and the circadian system -- the internal body clock that regulates sleep, wakefulness, and other daily biological cycles. Until recently, however, scientists did not fully understand how deeply this connection ran.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has now demonstrated, in mouse models, that Alzheimer's disease disrupts circadian rhythms within specific brain cells. This disturbance alters how and when hundreds of genes switch on and off, changing key processes that help the brain function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published October 23 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that restoring or stabilizing these internal rhythms could open up a new approach to treating Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are 82 genes that have been associated with Alzheimer's disease risk, and we found that the circadian rhythm is controlling the activity of about half of those," said Erik S. Musiek, MD, PhD, the Charlotte &amp;amp; Paul Hagemann Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, who led the study. In mice engineered to model the disease, these genes no longer followed their usual daily patterns. "Knowing that a lot of these Alzheimer's genes are being regulated by the circadian rhythm gives us the opportunity to find ways to identify therapeutic treatments to manipulate them and prevent the progression of the disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Burden of Sleep Disruption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musiek, who co-directs the Center on Biological Rhythms and Sleep (COBRAS) at WashU Medicine and specializes in aging and dementia, noted that disturbed sleep is one of the most frequent problems reported by caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. His earlier work showed that sleep changes begin years before memory loss becomes evident. Beyond exhaustion for both patients and caregivers, these disruptions create stress that may accelerate the disease's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking this cycle, he said, starts with identifying where it begins. The body's circadian system regulates roughly 20% of all genes in the human genome, orchestrating vital processes such as digestion, immune response, and sleep-wake cycles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In earlier research, Musiek identified a protein called YKL-40 that naturally fluctuates throughout the day and helps control normal levels of amyloid in the brain. Too much YKL-40, which is linked to Alzheimer's risk in humans, can trigger the build-up of amyloid -- a sticky protein that forms plaques, one of the hallmarks of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amyloid's Effect on the Brain's Timing Mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Alzheimer's symptoms follow a repeating daily pattern, the team suspected more circadian-regulated proteins and genes might be involved. In the new study, they examined gene activity in the brains of mice that developed amyloid build-up, as well as in healthy young mice and older mice without plaques. Samples were collected every two hours over a full 24-hour period to track how gene expression changed across the circadian cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that amyloid deposits disrupted the normal rhythm of hundreds of genes in two key types of brain cells -- microglia and astrocytes. Microglia act as the brain's immune cells, clearing away waste and harmful materials, while astrocytes help neurons communicate and maintain healthy function. Many of the affected genes are normally responsible for microglia's ability to remove waste, including amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these genes were not entirely switched off, their usual order and timing became chaotic, weakening the brain's coordinated system for removing toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Rhythms and Potential Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that amyloid plaques appeared to create new rhythmic patterns in genes that do not usually follow a daily cycle. Many of these genes are involved in inflammation or the brain's response to stress and imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Musiek, these discoveries suggest that therapies aimed at adjusting circadian rhythms in microglia and astrocytes could support healthier brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of things we still need to understand, but where the rubber meets the road is trying to manipulate the clock in some way, make it stronger, make it weaker or turn it off in certain cell types," he said. "Ultimately, we hope to learn how to optimize the circadian system to prevent amyloid accumulation and other aspects of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fc2d88eb-1c65-49e1-949d-cf9430f5132e"&gt;At one point, you might have seen exercise mainly as a way to change how your body looks. But as you get older, you start to realize how transformative it can be for future-proofing your body, improving your everyday movement, and for reducing the risk of injury, aches and pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to personal trainer and Pilates instructor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/eloiseallexia/?hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/eloiseallexia/?hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Eloise Skinner&lt;/a&gt;, there’s one area you should pay some extra attention to if you’re training for longevity—your core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="fc2d88eb-1c65-49e1-949d-cf9430f5132e-2"&gt;The core comprises all of the muscles around your stomach and lower back, including the abdominals, obliques and pelvis. “Core strength is really important as we get older, for both men and women,” Skinner tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you train your body to activate those deep core muscles, it can be really protective,” says Skinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you slip or trip, your body can use the core to stabilize and protect you. If your body isn’t used to using core strength to take the force of a movement, it will usually place that force somewhere else, like your lower back or another joint,” Skinner says, adding this could easily lead to injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stronger core also makes daily life easier. “Getting up from a chair, standing up from the floor, picking up your grandchildren—all those depend on the strength and alignment of your body, so the core is really, really important,” says Skinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are Skinner’s three go-to moves to build core strength and stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-i2uC9bBAviEptkYabt5J7W" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-i2uC9bBAviEptkYabt5J7W slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-roll-down" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-roll-down"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

&lt;p&gt;On November 2, Dr Brian Hoeflinger – a neurosurgeon with 26 years of experience from Ohio in the US – took to Instagram to explain that high blood pressure is known as the 'silent killer' because it often doesn't show any symptoms, and people can go years without knowing they have the condition until a severe health issue arises.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The dangers of untreated hypertension&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video he posted, Dr Hoeflinger talked about how elevated blood pressure damages the blood vessel lining, leading to plaque buildup, known as atherosclerosis, which narrows vessels and reduces blood flow to vital organs. According to Dr Hoeflinger, this can cause fatal&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-shares-top-prevention-tips-for-people-in-20s-30s-40s-to-reduce-risk-of-heart-attacks-heart-disease-101755066069846.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart attacks"&gt; heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; or strokes, and almost 50 percent of individuals with high blood pressure don't experience symptoms, making regular monitoring crucial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do you know why high blood pressure is known as the silent killer? Because what happens when you have elevated blood pressure? That causes injury to the lining of your blood vessels in your body. And that injury results in a buildup of plaques known as atherosclerosis. And these plaques, as they build up, narrow the blood vessels. And once the blood vessels narrow, you get less blood flow to your body,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Hoeflinger added: “Particularly if you get less blood flow to the heart or brain, that can result in a heart attack or stroke, which can be fatal. Unfortunately, up to 50 percent of the people that have high blood pressure don't have symptoms from it and don't even know that they have it.

		&lt;p&gt;Cold evenings, busy shelters and anxious owners raise the same question: how do you settle an adult dog with calm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the UK, rescues expect a seasonal rise in adult adoptions as nights draw in. A clear first fortnight reduces stress, prevents bites and cuts the risk of returns. Here is a practical roadmap for people bringing home a grown dog, with costs, timings and simple steps that build trust quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why autumn adoptions demand a plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorter days, wet pavements and fireworks can rattle even the steadiest rescue dog. Many arrive with an emotional history and unfamiliar routines. Homes feel noisy. Streets smell different. A plan narrows the world, adds predictability and stops misunderstandings from snowballing into anxiety or reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day one is about safety, not affection quotas. Reduce choices, give structure, and let the dog opt in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set up a safe base within one hour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the dog steps inside, prepare a quiet corner away from through-traffic and doorways. Choose a draft-free spot near warmth, but not next to a radiator that could overheat a resting body. Keep it stable for the first week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Room layout that lowers cortisol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavy, non-slip bed or crate with the door open for choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fresh water within two metres, changed twice daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two tough chews to channel stress into licking and gnawing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baby gate to manage access without confrontation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soft cloth with familiar scent if provided by the rescue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set feeding and walking at predictable times. Use the same tone of voice and the same short phrases. Predictability reduces uncertainty, which reduces adrenaline spikes and barking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 7-day routine that calms adult dogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Day(s)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Focus&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Practical measure&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1–2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Decompression&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Short garden breaks, house tour on lead, one room base camp, gentle hand-feeding.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3–4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Safe walks&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Two 15-minute walks on a Y-harness, quiet streets, allow sniffing, no greetings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5–7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Light training&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Three 3-minute sessions: name response, settle on mat, swap game for toys.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anchor mealtimes 10–12 hours apart. Keep play brief and frequent. Sleep drives recovery; an adult rescue may need up to 16 hours of rest spread across the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five mistakes that cost you time, money and trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much freedom, too soon. Roaming leads to toilet slips and guarding. Use doors, pens and routines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcing introductions. Crowds, pubs and family parties overwhelm. Start with one person at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skipping the early vet check. Hidden pain fuels growls. Budget £120–£180 for a baseline consult and core vaccinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using only a collar. A secure harness plus ID tag reduces escapes and injury; expect £25–£40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correcting fear with scolding. Fear punished becomes fear plus you. Pay calm, reward curiosity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behaviour is often a pain story. Treat discomfort and half the “naughtiness” fades without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Health check in 48 hours: what to ask your vet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book an appointment within two days. Bring any rescue paperwork and note changes you observe at home. Ask targeted questions to build a health baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccinations, microchip registration and parasite cover plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral health: gum inflammation and worn teeth affect mood and food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobility: screen for arthritis and cruciate issues; request a pain trial if murky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight: set a target range and feeding grams, not “cups”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skin and ears: rule out allergies that drive rubbing and snapping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noise sensitivity ahead of fireworks: consider desensitisation and vet-approved aids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading the small signals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult dogs speak softly before they shout. Ears pinned, head turns, slow blinking and yawning show discomfort. Lip licking outside mealtimes can flag tension. A stiff tail says caution, not confidence. When you notice uneasy signals, reduce demands, add space and switch to calm, low-arousal tasks like scenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, lower the ask, raise the distance, and pay the calm you want to see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social introductions without the meltdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People first, then pets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One visitor at a time, seated, no looming over the dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the dog the choice to approach; no touching unless they request it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scatter a handful of treats away from feet to relieve social pressure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Walking beyond the postcode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-clip the lead to harness and collar for backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start at quiet times; add busier places for short intervals mid-walk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep ID on at all times; update the microchip record the same day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The calm contact method that builds trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think “I am available, not insistent”. Sit on the floor with a turned shoulder and relaxed hands. Drop snacks next to you without eye contact. If the dog checks in, gently stroke chest or shoulder for two seconds, then stop and let them ask again. Short, predictable kindness beats marathon cuddles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training that lowers stress fast&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle on a mat: reward any glance or paw on the mat. Build to 60 seconds of relaxed resting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hand targeting: dog taps your palm, you pay. Handy for redirection away from triggers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swap cue: present treat, say “swap”, take toy only after the dog releases. Prevents guarding rows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep sessions tiny. Three minutes, three times a day, in the quietest room. Progress comes from repetition, not heroics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to do when setbacks appear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many adult dogs follow the 3-3-3 pattern: three days to decompress, three weeks to learn the routine, three months to feel at home. Expect wobbles around week three as confidence grows. Regression is common after busy weekends. Dial back the schedule, rebuild the routine and practise the calm contact method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extra help when history is unclear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If behaviour feels sticky, book two sessions with a reward-based trainer accredited by a UK body. Bring video clips from daily life, a sleep log and a list of triggers. One well-timed change—like moving the bed or swapping the route—often releases the knot more than a dozen corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Added gains you can bank this month&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budgeting protects the bond. Price your first-month essentials: £120–£180 vet baseline, £40 harness and lead, £25 tag and bowls, £30 bedding, £20 chews and food puzzles. Pet insurance reduces shocks; look at excess amounts and dental cover. Keep receipts; charities may offer discounts if you adopted from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For enrichment, think nose, not speed. Scatter feeding in the garden, a rolled towel with kibble for unwrapping, cardboard “parcel” puzzles and short scent trails indoors drain stress without overexciting. Rotate toys every two days so novelty works for you. A calm brain learns. A predictable home heals. And a measured first week pays off for years.&lt;/p&gt;

The surgeon also listed some everyday foods and beverages that may be fuelling the disease. What are they? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in India and it’s fully treatable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Red meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Dr Zaghiyan advises avoiding red meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork. “There's about an 18% increased risk of colorectal cancer in people who regularly consume red meat. We don't know of a safe amount, and if you're charring your meat, i.e. cooking it over a flame, that adds even more risk,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Processed meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second on the surgeon’s list is processed meats such as bacon, sausages, hot dogs, ham, salami, pepperoni, and deli meats. “Any of these are processed meats, and they increase your risk of colorectal cancer by 15 to 35% if you're eating one serving a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The less you eat, the better. There is no defined safe amount,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sweetened beverages&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, sugary drinks are not just adding extra calories; they are also a red flag for your overall health. Store-bought juices, carbonated sodas, and fizzy drinks may taste sweet, but they are making your health bitter. “These beverages are artificially sugared with high-fructose corn syrup, sucrose, and fructose, and consumption of these has been associated with the development of colorectal cancer. A study found that two servings a day of sugared beverages doubled your risk of colorectal cancer versus those individuals who had it less than once a week,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer? Quit, or at least limit, alcohol intake. Dr Zaghiyan emphasises that this includes beer and wine. “This is particularly magnified in individuals who consume alcohol daily. However, there is no safe amount that has been defined. Alcohol not only increases your risk of colorectal cancer, but it also increases your risk of multiple other cancers,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods such as chips or ready-to-eat noodles are convenient, but they come at the hidden cost of your health. The colorectal cancer surgeon suggests avoiding anything that comes pre-packaged. “These include chips, packaged cereals, packaged baked goods, and a lot of store-bought breads. All fall into the category of ultra-processed foods,” she explained. The doctor adds that these foods are linked with an increased risk of various gut conditions and colorectal cancer.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/our-genomes-are-full-of-junk-dna-that-could-be-way-more-important-than-we-realized"&gt;Sections of DNA&lt;/a&gt; once dismissed as dormant and useless could in fact be recruited to fight certain types of drug-resistant blood cancers, new research has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as 'junk' DNA, these bits of DNA don't encode proteins, so were historically dismissed as having no role in biological processes. &lt;span&gt;Scientists have since realized non-coding parts of the genome are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-a-crucial-new-role-for-dna-we-once-considered-junk"&gt;more important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-sea-dragons-fabulous-features-is-in-their-genes"&gt;than we thought&lt;/a&gt;, playing critical roles in gene regulation&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One category of non-coding DNA is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element"&gt;transposable element&lt;/a&gt; (TE): sequences that can cut themselves free from one part of the genome and insert themselves into another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mitochondria-dump-their-rubbish-dna-and-it-could-be-costing-us-our-health"&gt;Mitochondria Dump Their Rubbish DNA, And It Could Be Costing Us Our Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team led by researchers from King's College London (KCL) has now found that stubbornly persistent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hepatitis-treatment-prevents-the-progress-of-a-common-blood-cancer"&gt;blood cancers&lt;/a&gt; can 'wake up' TEs as part of the mechanisms that lead to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="179304" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells going awry – and that this same activity could potentially be targeted to shut the cancers down.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mitochondria-dump-their-rubbish-dna-and-it-could-be-costing-us-our-health"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to validate these findings, which come from experiments with lab-grown cells, but unlocking a new pathway to target blood cancers could lead to treatments for cancers harboring specific mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery offers new hope for patients with hard-to-treat cancers, by using existing drugs in a completely new way, turning what was once thought to be useless DNA into a powerful target for treatment," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/research-uncovers-new-treatments-for-hard-to-treat-blood-cancers"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biologist Chi Wai Eric So, from KCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research focuses on two blood cancers, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelodysplastic_syndrome"&gt;myelodysplastic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352428"&gt;chronic lymphocytic leukemia&lt;/a&gt;. Mutations typically found in these cancers damage the genes &lt;em&gt;ASXL1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EXH2&lt;/em&gt;, affecting protein production and leading to uncontrolled cell growth. A cascade of instability then follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179310" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CancerSuppression.jpg" alt="DNA cancer treatment graphic" class="wp-image-179310 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CancerSuppression.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/CancerSuppression-600x225.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179310" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers blocked the repair system used by cancer cells to fix DNA damage (top row), killing off the cancer. (Zeisig et al., &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes targeting these cancers particularly tricky is that the mutated genes no longer produce proteins that conventional cancer therapies would target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models of cancer and human &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-treatment-safely-kills-cancer-cells-with-light"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found another knock-on effect of &lt;em&gt;ASXL1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EXH2&lt;/em&gt; damage: reactivated junk DNA duplicating and spreading by inserting their sequences throughout the cancer cells' DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unfettered behavior stresses the cancer cells. To resist that stress and continue growing, the cancer becomes reliant on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poly_(ADP-ribose)_polymerase"&gt;poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase&lt;/a&gt; repair proteins – or PARPs for short. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARP_inhibitor"&gt;Drugs that suppress PARPs&lt;/a&gt; were shown to be effective at killing off the two tested blood cancers. What's more, healthy cells were mostly left alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study sets the stage for a novel and broader approach of creating synthetic lethality for human cancers," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2025028560"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are confident their findings apply to other &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-report-links-alcohol-to-six-major-cancer-types"&gt;types of cancers&lt;/a&gt; as well, not least because PARP blockers are already used to fight other forms of cancer, although the exact mechanisms involved differ.&lt;br&gt;

Recent studies have found these DNA regions – which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-evidence-suggests-at-least-75-of-the-human-genome-is-actually-junk-dna"&gt;make up a large portion&lt;/a&gt; of the genome – help &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-junk-dna-may-help-prime-our-immune-system-to-fight-viruses-at-least-in-marsupials"&gt;regulate the body's defenses&lt;/a&gt;, aid the brain in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/genetic-link-to-fear-disorders-found-hiding-within-what-we-once-dismissed-as-junk-dna-in-mice"&gt;dealing with fear&lt;/a&gt;, and even protect species &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/junk-dna-could-be-why-different-species-can-t-interbreed"&gt;from interbreeding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Transposable elements that account for almost half of the human genome, but are historically regarded as ancient junk sequences, have been reported in recent years to be reactivated in driving disease development, and multiple cellular processes including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.cd-23-0331"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt;, DNA damage, and immune responses," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2025028560"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2025028560"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In total, biopsies from more than 4,000 men will be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool, which analyses digitised biopsy images to produce a personalised risk score, has already &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/30/new-ai-test-can-predict-which-men-will-benefit-from-prostate-cancer-drug" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;been shown in clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; to identify which men with high-risk prostate cancer would be most likely to benefit from the drug abiraterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, trials in the US have suggested it could also be used for less aggressive forms of prostate cancer to predict which men are most likely to benefit from having hormone therapy in addition to radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition, studies have suggested the tool can help identify which patients can be monitored without the need for immediate treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: “If and when this gets implemented, you could use one tool irrespective of where you are on the aggressiveness scale, to make a very clinically and life-enhancingly important decision for each of those men.”. He added that the tool was already being widely used in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The new study will first use prostate biopsy samples from men who have already been diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer, and have suitable follow-up data, to explore whether the predictive prowess of the tool is seen when applied to UK patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The tool will then be tested at three sites – North Bristol NHS trust, Oxford University hospitals NHS foundation trust, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde – as men undergo the normal pathway for prostate cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Biopsies will be analysed, the treatment choices will be made, and the man will start treatment. But at the same time, the NHS clinicians will be given a readout from this tool and asked: ‘If you had this, would you have recommended the same treatment or not?’” said Hobbs, adding that part of the trial would also explore to what extent the tool affected the time between diagnosis and treatment choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts say the hope is that the tool will eventually help reduce under- and over-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A good outcome from this is that this tool is implemented in the NHS,” said Hobbs. However, for that to happen, he said, it had to be shown to be scientifically valid, cost-effective, and making a difference to treatment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Gerhardt Attard, from University College London, who was involved in the study around abiraterone use but is not part of the trial, said the research was important as approaches often worked well in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When you take that to the real NHS world, there are a number of challenges and differences that would inevitably arise and that’s what this study will address,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ashley Dalton, the minister for public health and prevention, also welcomed the trial. “This groundbreaking research could be a huge step forward, demonstrating the power of technology to potentially transform lives and improve cancer outcomes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is exactly why we’re investing in a digital NHS. By harnessing AI and moving beyond outdated systems, we can transform cancer care – diagnosing earlier, treating more effectively, and improving patient experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNVWY3RlFVcm1ZTXBTSGpCMjlKcnprNnNSMl9xS0ZFblhZaXZuRmRQdnJGUXNXN2FoMHdaTDFSaVF1RUlsRHpOZ2ZoTGM1RVJzdTBHVVZVUF9fUldwQjlfYWt6aUhpaGtDb0hXQXBlVkJ4bkhvODU3MklQM0k2T2ZvNmdTS1NDbkFDOGhxVl84c0xiQ2dpNTN5QzJLUFhHbnRUcWhmTzZpamxkV19rNEZQTEtYSENVSkFmWkdVcUN2UlI</guid></item><item><title>男性需要比女性锻炼更多才能降低心脏病。原因如下。- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/men-need-to-exercise-more-than-women-to-lower-heart-disease-heres-why</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Exercise is like medicine for the heart, and just like with medication, you need the right "dose" for it to be effective. But a recent study suggests that the dose might not be the same for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that men need roughly twice as much exercise as women to see the same reduction in their &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/heart-disease-329"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-025-00732-z"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; asked over 85,000 UK adults aged 37-73 to wear an accelerometer (a device that measures body movement and activity levels) on their wrist for seven days. They then tracked each participant's health outcomes for just under eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-heartbeat-budget-could-help-keep-track-of-your-health-study-suggests"&gt;A 'Heartbeat Budget' Could Help Keep Track of Your Health, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who did roughly four hours of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week – activities, such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling or dancing, which raise your breathing and heart rate – had around a 30% lower risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men needed to do roughly nine hours of the same types of physical activity to see a similar reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642.jpg" alt="man riding a bike" class="wp-image-179856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/man_cycling_heart_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Men need to do twice as much exercise as women to reduce heart disease risk by the same amount. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEI_kBvy3g/"&gt;ArtistGNDphotography/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was also true for people already living with heart disease. The paper estimated that women diagnosed with coronary heart disease needed to do around 51 minutes of physical activity each week to reduce their risk of death from any cause by 30% – while men needed to do around 85 minutes of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these findings might sound shocking to the average person, they confirm something that exercise scientists have suspected for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a clear biological reason that can partly help explain why women and men see such different results from physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biological differences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women typically have higher oestrogen levels than men. This hormone has important effects on how the body responds to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oestrogen can help the body &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2004-1743"&gt;burn more fat for fuel&lt;/a&gt; during endurance exercise and helps keep the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13293-017-0152-8"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; healthy – partly by supporting their energy-producing mitochondria (the tiny powerhouses inside cells that generate energy for vital functions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also tend to have more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ca.24091"&gt;slow-twitch muscle fibres&lt;/a&gt;, which are efficient and fatigue-resistant. These muscles suit the kinds of steady, sustained physical activity most exercise guidelines recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the gap in "minutes needed" for similar heart benefits between women and men isn't as shocking as the findings might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the study used &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169649"&gt;device-measured activity&lt;/a&gt;, instead of asking people to recall from memory the amount of activity they did, this means the data on physical activity was accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to note the study still showed a graded benefit. More total weekly activity was linked to lower risk of coronary heart disease in both women and men. Everyone gains from moving more. The difference is just in how much activity buys the same reduction in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study does not claim that women should do less exercise – nor that men can't reach similar benefits. It only shows that men may need more weekly activity to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179859" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642.jpg" alt="woman exercising" class="wp-image-179859 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/woman_outside_exercising_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179859" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Women still need to do the recommended amount of exercise each week to keep their hearts healthy. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGxWNwr2I0/"&gt;Artem Varnitsin/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are limits to keep in mind. Activity was measured for only one week – then people were followed for about eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, as it's an observational study, other factors that could have partly influenced the results were not taken into account – such as menopausal status (when oestrogen levels drop significantly) or whether a woman was using hormone replacement therapy (which can restore some oestrogen levels). These factors could influence how women's bodies responded to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also worth noting that the volunteers came from the UK Biobank study. These volunteers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwx246"&gt;tend to be healthier&lt;/a&gt; and less deprived than the general population – factors which can affect baseline heart health, access to safe places to exercise and time available for physical activity. This can affect how widely the results apply to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, these results make an important point about current exercise recommendations and whether they need to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current exercise guidelines from the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24/1451"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, the American Heart Association and the NHS are sex-neutral. But this new study challenges these recommendations – showing they might not apply equally to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, most exercise research was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.17226/12908"&gt;done predominantly in men&lt;/a&gt; and results were often assumed to apply equally to women. As better device-based data arrives, we're learning that women and men may get different returns for the same number of active minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because women and men &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.117.004437"&gt;experience heart disease differently&lt;/a&gt; – from symptoms to outcomes. If the amount of exercise needed to reach the same benefit also differs, our advice should reflect that while still keeping things simple and practical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't about telling women to exercise less. The 150-minute baseline remains a useful target – &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.12.019"&gt;and many people don't yet meet it&lt;/a&gt;. What these findings suggest is that women who meet current targets may see more heart health benefits per minute of exercise. That's encouraging news for anyone who struggles to find time for longer workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For men, the message isn't "double your gym time". It's to keep building activity in ways that fit your week – with more total minutes bringing even greater heart health benefits. Whether different types or intensities of exercise might be more efficient for men remains a question for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men and women clearly benefit from regular physical activity. That's not in question. But what does need to be recognised is the clear biological differences that influence the returns men and women see from the same types of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001289"&gt;Cardiac rehabilitation&lt;/a&gt; and exercise referral schemes often set identical targets for men and women. This new research suggests we may want to rethink schemes and tailor goals to each person's starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But until cardiac rehabilitation becomes more personalised, the core message for now is: move more, sit less. Aim for the baseline 150 minutes of exercise each week if you can. More helps if you're able to.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/268624/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;
