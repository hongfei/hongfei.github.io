&lt;p&gt;Want to stay healthy this cold and flu season — and look good doing it?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s a budget-friendly fruit in season right now that’s bursting with nutrients, low in calories and might just be the secret weapon your immune system and skin need this winter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An added bonus: Your brain will also get a boost. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;By providing antioxidants and vitamin C, these fruits can brighten skin tone, improve texture and reduce wrinkles.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clementines, better known by their brand names Cuties or Halos, are like the smaller, sweeter cousins of the orange. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tiny citrus fruits are easy to peel, usually seedless and hit peak season from October through January.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t let their small size fool you: &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168195/nutrients" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;One clementine&lt;/a&gt; clocks in at just 35 calories but delivers 36.1 mg of vitamin C — nearly 40% of what you need daily for optimal health. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C is essential nutrient, meaning your body can’t make it on its own so you need to get it from your diet. It’s a powerhouse for your immune system, helping to destroy infectious microbes while keeping your tissues safe from damage. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23440782/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that getting enough vitamin C on a regular basis can help reduce the severity and duration of cold and flu symptoms. However, there is little evidence that popping vitamin C once you are already sick will speed recovery, so consistency matters when it comes to eating clementines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In the US, most clementines are grown in California and Florida.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Markus Mainka – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The perks don’t stop at immunity. Vitamin C is also crucial for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/05/health/boost-collagen-in-your-skin-with-this-small-fruit-twice-a-day/"&gt;collagen&lt;/a&gt;, the protein that keeps your skin firm, plump and smooth. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Maintaining adequate collagen levels can reduce fine lines, prevent sagging and even speed up wound healing. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clementines are also packed with other antioxidants, like flavonoids, which can fight inflammation, calm redness and soothe skin conditions like acne or rosacea.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And with their high water content, these juicy snacks can help the skin stay hydrated, preventing dryness and flakiness.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the goodness doesn’t end there. Clementines contain folate and thiamine, two B vitamins that are crucial for your body, supporting everything from cell development to a healthy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while a single clementine only has about 1 gram of fiber, snacking on a few throughout the day is an easy way to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/30/health/what-is-fibermaxxing-dietitian-warns-about-viral-trend/"&gt;boost your intake&lt;/a&gt;, supporting digestion, gut health and weight management. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like other citrus fruits, clementines are brain-friendly, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Clementines are nutrient-dense, helping promote brain function and healthy aging.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;WavebreakMediaMicro – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They contain bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that help protect the brain from damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Studies on animals have shown that supplementing the diet with citruis fruits improves deficits in learning and memory, particularly spacial memory, which helps us remember where we’ve put things and recognition memory, which is vital for facial and name recall,” Dr. David Vauzour, a senior research fellow at Norwich Medical School, &lt;a href="https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/03/03/The-role-of-citrus-in-brain-health-Citrus-bioactive-compounds-improve-general-cognition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told FoodNavigator&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Clementines are also a rich source of hesperidin, a bioflavonoid with antioxidant properties that may help reduce inflammation, improve blood flow in the brain and support overall brain cell health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40694049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that getting hesperidin in your diet can help improve cognitive functions such as attention, learning and memory, as well as psychomotor skills like movement and coordination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40694049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that eating citrus fruits like clementines daily could cut the risk of developing dementia in older adults by nearly 15%.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;They might even help your mood. Last year, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/09/health/eating-this-fruit-daily-can-lower-depression-risk-by-20-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;scientists found&lt;/a&gt; that people who ate a daily serving of citrus had about a 20% lower risk of being diagnosed with depression. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The effect seems to be specific to citrus,” Raaj Mehta, the lead study author, told &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/02/eating-citrus-may-lower-depression-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Harvard Gazette&lt;/a&gt;. “When we look at people’s total fruit or vegetable consumption, or at other individual fruits such as apples or bananas, we don’t see any relationship between intake and risk of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But before you grab a bag and start peeling, there’s something to keep in mind about clementines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some research has shown that clementines contain furanocoumarins, a compound also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3589309/"&gt;found in grapefruit&lt;/a&gt; that can interfere with certain medications, including &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27890698/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cholesterol-lowering statins&lt;/a&gt;, and potentially cause complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be safe, experts recommend checking with your doctor or pharmacist about possible drug interactions before adding large amounts of citrus fruit to your daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A person carrying measles traveled through Gaston County while infectious, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Health officials ask anyone who was at Constantine’s Restaurant in Gastonia after 8:30 p.m. on Dec. 26, 2025, to monitor for measles symptoms until Jan. 16.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The individual also attended Christmas Town USA in McAdenville from 5:30 to 8 p.m. on Dec. 26, 2025.

It also included 279 influenza-associated pediatric deaths, the highest reported to the agency during a seasonal influenza epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This year, a new variant, subclade K, has emerged and the flu season started earlier than usual in Europe, with “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/17/new-flu-strain-sweeping-across-europe-is-putting-pressure-on-healthcare-says-who" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high or very high influenza activity&lt;/a&gt;”, in December in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the United States, there had been an estimated 7.5m influenza cases and 81,000 hospitalizations by 20 December. That marked a 25% increase in cases over the previous week, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Thirty-two states&lt;/a&gt; have seen a “high or very high” number of flu illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“A lot of people are getting the flu at the same time, which is always tough. That is actually tougher than a situation in which people get it and it’s spread out over a longer period,” Nuzzo said. “It could be a worse season, in part because more people are going to need care than hospitals can easily deliver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Epidemiologists are also concerned that fewer people could opt to get the flu vaccine because the CDC, led by the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, canceled &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj.r389" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;its campaign&lt;/a&gt; encouraging people to get the shot. At the start of December, about 130m flu vaccines had been distributed in the US, 13m less than at the same point last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccine-doses-distributed.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s completely incredulous to me that after experiencing the worst flu season for kids on record that we could head into this flu season – with signs that it could be bad, based on the viruses circulating out there – with anything but a robust plan to encourage people to get vaccinated,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some US residents could also be concerned about how much protection the new round of vaccine shots offer against the latest variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We have some reason to think that the protection may be lower, but I want to be careful by saying” that, Nuzzo said. “It may protect you less, but it’s likely still going to give you some important protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People also might not be aware that they can pick up an at-home test from a pharmacy, Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There are some people who might benefit from medication if they tested positive, but that medication needs to be given very soon after symptoms start,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQMDViMWVKYm1xc3FCalY1VVJ3cTF2NDRteHlJQWgwQl8zc3JMSWxGNTRVM09mSGZmYzZhdzl3MllTNDFRbG9FcGNhVjRrZTNnV0RkR1FaNVBoUnFPanl2TXBQUUlYekh6cDdkY2haUkpWMXVXZmpBRWxBNThUZVowdA</guid></item><item><title>在令人痛苦的研究中揭示了罗马边疆生活的恐怖- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/horror-of-life-on-roman-frontier-revealed-in-gut-wrenching-study</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Roman soldiers garrisoned at the fort of Vindolanda, located near Hadrian's Wall in northern England, were riddled with parasites that sapped their fighting fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to lice-infested tunics and runny noses, Rome's military might have dealt with chronic gut infections that caused diarrhea, stomach cramps, and nausea, according to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/parasite-infections-at-the-roman-fort-of-vindolanda-by-hadrians-wall-uk/49A5CBC021F5C3D85D040D4FD1A9AD44"&gt;jointly performed archaeological study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by researchers from Cambridge and Oxford.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the Romans were aware of intestinal worms, there was little their doctors could do to clear infection by these parasites or help those experiencing diarrhea, meaning symptoms could persist and worsen," says Marissa Ledger, an archaeologist at McMaster University in Canada who co-led the study while completing her PhD at Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These chronic infections likely weakened soldiers, reducing fitness for duty. Helminths alone can cause nausea, cramping, and diarrhea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-british-history-s-most-worm-infested-people-and-it-s-not-who-d-imagine"&gt;Study Reveals British History's Most Worm-Infested People, And It's Not Who You Think&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed just under 60 samples of sewer drain sediments containing ancient poop and other detritus that washed away from the fort and nearby settlements, dating to the 3rd century CE.

(Ledger et al., &lt;em&gt;Parasitology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous archaeological explorations in the area have unearthed a trove of organic materials that have been preserved in Vindolanda's waterlogged soil. These finds include more than &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-roman-bigfoot-unusually-large-shoes-puzzle-archaeologists"&gt;5,000 leather shoes&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-wooden-phallus-might-be-a-rare-2000-year-old-dildo"&gt;wooden phallus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindolanda_tablets"&gt;over 1,700 thin wooden tablets&lt;/a&gt; inscribed with ink, which document day-to-day habits at the fort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This daily martial life would have revolved around guarding Hadrian's Wall, just north of the fort. Established in the early 2nd century CE, the wall is a defensive fortification running east-to-west from the North Sea to the Irish Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ease occupation on this Roman-British frontier, the fort had baths, toilets, and drinking water. Regardless, the soldiers still suffered from intestinal infections, including roundworms, whipworms, and potentially &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-11-zoonotic-diseases-can-get-to-you-through-your-animal-friends"&gt;Giardia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/giardiasis/index.html"&gt;diarrhea-causing&lt;/a&gt; microscopic single-celled animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latter pathogen is an exciting find for researchers, if not so much for those past soldiers, because it's the first evidence of &lt;em&gt;Giardia duodenalis&lt;/em&gt; in Roman Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Vindolanda's bath complex, with its previously mentioned amenities, outbreaks occurred due to poor sanitary practices. Specifically, fecal contamination in food, water, and on the soldiers' hands helped spread these parasites throughout the fort and throughout time – samples collected from a fortification constructed in 85 CE also contained roundworm and whipworm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, parasite sufferers would have become severely ill from dehydration via chronic infections that could linger for weeks, "causing dramatic fatigue and weight loss." These conditions bred other severely deleterious intestinal pathogens, setting the scene for outbreaks of &lt;em&gt;Salmonella&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written or uncovered evidence reveals many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/roman-trade-routes-carried-tuberculosis-across-globe"&gt;other types of Roman-reared infections&lt;/a&gt;. On one occasion, 10 soldiers were deemed unfit for duty due to conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, which &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/conjunctivitis-caused-by-poop"&gt;can occur&lt;/a&gt; when eyes come into contact with poop-laden fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the parasite profile at Vindolanda is similar to that from other Roman military sites, including those in Austria, the Netherlands, and Scotland. One reason may be the more-limited, pork-heavy diet, as described in preserved texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, "Urban sites, such as London and York, had a more diverse parasite range, including fish and meat tapeworms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for all the modern romanticism surrounding Roman hygiene, the history is often dirtier and more fecal-infested than imagined. It's also worth noting that nearly 2,000 years ago, Vindolanda sat at Rome's northwestern frontier, and frontier settlements often faced the harshest hardships – made all the harsher when its defenders had 30-centimeter (12-inch) roundworms snaking through their guts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/parasite-infections-at-the-roman-fort-of-vindolanda-by-hadrians-wall-uk/49A5CBC021F5C3D85D040D4FD1A9AD44"&gt;Parasitology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/parasitology/article/parasite-infections-at-the-roman-fort-of-vindolanda-by-hadrians-wall-uk/49A5CBC021F5C3D85D040D4FD1A9AD44"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) has identified three public places someone with measles may have exposed others to the disease.Thoe locations are:Nose Dive restaurant at 116 S. Main Street, Greenville, S.C. on Dec. 24 from 1:30 to 4:30 pmBest Buy at 1125 Woodruff Road, Suite 1201, Greenville, S.C. on Dec. 24 from 3 to 6 p.m.The Spartanburg County Public Library at 151 at S. Church Street, Spartanburg, S.C. for the Solar Superstorms planetarium show on Dec. 27 from 3:15 to 6:30 p.m. According to DPH, the person did not know they were infectious at the time. DPH is not aware of any risk for measles exposure at these locations beyond this period of time."People exposed at any of these locations who are not immune could begin developing early symptoms of measles now," a DPH official said Saturday. "DPH is asking anyone who was at any of these locations during those specific days and times to contact your health care provider if you believe you may have been exposed, if you do not have immunity to measles or if you develop symptoms.""People who were exposed, especially those without immunity through vaccination or previous disease, should monitor for symptoms through Jan. 17. Symptoms typically begin within 7-12 days (but up to 21 days) after exposure, and start with a cough, runny nose, and red eyes, along with a mild to moderate fever.""Two or three days later, the fever spikes, often as high as 104°F. At the same time, a red blotchy rash appears, first on the face and head, then rapidly spreads down the remainder of the body. A person with measles is contagious from four days before the rash appears through four days after its onset, so someone may be able to spread measles before they know they have the disease. It is important to stay home if you are ill.""If anyone who may have been exposed develops an illness with fever (101°F or more), cough, runny nose or red eyes, with or without rash, immediately call a health care provider and let them know about the exposure and symptoms so that they can tell you what to do next. Special arrangements will be needed to evaluate you without putting other patients and medical office staff at risk of exposure. You will be asked to stay at home until the doctor clears you.""The MMR vaccine is the most effective way of protecting oneself against measles. Anyone who is not up to date on MMR vaccination or does not have immunity from prior infection, is encouraged to receive a dose of MMR vaccine, unless there is a medical reason why you cannot receive it. The MMR vaccine is effective and safe. The DPH Recommendations for MMR Vaccination chart can help you understand if you need a dose of the vaccine. The MMR vaccine is available at a pharmacy or provider included on the DPH online vaccine locator or at DPH Health Departments."

The research also suggests that women who engage in self-stimulation during adolescence may experience orgasms more frequently with partners later in life. These findings were published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19317611.2025.2565374" target="_blank"&gt;International Journal of Sexual Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solitary sexual activity is a normal aspect of human development and is widely practiced. Despite its prevalence, the subject often remains surrounded by silence and social stigma. This is particularly true for women, who have historically faced different social standards regarding sexuality compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous scientific literature has established that masturbation can offer health benefits and improve sexual functioning. However, less is known about the specific psychological and social factors that influence this behavior in women. A lack of open discussion often leads to gaps in information regarding female biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers Daniela Henriques, Pedro Alexandre Costa, and Ana Carvalheira sought to investigate these dynamics. Henriques is affiliated with the ISPA-University Institute in Lisbon, Portugal. The team aimed to assess how much women understand about their genital anatomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also wanted to identify which demographic and personal factors are linked to the frequency of masturbation. Another primary goal was to analyze the connection between early sexual experiences and adult sexual satisfaction. The researchers were particularly interested in how habits formed during teenage years might relate to the ability to reach orgasm with a partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gather this data, the scientists designed a web-based survey. They recruited 469 adult women of Portuguese nationality to participate. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 78 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey included a specialized questionnaire designed to measure knowledge of female anatomy. This section presented statements about the vulva, vagina, and clitoris. Participants had to identify whether these statements were true or false.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One section of the study assessed “genital self-image.” This concept refers to a woman’s feelings and beliefs regarding her own genitals. The survey asked participants to rate their agreement with statements about their comfort with and perception of their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also collected detailed data on sexual behaviors. They asked about the age at which participants first masturbated. They also inquired about the frequency of this behavior during adolescence and within the past twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results regarding anatomical knowledge revealed substantial gaps in understanding. The data showed that roughly 74 percent of the participants possessed a low or average level of knowledge about female genitalia. Misconceptions were particularly common regarding the clitoris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey included specific questions about the size and shape of the clitoris. For example, it asked if the clitoris is an internal structure shaped like the wings of an airplane. A majority of the women did not identify this as a true statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many participants also held incorrect beliefs about the physical dimensions of the clitoris. Nearly half of the respondents provided incorrect answers regarding its length. These findings highlight a pervasive lack of education regarding the internal structure of the primary organ responsible for female pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these gaps in knowledge, the prevalence of masturbation was high. Approximately 96 percent of the women reported having masturbated at some point in their lives. The average age at which they began this behavior was just over 14 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frequency of current masturbation varied among the group. The most common frequency reported was once a week. About one-quarter of the active participants selected this option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used statistical analysis to determine which factors best predicted how often a woman masturbates. They found that age was a strong predictor. Younger women tended to report higher frequencies of self-stimulation than older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Place of residence also appeared to play a role. Women living in urban environments reported masturbating more often than those in rural areas. The researchers suggest that urban settings might offer more privacy or exposure to progressive views on sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relationship status was another determining factor. Single women reported engaging in solitary sexual activity more frequently than those in committed relationships. This finding aligns with the idea that some women use masturbation to replace partnered sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious attendance showed a clear negative association with the behavior. Women who attended religious services more often were less likely to masturbate frequently. This likely reflects the influence of conservative moral teachings regarding autoeroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond demographics, the study found a strong link between anatomical knowledge and behavior. Women who scored higher on the anatomy quiz tended to masturbate more often. This suggests that understanding one’s body may facilitate sexual expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern emerged regarding genital self-image. Women who felt more positive about the appearance and function of their genitals were more likely to engage in self-stimulation. Comfort with one’s body appears to remove barriers to sexual exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also uncovered an association between adolescent behavior and adult sexual response. Women who reported higher frequencies of masturbation during their teenage years experienced orgasms more often during partnered sex as adults. This correlation was observed specifically for orgasms achieved during vaginal penetration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that early self-exploration serves a learning function. Through masturbation, adolescents may discover what types of stimulation they prefer. This self-knowledge can then be transferred to sexual interactions with partners later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the relationship between current masturbation and partnered sex showed a different pattern. For adult women, a higher frequency of masturbation was associated with a lower frequency of orgasm during partnered sexual activity. This suggests a compensatory dynamic for some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that for some adult women, masturbation may serve to fill a gap left by unsatisfying partnered encounters. If a woman does not reach orgasm with her partner, she may turn to self-stimulation to achieve sexual release. The data supports both the idea of masturbation as a learning tool and as a compensatory act, depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors noted several limitations that should be considered when interpreting these results. The study relied on a convenience sample recruited online. This method may attract participants who are more comfortable discussing sexuality than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample consisted entirely of cisgender women from Portugal. Cultural and religious specifics of the country may influence the findings. Consequently, the results might not fully apply to women in different cultural or legal environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey also relied on self-reported data. This introduces the possibility of recall bias, particularly when participants were asked to remember behaviors from their adolescence. Additionally, the study did not provide a rigid definition of masturbation, leaving it open to participant interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the research offers evidence that female masturbation is a multifaceted behavior. It highlights the importance of comprehensive sex education. The authors argue that education should go beyond reproduction to include anatomy and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better knowledge of the clitoris and other structures could help destigmatize female sexuality. Promoting a positive genital self-image could also improve sexual well-being. The researchers recommend that future studies investigate these relationships in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also suggest that clinical interventions for sexual difficulties should consider masturbatory history. Understanding a patient’s comfort with their own body can provide context for treating sexual dysfunction. Ultimately, the study reinforces the idea that solitary sex is an integral part of a woman’s sexual health profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19317611.2025.2565374" target="_blank"&gt;‘Ménage À Moi’: An Analysis of Factors Associated with Masturbation Among Women&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Daniela Henriques, Pedro Alexandre Costa, and Ana Carvalheira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:10:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPdWx5ZndEWnd6dGZwaFdlTkUyUDg1MnZuZEs5TDY0NldwN09ycXBIT1RneWdNcFZNM2NsdW8xVkRDaVRDV0lmNlV5dkFZeVdQRVlHeUpOemU4dDlMRzI1UDhXVFdvNE5tSVU4Vnc2SmVBRmNxcEVmeFU5V2NlSFJBVU1OMUpYcjRuMEU3STZpTlpmdw</guid></item><item><title>全球最具传染性的疾病正在美国机场蔓延-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/most-contagious-disease-world-spreading-150000558.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.explore.com/travel/coronavirus-flying-hotels-travel-safety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;COVID-19 caused travel restrictions and other changes&lt;/a&gt; to how people get around. &lt;a href="https://www.explore.com/travel/avoid-sick-traveling/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Avoiding getting sick while traveling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Avoiding getting sick while traveling&lt;/a&gt; is tricky, as COVID-19, flu, and common colds easily spread when dozens of people sit shoulder to shoulder inside planes, trains, or buses.

Like COVID-19 and the flu, measles spreads through particles in the air after someone carrying the disease coughs or sneezes. Its particles also linger in the air for up to two hours, meaning you can catch measles even without direct contact. After around two centuries of documented measles existence, researchers created a vaccine in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccine skeptics have long existed around the world, but recent years have seen a higher percentage of parents choosing not to vaccinate their children. Gavi attributes this to vaccine misinformation, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and other global crises. Multiple health officials have publicly tried to ease people's minds by stating that vaccines are safe and effective as long as enough members of a population receive them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Getting measles despite being vaccinated is incredibly uncommon, but all travelers can take solace in the fact that cases are still fairly low nationwide. If you think you might be sick, wearing a mask can prevent you from spreading anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ready to discover more hidden gems and expert travel tips? &lt;a href="https://subscribe.explore.com/newsletter-syndicated?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=explore-NL-feed" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Subscribe to our free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Subscribe to our free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for access to the world's best-kept travel secrets.

It’s prescribed in clinics of all sizes and sits in medicine cabinets in homes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many doctors have viewed tramadol as a compromise. Stronger than over-the-counter options, yet thought to be easier on the body than other opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That reputation helped it spread fast. But a close look at the science tells a less comforting story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tramadol-in-chronic-pain-care"&gt;Tramadol in chronic pain care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large review of existing research took a hard look at how well tramadol actually works for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chronic-pain-is-harder-to-treat-in-women-but-a-new-target-offers-hope/"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers pulled together results from many past studies and compared tramadol to a placebo, a dummy treatment with no active drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team set out to answer a simple question: Does this medication truly help people feel better, and at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-tramadol-became-so-common"&gt;Why tramadol became so common&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tramadol is a dual-action opioid that eases pain through more than one mechanism. Doctors commonly prescribe it for moderate to severe pain, both short-term and chronic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, tramadol appears in several &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mindfulness-meditation-is-a-powerful-weapon-against-chronic-pain/"&gt;pain management&lt;/a&gt; guidelines. Over time, prescriptions climbed sharply, making tramadol one of the most frequently used opioids in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rise did not happen by accident. Many doctors believed tramadol caused fewer side effects and carried a lower risk of addiction than other short-acting opioids. Patients often felt more comfortable taking it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-earlier-studies-missed"&gt;What earlier studies missed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tramadol has been studied before, but earlier reviews did not fully answer the big questions. Most focused only on whether the drug reduced pain, not on safety. Others looked at limited types of pain. Important gaps remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fill those gaps, the researchers searched medical databases for randomized clinical trials published up to February 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trials compared tramadol with placebo in people living with chronic pain, including &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cannabis-may-ease-cancer-symptoms-like-pain-and-nausea/"&gt;cancer-related pain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-closer-look-at-the-trials"&gt;A closer look at the trials&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final analysis covered 19 clinical trials with 6,506 participants. Five studies looked at nerve pain. Nine focused on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-confirm-the-best-treatments-for-osteoarthritis-are-not-medications/"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;. Four examined chronic low back pain. One studied &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fibromyalgia-pain-scientists-may-have-finally-solved-the-mystery/"&gt;fibromyalgia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average participant was 58 years old, with ages ranging from 47 to 69. Most studies tested tramadol tablets. Only one looked at a topical cream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment lasted anywhere from 2 to 16 weeks. Follow-up periods ranged from 3 to 15 weeks. That matters because many side effects and long-term risks take time to show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-small-relief-big-risks"&gt;Small relief, big risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked at all the results together, a clear picture emerged. Tramadol did ease pain, but only a little. The change was too small to meet the usual standards for meaningful relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may have noticed some improvement, but it likely didn’t translate into better day-to-day function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight of the trials also followed participants for serious side effects over periods ranging from 7 to 16 weeks. In those studies, tramadol was linked to roughly twice the risk of harm compared with a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That higher risk was driven largely by heart-related problems, including chest pain, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tramadol use was also linked to a higher risk of certain cancers, though the researchers noted that the short follow-up made this finding “questionable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-common-side-effects"&gt;Common side effects &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all trials, tramadol was tied to more common side effects like nausea, dizziness, constipation, and sleepiness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These issues may sound mild, but they can make daily life harder, especially for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also pointed out problems with the studies themselves. Many outcomes were at high risk of bias. That likely means the benefits of tramadol were overstated, while its harms were understated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-opioids-in-the-bigger-picture"&gt;Opioids in the bigger picture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings land in the middle of a much larger opioid crisis. According to the authors of the study, approximately 60 million individuals worldwide experience the addictive effects of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-discovery-offers-hope-for-tackling-opioid-addiction/"&gt;opioids&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 2019, drug use was responsible for approximately 600,000 deaths, with nearly 80% of these fatalities associated with opioids and approximately 25% resulting from opioid overdose,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the United States, the number of opioid-related overdose deaths increased from 49,860 in 2019 to 81,806 in 2022.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given these trends and the present findings, the use of tramadol and other opioids should be minimized to the greatest extent possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pain-relief-that-comes-with-a-price"&gt;Pain relief that comes with a price&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weighing the evidence, the team summed it up plainly. Tramadol may have a slight effect on reducing chronic pain while likely increasing the risk of both serious and non- serious adverse events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential harms associated with tramadol use for pain management likely outweigh its limited benefits,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a drug so widely used and often trusted, that conclusion carries a lot of weight. It suggests that tramadol’s place in chronic pain care deserves serious rethinking, not because it does nothing, but because what it offers may simply not be worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/09/26/bmjebm-2025-114101"&gt;BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 14:16:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNenZncy02LWllcHFtd1JEUkZoQ1RBblVmMEdiejRzWEUwV0NSX2RnX05qUU1YNG91eFU2bE5Na2p1N25wSkl0LWpsR01lX25STUNaaVhvRWNYNHVkQjBhN3VmQnVuUXJVWnowSDJsNmdrVElfNk9aSzdmdWxtYTdSUGI2QzFVM2tuRFVZWDNn</guid></item><item><title>出生时双手比指尖小的小婴儿在一年后回到家中，并正常发育-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tiny-baby-born-with-hands-smaller-than-a-fingertip-is-now-home-after-a-year-and-developing-normally/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;
        &lt;figure id="attachment_227569" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-227569" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-227569" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Preemie-baby-Gabriel-Golden-at-Vanderbilt-NICU-SWNS.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-227569" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Preemie baby Gabriel Golden at Vanderbilt NICU-SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A premature baby, born so tiny his hand was smaller than his dad’s fingertip, is finally home and healthy after a year in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Golden was born weighing one pound in September 2024 after just 22 weeks gestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He endured nearly a year in the Vanderbilt NICU in Nashville, Tennessee, battling chronic lung disease and multiple infections before his parents Caroline and Garreth were finally able to bring their son home three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little Gabriel still faces respiratory challenges, but is thriving developmentally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was amazing that somehow, even though his finger was so small, I could feel his grip,” said his father Garreth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The strength those tiny fingers held left me speechless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caroline started hemorrhaging 14 weeks into the pregnancy, and for a harrowing eight weeks, doctors warned daily that she could miscarry at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She recalls bleeding constantly while on bed rest and stuck at home. When at 18 weeks, Caroline’s water broke. The preemie wasn’t considered viable, so the couple waited in limbo until 22 weeks, when Caroline was hospitalized with hopes of buying more time for their son’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical team presented stark statistics—and the numbers were devastating: a less than five percent survival rate, with greater than 90 percent odds of neurological problems, heart defects, and vision or hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The biggest thing is that their lungs are barely developed,” Caroline said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 22 weeks and four days, Caroline went into labor during an emergency situation that put both their lives at risk. Garreth watched helplessly as medical staff rushed his wife to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re having her sign paperwork that she could die from the surgery,” recalled Garreth, who spent a lot of time “not knowing what to think or what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against all odds, Gabriel was able to use the breathing tube and survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_227572" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-227572" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-227572" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gabriel-Golden-is-finally-home-SWNS.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-227572" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gabriel Golden is finally home -SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he still had to battle severe broncho-pulmonary dysplasia—a chronic lung disease that left his lungs scarred and rigid. The couple said goodbye to their son on three separate occasions during his first six weeks of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AGAINST ALL ODDS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Guinness Record Holder for Most Premature Baby is Thriving at 1-Year Old–and All Giggles After ‘Zero Odds’ to Live" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/guinness-record-holder-for-most-premature-baby-is-now-thriving-at-one-year-old-and-all-giggles-after-zero-odds-to-live/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Guinness Record Holder for Most Premature Baby is Thriving at 1-Year Old–and All Giggles After ‘Zero Odds’ to Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple pneumonia infections also set him back, and doctors eventually determined he would need a tracheostomy to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the ordeal, Garreth traveled three hours each way to his job, continuing to work so they could pay their bills and Caroline tried to maintain a bedside vigil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their church community provided financial support, and four primary nurses at Vanderbilt became like family during Gabriel’s extended stay. “We couldn’t have done it without them,” Caroline said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One nurse specifically was with us for nine and a half months. I personally couldn’t have done it without her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_227571" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-227571" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-227571" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gabriel-Golden-family-at-Vanderbilt-NICU-SWNS.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-227571" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gabriel Golden family at Vanderbilt NICU-SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caroline, who had always dreamed of being a mother, says the experience transformed the couple’s faith and perspective on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was thrust into a situation where my faith was the only thing I had to cling to. Now it’s stronger than I ever thought it could be.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Gabriel is home, he still requires a tracheostomy and faces respiratory challenges, but there’s good news, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By the grace of God, Gabriel is completely developmentally appropriate, and has no brain issues,” Caroline told SWNS news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Other than his lungs, his body is in wonderful working condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience gave Garreth a new perspective when he walked through the children’s hospital and saw other families facing their own battles.&lt;/p&gt;

In the months that followed, Gopie struggled to get out of bed and couldn't spend time with her daughter. Her husband was essentially "a single dad for eight months," she said. Routine appointments fell by the wayside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After nearly a year, Gopie finally began to feel better. She was determined to make up for lost time. She took her daughter to visit family in New York, Canada and Trinidad. Soon, her daughter was walking and talking. Gopie was so distracted by "getting to love on my baby" that she continued skipping regular appointments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, Gopie realized that a cut she had given herself while shaving had become infected. Her primary care physician reminded her of the importance of annual appointments, especially her mammogram. She said her &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dense-breast-tissue-mammogram/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;dense breasts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; qualified her for earlier screenings. After their conversation, Gopie made an appointment. The results of her mammogram were abnormal, so her doctor ran another test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Christmas Eve, she received the results: She had Stage III breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"Just saying that C-word ripped me and my husband to pieces," Gopie, now 42, said. "I remember us both crying like two-year-olds. And my husband's holding my daughter. My daughter's like, 'It's OK, Dada. It's OK, Mama.' She didn't know any better, she was just trying to make her parents stop crying." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coping with aggressive treatment &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gopie and her family celebrated that Christmas as normally as possible. On December 26, she said they "hit the ground running" to get a second opinion and figure out a treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further testing determined that Gopie had triple-positive breast cancer. The subtype affects about 10% of breast cancer patients, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/triple-positive-breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. It has hormone receptors that make it more likely to respond favorably to treatment, but tends to be aggressive and present at a later stage, said Dr. Stuart Samuels, a radiation oncologist at the University of Miami Health System's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center who treated Gopie. The disease had also spread to Gopie's lymph nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors recommended aggressive treatment beginning with chemotherapy. It had uncomfortable side effects, including pain, nausea and vomiting, Gopie said. Eventually, she lost her hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Gopie said it was hard to spend time with her daughter or stay focused at work. Gopie did what she could, prioritizing family time. When she was too sick to be with her daughter, she wrote letters to her and planned activities for when she was feeling better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;"As a mom, you just keep jumping through another hoop, and you're like, 'It's OK, as long as she's good,'" Gopie said. "You just keep going." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video diary, recorded before each treatment session, became a surprising source of strength, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would tell that video how I felt, if I was happy, if I was sad, if I was nervous, what I think I'm going to expect that day, what I think I want for that day. I prayed every day and I still pray, but talking to myself every time before chemo helped a lot," Gopie said. "I realized doing those videos helped me to just release my feelings at that time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"It gets overwhelming" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finishing chemotherapy, Gopie underwent a double mastectomy. Samuels said surgeons found "quite a bit of cancer left in the breast," as well as in her armpit. That meant she would need radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuels administered the treatment over the next three weeks. Gopie said the radiation had new side effects, including intense headaches and a burning feeling in her skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later tests showed she would need more chemotherapy. The treatment was exhausting, Gopie said, and made it hard for her to work and spend time with her family. Most of her focus went to just putting one foot in front of the other, she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Gopie is still "in a limbo area," Samuels said, but "the hardest part is over." When Gopie spoke to CBS News, she was still undergoing radiation, taking a daily medication and receiving a regular hormone therapy infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She still has an aggressive cancer, but she's just living her life," Samuels said. "Now it's really about recovery and enjoying her daughter." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;"Learning to be the new Ameilia"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gopie said she has been working on finding a new normal. She recently had reconstructive surgery and said she is beginning to feel more like herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's interesting, you know, the life that I live. I'm trying to maintain the old Ameilia, but now to go through the new journey that I'm going through, I'm also learning to be the new Ameilia, who goes through pains and nausea and wakes up with huge headaches and has a three-year-old," Gopie said. "It gets overwhelming." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout it all, the depression that haunted Gopie early in her daughter's life has never returned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Thank goodness, I haven't gone through that," Gopie said. "I try my best to enjoy life. I know I'm going to be fine. I want to enjoy every second with my baby. I want to sing with her and laugh at her and dance with her and write things to her and leave it all over the house. I keep it positive."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;One of the ways scientists are trying to improve &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breakthrough-breast-cancer-pill-extends-survival-in-7-year-trial"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; is by better equipping &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;the body's own immune system&lt;/a&gt; to fight off the disease – and a new study identifies a molecular switch that can do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through an extensive screening process in which genes in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="187392" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells in the lab were 'switched off' to pinpoint their effects, researchers found that a gene producing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/cdd.2014.123"&gt;the TAK1 protein&lt;/a&gt; was crucial for cancer cells to evade immune attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-treatment-safely-kills-cancer-cells-with-light"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; in mice with normal immune systems then confirmed how vital TAK1 is for cancer: Tumors in mice without this protein grew more slowly, and the mice survived for longer, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-anti-cancer-drug-discovered-inside-japanese-tree-frog"&gt;Powerful Anti-Cancer Drug Discovered Inside Japanese Tree Frog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team from institutions in Australia and Ireland believes their findings could aid in the development of future treatments. Medications could potentially directly target TAK1 production, and 'flip' this molecular switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187395" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TAK1Effect.jpg" alt="TAK1 protein effect" class="wp-image-187395 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TAK1Effect.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TAK1Effect-600x557.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187395" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at how the TAK1 protein affected cancer cells. (Djajawi et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is known that TAK1 promotes cancer cell survival and blocks cell death," &lt;a href="https://www.onjcri.org.au/news/research/onjcri-researchers-discover-molecular-safety-switch-shielding-cancers-from-immune-attack/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cancer cell biologist Anne Huber, from the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Research Institute (ONJCRI) in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we didn't know that cancer cells use this tactic to avoid killing by the immune system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huber and colleagues examined in greater detail the mechanisms underlying TAK1's effect. Specifically, it protects cancer cells from the activity of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell"&gt;CD8⁺ T cells&lt;/a&gt;, immune cells that clear out damaged cells and kill deadly invaders like cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way these CD8⁺ T cells are effective is by releasing chemical signals called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cytokines&lt;/a&gt;, which can more readily reach their targets when TAK1 is absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how this process works in detail could help scientists better harness it for cancer treatments. When TAK1 is removed, cancer cells are essentially trying to survive without one of their best bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180218" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180218" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-642x642.avif" alt="cartoon illustrating immune cells as characters " class="size-medium wp-image-180218" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-642x642.avif 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-675x675.avif 675w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-768x768.avif 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2-600x600.avif 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/c3ac86_ea1154e7cdc342f590b63a2d2771db07mv2.avif 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180218" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;CD8+ cells and natural killer (NK) cells both play a role in killing deadly pathogens.

There's reason to believe the results can translate to humans, but that work still needs to be carried out and extended to a broader range of cancers (this study looked mainly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/air-pollution-may-protect-people-from-skin-cancer-but-at-a-terrible-cost"&gt;at melanoma&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these findings are encouraging. One of the benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/boosted-natural-killer-cells-could-lead-to-off-the-shelf-cancer-immunotherapy"&gt;immunotherapy approaches&lt;/a&gt; to tackle tumors is that they lean more heavily on the body's own defences, rather than chemotherapy drugs or radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patient safety is always a crucial consideration whenever it comes to cancer-fighting treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopping the production of TAK1 may be feasible in the future, but investigators will need to determine potential adverse health effects on the rest of the body and weigh them against the benefits.&lt;br&gt;

(WOLF) — &lt;/span&gt;As the new year starts, doctors are urging the public to watch out for the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year it mutates and vaccine manufacturers try to account for the changes but since they’re developed in February to be available by the end of the year, experts say some years the vaccine is more effective than others as they try to anticipate and react to each year's individual strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Influenza has eight different gene segments, and the H is one of them," explained Geisinger's medical director for infection prevention Dr. Mark Shelly. "And that’s the hemagglutinin. That’s the thing that attaches to us. So, and that’s also what our antibodies attack. So, if we’ve got a hemagglutinin that’s pretty recognizable, all the antibodies do a pretty good job. If it’s not as recognizable the old antibodies don’t help. And this one specifically has enough changes in the H to confuse some old antibodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health saying flu activity was increasing rapidly by the end of 2025 and with the increase of cases, comes an increase of shots. Local pharmacies saying that more people are coming in to get the flu shot than normal for this time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“October was like, almost 20 to 30 flu shots a day," said Alexandra Riggleman, a pharmacist at DePietro's Pharmacy in Dunmore. "And like I said, it usually slows down right now but we’ve been getting like 10 to 20 a day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though this year’s vaccine might not be able to stop somebody from getting the flu, doctors say it is still recommended as it lessens symptoms and keeps elderly and at-risk patients out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine has been administered billions of times, has been tested tirelessly, and is considered one of the safest vaccines in the industry, with the chance that a patient leaves with something worse than a sore arm being close to zero. Getting the vaccine is the number one preventative method against the flu and it's so easy, I even got mine while covering this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t have to force me to get a vaccine every year. I do it on purpose. I did it when I was 40, I’m doing it in my 60s. You know, I just do it," continued Shelly. "It’s not something I say: ‘you do it, so you protect me’, no. I do it because I protect myself, my family, and everybody else around me and my patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>fox56.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 09:47:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE55YThKemJJZklidndGblRKeGlkaE5nMTlaZ1dLeXBFc3I1YUxIeEJ5MjFrdXBkY05ra3dmVVFaWG1iX3JuS1dWcTJETWgxODBoNE5CSjM2OURDbFpYMHlRMm5kc29mVUVBZmZUcnNXQXBNdHdnUVhIUjR4WWo</guid></item><item><title>科学家测试了间歇性禁食而不减少进食，发现没有代谢益处- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251228020018.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A new study from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke (DIfE) and Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin challenges a widely held belief about intermittent fasting. The research shows that time-restricted eating does not lead to measurable improvements in metabolic or cardiovascular health when calorie intake remains unchanged. However, the timing of meals did affect the body's internal clocks. These findings come from the ChronoFast study led by Prof. Olga Ramich and were published in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a form of intermittent fasting that limits daily food intake to a window of no more than ten hours, followed by a fasting period of at least 14 hours. The approach has become popular as a simple strategy to support weight management and metabolic health. Animal studies show that TRE can protect rodents from diet-related obesity and metabolic problems. In humans, earlier studies have reported benefits such as improved insulin sensitivity, healthier blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and modest reductions in body weight and body fat. As a result, TRE has been widely viewed as a promising tool for preventing insulin resistance and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting Evidence From Earlier Studies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its popularity, past research on TRE has produced mixed results. Many studies have not been able to determine whether observed health improvements came from shorter eating windows, unintentional calorie reduction, or a combination of both. In addition, most earlier trials did not carefully track calorie intake or control for other factors that could influence metabolic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these gaps, Prof. Olga Ramich, Head of the Department of Molecular Metabolism and Precision Nutrition at the DIfE and Professor at the Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, designed the ChronoFast trial. The goal was to test whether an eight-hour eating window could improve insulin sensitivity and other metabolic markers when calorie intake was kept constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the ChronoFast Study Was Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study used a randomized crossover design and included 31 women with overweight or obesity. Each participant followed two different eating schedules for two weeks at a time. One schedule involved early time-restricted eating between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.(eTRE). The other followed a later schedule from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. (lTRE). Throughout both phases, participants ate nearly identical meals with the same calorie and nutrient content (isocaloric).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected blood samples during four clinic visits and performed oral glucose tolerance tests to assess glucose and fat metabolism. Continuous glucose monitoring tracked blood sugar levels over 24 hours while food intake was recorded in detail. Physical activity was monitored using a motion sensor. In collaboration with Prof. Achim Kramer from the Charité -- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, the team also examined changes in the body's internal clock using isolated blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring the Body's Internal Clock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human biology follows internally generated rhythms that roughly align with the length of a day, which is why they are known as circadian clocks (Latin: circa and dia). These rhythms help regulate nearly every physiological process, including sleep and metabolism. Almost all cells in the body contain their own internal clock, which can be influenced by light, physical activity, and food timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure individual circadian phases, Prof. Dr. Achim Kramer developed the BodyTime assay. This test requires only a single blood sample and provides an objective snapshot of a person's internal timing. The ChronoFast study used this method and confirmed that eating schedules can shift internal clocks in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Metabolic Improvements Found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite expectations based on earlier research, the ChronoFast study found no clinically meaningful changes in insulin sensitivity, blood sugar, blood fats, or inflammatory markers after the two-week interventions. "Our results suggest that the health benefits observed in earlier studies were likely due to unintended calorie reduction, rather than the shortened eating period itself," explains Ramich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While metabolic measures remained largely unchanged, the timing of meals did affect circadian rhythms. Analysis of blood cells showed that the internal clock shifted by an average of 40 minutes during the late eating schedule compared to the early schedule. Participants following the later eating window also went to bed and woke up later. "The timing of food intake acts as a cue for our biological rhythms -- similar to light," says first author Beeke Peters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories and Individual Timing May Matter Most&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the importance of calorie balance in achieving health benefits from intermittent fasting. "Those who want to lose weight or improve their metabolism should pay attention not only to the clock, but also to their energy balance," Ramich concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to explore whether combining time-restricted eating with reduced calorie intake produces stronger benefits. Scientists also aim to better understand how individual factors, including chronotype and genetics, may influence how people respond to different eating schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He explained, “It can lead to numbness or tingling in the body, and sometimes, even while driving, you might suddenly feel dizzy. These may seem like minor issues, but they shouldn’t be ignored.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The doctor stressed that even small signs need attention. “Sudden bouts of dizziness or other mild symptoms shouldn’t be overlooked. If any of these signs appear, a B12 level test should be done as soon as possible. The good news is that it can be detected with a simple &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-test" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood test"&gt;blood test&lt;/a&gt;, and the treatment is straightforward. Something so small can cause major issues if left unchecked.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How can timely intervention help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kothari added that timely intervention not only helps prevent serious health complications but also ensures better energy levels, improved &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/new-study-says-skipping-breakfast-doesn-t-slow-brain-function-or-reduce-focus-in-adults-101762237367324.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="brain function"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;, and overall well-being.

                &lt;p&gt;When &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nutritionist-eats-high-protein-diet-without-ultra-processed-foods-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rob Hobson&lt;/a&gt;, a registered nutritionist based in the UK, found out his cholesterol levels were "really high" in June, he decided to manage them through diet, focusing particularly on increasing his fiber intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, when he tested again, his &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chickpea-recipes-to-lower-cholesterol-science-backed-advice-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; had improved, and he'd discovered four tricks that make eating more fiber easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a fatty substance the body needs for many bodily processes, but if a person has too much LDL or "bad" cholesterol, it can form sticky plaque in their arteries, putting them at greater risk of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-look-healthy-heart-disease-failure-stroke-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce cholesterol levels, the American Heart Association recommends exercising at least 150 minutes a week, quitting smoking and vaping, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a heart-healthy diet that's low in saturated fats and high in fiber. If these measures don't help, then statins, a medication that lowers LDL cholesterol, will likely be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson, the author of "Unprocess Your Life" and "The Low Appetite Cookbook," already worked out for around an hour each morning, and ate &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-look-healthy-heart-disease-failure-stroke-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;minimal ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and saturated fats. So he zeroed in on fiber.&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;p&gt;Eating at least 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber a day can help lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, according to the National Lipid Association. Quinoa, oats, avocado, sweet potatoes, carrots, and chia or flax seeds are good examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are Hobson's tips for seamlessly adding more fiber to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1a4aa01f-6ea0-4848-8371-896ad3e1f530" data-toc-id="1a4aa01f-6ea0-4848-8371-896ad3e1f530"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson is a big advocate of breakfast because it lends itself to high-fiber foods such as oats, nuts, and seeds. "It's really easy to get plenty of fiber in at that time of day," he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has two go-to breakfasts that he eats on repeat. The first is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/quick-easy-high-protein-high-fiber-breakfast-every-morning-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Greek yogurt bowl&lt;/a&gt; with berries, oats, and chia seeds. The second is overnight oats, which he makes with milk, protein powder, berries, honey, nuts, and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="16694455-4bae-4acc-a454-c4db8f5516a8" data-toc-id="16694455-4bae-4acc-a454-c4db8f5516a8"&gt;Fiber cupboard&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hobson created a "fiber cupboard" in his kitchen that's packed with fibrous foods. He challenges himself to include something from the cupboard in every meal. "Then at least you know that you are making the effort to do it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stocks up on &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/3-ways-add-beans-meals-protein-fiber-private-chef-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lentils, beans, pulses&lt;/a&gt;, wholegrain pasta, brown rice, as well as snacks like fruit and nut bars, rye crackers that he likes to pair with some cottage cheese, and seaweed thins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm always rooting around for stuff, and I just think having it all in one place is so much easier," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8e599fc6-b8d1-4acf-8b7c-eeb1438c25f3" data-toc-id="8e599fc6-b8d1-4acf-8b7c-eeb1438c25f3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add pulses and legumes to your meal and put the rest into a Tupperware in the fridge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to add fiber to a meal is to pour half a can of beans or pulses into it, Hobson said. Just one &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/recipes-black-beans-to-reduce-inflammation-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cup of black beans&lt;/a&gt;, for example, contains 15 grams of fiber. "You can add them to anything," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix some into a soup, sauce, or curry, or simply sprinkle a couple of tablespoons on top of a salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're not using the whole can, decant the rest into a Tupperware and place it in the fridge, Hobson said. That way, they'll stay fresher for longer and be easily accessible. "Then you don't have to worry about, 'I'm going to waste the rest of the tin,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="140201b5-2f70-454c-af06-f674067ade72" data-toc-id="140201b5-2f70-454c-af06-f674067ade72"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep the food you want to eat visible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson recommends keeping the foods you want to eat in a visible spot. That way, you're more likely to reach for them. "Nuts and seeds, always keep them on the side so they're there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that the foods you keep on your countertop could impact your body weight, a factor that can influence cholesterol levels. In a 2015 study published in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1090198115610571" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Sage Journals&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at Cornell University analyzed the visible foods on 210 countertops in New York and measured their owners' BMIs. They found that those who had just fresh fruit visible weighed an average of 20 pounds less than those who had unhealthier snacks like candy, soda, and cereals on show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's your basic See-Food Diet — you eat what you see," Brian Wansink, the study's lead author, said of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you're not ready to make changes to your kitchen layout, Hobson said to stick to one basic principle: "Make sure that you've got a bit of fiber on your plate every day with every meal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

These blockages interfere with the brain's ability to clear harmful substances and may appear well before clear dementia symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clogged pathways are known as "enlarged perivascular spaces," and the findings suggest they could serve as an early warning signal for Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since these brain anomalies can be visually identified on routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed to evaluate cognitive decline, identifying them could complement existing methods to detect Alzheimer's earlier, without having to do and pay for additional tests," said Associate Professor Nagaendran Kandiah from NTU's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin Ong, a fifth-year LKCMedicine student and the study's first author, emphasized the importance of early detection. He noted that identifying Alzheimer's sooner gives doctors more time to intervene and potentially slow the progression of symptoms such as memory loss, reduced thinking speed, and mood changes. The research was conducted as part of LKCMedicine's Scholarly Project module in the School's Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Studying Asian Populations Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study stands out because it focuses on Asian populations, an area that has been underrepresented in Alzheimer's research. Most existing studies have concentrated on Caucasian participants, which may limit how broadly their findings apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NTU team examined nearly 1,000 people in Singapore from different ethnic backgrounds that reflect the country's population. Participants included individuals with normal cognitive function as well as those experiencing mild thinking difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that dementia does not affect all ethnic groups in the same way, making region specific studies essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For example, among Caucasians with dementia, past studies show that the prevalence of a major risk gene, apolipoprotein E4, linked to Alzheimer's is around 50 to 60 percent. But among Singapore dementia patients, it is less than 20 percent," said Assoc Prof Kandiah, who is also Director of the Dementia Research Centre (Singapore) in LKCMedicine. Because of these differences, findings in one population may not directly apply to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Brain Clears Toxic Waste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the brain, blood vessels are surrounded by small channels called perivascular spaces. These spaces help drain toxic waste products, including beta amyloid and tau proteins, which are found in high levels in people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the brain's waste removal system becomes less efficient, these spaces can enlarge and become visible on MRI scans. Until now, it was unclear whether this change was directly linked to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, the NTU researchers compared enlarged perivascular spaces with multiple established indicators of Alzheimer's. They also examined how these clogged drainage pathways relate to well known disease markers such as beta amyloid buildup and damage to the brain's white matter, the network of nerve fibers that connects different brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing Healthy Brains and Early Cognitive Decline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included nearly 350 participants with normal thinking abilities, including memory, reasoning, decision making, and focus. The remaining participants showed signs of early cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment, a condition that often precedes dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that people with mild cognitive impairment face a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, which is caused by reduced blood flow to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After analyzing MRI scans, the researchers found that participants with mild cognitive impairment were more likely to have enlarged perivascular spaces than those with no cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood Markers Strengthen the Link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to brain scans, the scientists measured seven Alzheimer's related biochemicals in participants' blood, including beta amyloid and tau proteins. Elevated levels of these substances are considered warning signs of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlarged perivascular spaces were linked to four of the seven biochemical measurements. This suggests that people with clogged brain drains are more likely to have increased amyloid plaques, tau tangles, and damage to brain cells, placing them at greater risk of developing Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at white matter damage, a widely used indicator of Alzheimer's, and found it was associated with six of the seven blood markers. However, further analysis revealed something unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among participants with mild cognitive impairment, the connection between Alzheimer's related biochemicals and enlarged perivascular spaces was stronger than the connection with white matter damage. This finding points to clogged brain drainage as a particularly early signal of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Diagnosis and Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These insights may help doctors make more informed decisions about early treatment strategies, potentially slowing disease progression before lasting brain damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The findings carry substantial clinical implications," said Assoc Prof Kandiah. "Although white matter damage is more widely used in clinical practice to evaluate for dementia, as it is easily recognised on MRI scans, our results suggest that enlarged perivascular spaces may hold unique value in detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rachel Cheong Chin Yee, a Senior Consultant and Deputy Head at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital's Department of Geriatric Medicine, said the study highlights the role of small blood vessel changes in Alzheimer's development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings are significant because they suggest that brain scans showing enlarged perivascular spaces could potentially help identify people at higher risk of Alzheimer's disease, even before symptoms appear," said Dr. Cheong, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking Brain Vessel Disease and Alzheimer's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chong Yao Feng, a Consultant at the National University Hospital's Division of Neurology who was also not involved in the study, noted that cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer's disease have traditionally been viewed as separate conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study's findings are intriguing as they demonstrate that both diseases do interact in a synergistic manner," said Dr. Chong, who is also a Clinical Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, doctors reviewing MRI scans should be cautious about assuming cognitive symptoms are caused only by blood vessel problems when markers such as enlarged perivascular spaces are present. These features may also signal a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Doctors will then have to use their clinical judgement of the patient's scan and symptoms, as well as discuss with the patient, to determine if more checks are needed to confirm whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease or not," said Dr. Chong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Comes Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NTU research team plans to track participants over time to determine how many eventually develop Alzheimer's dementia. This follow up will help confirm whether enlarged perivascular spaces can reliably predict progression to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If future studies in other populations reach similar conclusions, identifying clogged brain drains on MRI scans could become a routine tool for detecting Alzheimer's risk much earlier than is currently possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She explained their benefits and listed the key sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why should you eat fermented foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the dietician, fermented foods are packed with probiotics. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;They support beneficial gut bacteria and help maintain a healthy balance in the digestive system, while also facilitating key gut functions such as digestion and nutrient absorption.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;She also reminded that nearly 70 per cent of the immune system is linked to the gut, making it a critical line of defence against infections and inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But beyond digestive and immune health, gut microbes also influence brain activity, mood and emotional regulation through the gut-brain axis. Tehseen shared that when gut health is well-balanced, which fermented foods help achieve, brain functions such as mood, stress regulation, and sleep also improve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fermented food sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/05/02/original/bowl-with-yogurt-berries-high-angle_1746163634504.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Add fermented foods like unsweetened yoghurt to diet.

(Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adding fermented food to your diet is actually easy. The dietician disclosed that it does not have to be complicated. She shared, “Starting with small portions of unsweetened yoghurt, kefir, sauerkraut, fermented vegetables, or traditional foods like curd and buttermilk can be effective.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moreover, she revealed that fermented foods can be consumed by adding them to meals and smoothies. When consumed regularly, they help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, while also supporting digestion and immunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;Ever been about to pour rancid milk down the sink and thought…"Hmm, maybe I shouldn't…"? What about the tomato passata that's gone off? Or the water you washed the paint in? Or that pungent oil from a tuna can?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's consider the wisdom – or not – of putting everyday items down the plughole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they can cause problems by clogging or damaging pipes, creating health hazards and polluting the environment. And they add to the load on wastewater treatment plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where it goes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All indoor wastewater is carried through the sewer system. Everything flushed down the toilet or drained from the kitchen sink, bathtub, or shower connects to the same pipes within our home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-hidden-things-lurking-in-sink-drains-can-be-dangerous-even-deadly"&gt;The Hidden Things Lurking in Sink Drains Can Be Dangerous, Even Deadly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the water flows into the municipal sewer — the large pipes running beneath backyards or streets — and eventually flows to a wastewater treatment plant. Wastewater treatment plants have large aerated tanks full of bacteria that decompose the organic matter in wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chemical oxygen demand" measures how much oxygen is needed to break down organic matter. Every bit of additional matter – from passata to tuna oil – adds to the load. And a higher organic load requires greater aeration and larger tanks, thereby increasing the cost and complexity of operating a wastewater treatment plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/709827/original/file-20251219-56-e3dt6e.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;rect=0%2C281%2C6240%2C3510&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;(&lt;a class="source" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-group-of-metal-objects-7tZ006hSgKE"&gt;Mathias Reding/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"&gt;CC BY&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Spilt milk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you pour milk down the sink? Liquid dairy products, or any food item containing fat, oil and grease, including cooking oil, can &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/melbourne-afternoons/fatberg/105534992"&gt;block sewer pipes&lt;/a&gt;. When oil and grease mix with cool water in wastewater pipes, they harden. Then, they can combine with other waste, such as wet wipes, to form a rock-hard blockage known as a "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatberg"&gt;fatberg&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleaning such blockages is very expensive. For example, in the nine months up to July 2025, Sydney Water spent &lt;a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/this-is-why-water-utilities-want-you-to-water-your-plants-with-milk/4t2usuonc"&gt;A$12 million&lt;/a&gt; dealing with 11,805 "chokes" in the wastewater system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clogged sewers are not just a foul nuisance for the water industry — they are a problem that affects us all. They can trigger the release of raw and &lt;a href="https://www.sydneywater.com.au/water-the-environment/what-you-can-do/avoid-wastewater-overflows.html#:%7E:text=Something%20in%20the%20pipe%20is,contain%20a%20combination%20of%20these."&gt;untreated sewage&lt;/a&gt; into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/this-is-why-water-utilities-want-you-to-water-your-plants-with-milk/4t2usuonc"&gt;Sydney Water&lt;/a&gt; suggests people add water to old milk and pour it in moderation on plants, rather than into the sink. Alternatively, milk can be left in its container and put in your rubbish bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about the old and expired sauces, dips and gravy, which often lurk in the fridge at this time of year? These can be &lt;a href="https://www.calgary.ca/waste/what-goes-where/default.html"&gt;composted&lt;/a&gt; or runny sauces can be soaked up with newspaper or paper towels and put in the rubbish bin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chemicals like bleach or paint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a cleaning liquid such as bleach is approved to be sold in Australia, use it at the concentration specified on the container. But do not tip concentrated cleaning liquids &lt;a href="https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/Your-environment/Waste/industrial-waste/hazardous-and-liquid-wastes"&gt;into the sink&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pouring your remaining paint or paint-brush cleaning water into the sink is not a good idea. You risk potentially clogging the plumbing system – exposing yourselves to heavy fumes – and pouring flammable liquids down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need an alternative. You could use a disposable brush, or – if the paint job lasts multiple days – wrap the brush in plastic and only clean when done with painting. You can soak the small amount of brush water into an old towel and &lt;a href="https://www.bunnings.com.au/diy-advice/diy-skills/painting/how-to-safely-dispose-of-paint-products?srsltid=AfmBOoo-tpr0bLrU_4uK9MXixQeJaR-f7cciLNhP1VQvZ7JoyoSE8HUv"&gt;dispose&lt;/a&gt; of that in the rubbish bin once the paint has dried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the best way to get rid of potentially hazardous household chemicals such as paint, cleaners, pesticides, motor oil, or cooking oil, is to take them to a &lt;a href="https://www.epa.nsw.gov.au/Your-environment/Recycling-and-reuse/household-recycling-overview/household-chemical-cleanout"&gt;Household Chemical Cleanout&lt;/a&gt; event. These events are free services held in some &lt;a href="https://www.sustainability.vic.gov.au/recycling-and-reducing-waste-at-home/hazardous-household-chemicals/dispose-of-household-chemicals-detox-your-home"&gt;states and territories&lt;/a&gt; specified dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are industries that have funded their own collection schemes, for example, "&lt;a href="https://www.paintback.com.au/find-location"&gt;paintback&lt;/a&gt;" drop off centres. Commercial and industrial entities will need proper &lt;a href="https://recyclingnearyou.com.au/"&gt;recycling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/environment/water/Pages/wastewater.aspx"&gt;treatment processes&lt;/a&gt; in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Collective problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should not put anything down the sink that we would not want in our waterways. Instead of using sinks as disposal points, households should adopt safer alternatives such as composting food waste and taking hazardous substances to approved chemical cleanout events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not what one individual does, but what everyone in a city contributes together. Small individual actions, when combined across a city, make a significant difference in protecting plumbing infrastructure, public health, and our creeks and oceans.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269701/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Apple-pomegranate overnight oats are a delicious and nutritious breakfast option that combines the natural sweetness of apples and pomegranates with fiber-rich oats. The tartness of pomegranates complements the sweet, crisp flavor of apples. For the best flavor and sweetness, consider using sweet apple varieties such as Honeycrisp, Fuji or Gala.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The combination of prebiotic ingredients like oats, flaxmeal and dates makes these pumpkin overnight oats a delicious and nutritious option for supporting gut health. Dates add natural sweetness, while yogurt adds tang as well as a healthy dose of probiotics to start your day off right.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Start your day with a breakfast that feels like a treat—these layered overnight oats offer a delightful blend of banana, cinnamon and a touch of vanilla to elevate the taste. Right before enjoying, a finishing touch of crumbled graham crackers adds a pie-like charm to this easy breakfast. For the best results, use ripe bananas—their skin should be brown in spots and they should feel a little soft when you squeeze them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This easy, meal-prep-friendly recipe takes all the flavors of a caramel apple and imparts them into breakfast. Applesauce ensures the texture is creamy yet light while also providing balance to the sweet-tart flavor of the oats. If you don’t have Granny Smith apples on hand, Fuji, Gala or Honeycrisp apples work as well. Crushed honey-roasted peanuts mimic the coating of a caramel apple, but any salty-sweet nut would be delicious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These overnight steel-cut oats are the ultimate make-ahead breakfast. Make a batch for the whole family, or store the extra servings in the fridge to eat throughout the week. We love these creamy steel-cut oats topped with honey, bananas and raspberries, but any sweetener, chopped fruit or nut topping will work well.

You can substitute any nondairy milk for the reduced-fat milk, or try kefir if you want your oats extra tangy.
