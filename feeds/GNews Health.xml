&lt;p&gt;In a recent segment on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/nausea-widowmaker-heart-attack-symptom-women-rcna136801" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;the “Today” show&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://drchantrise.com/about/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Chantrise Holliman&lt;/a&gt;, a mother, wife and heart health educator based in Georgia,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shared the story of her &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/topic/heart-attack" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; and what seemed like the fairly benign symptoms that accompanied it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliman experienced nausea, vomiting and mild chest pressure. The first two symptoms ― which aren’t commonly associated with heart attacks ― led her to believe the sensations had more to do with her dinner the night before than a serious medical concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Holliman, many people don’t know that stomach symptoms can, indeed, be signs of a heart attack. While not the most common warning sign (chest pain is most reported), nausea is also not uncommon during a cardiac event, according to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1316106776/sean-p-heffron" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Sean Heffron&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at NYU Langone Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “tends to depend somewhat on which blood vessel in the heart is affected,” Heffron explained. Additionally, nausea is more commonly seen in women, Heffron said, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/heart_attack.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;as is vomiting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other heart attack signs in women include jaw pain, neck pain, a dull feeling of chest discomfort, upper abdomen pain, back pain and excessive tiredness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to hear stories like this, because many women think it has to be like, ‘I’m clutching my chest and falling to the ground like you see in the movies,’ and it can be much more subtle,” Dr. Tara Narula, a cardiologist and NBC News medical contributor, &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/nausea-widowmaker-heart-attack-symptom-women-rcna136801" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888385" data-affiliate="true"&gt;told “Today.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks can look very different in women than in men, which means that sufferers and doctors alike sometimes dismiss them. But it’s important to recognize the signs, especially since heart disease “is the leading cause of death for women in this country,” Narula told “Today.” “One woman every 80 seconds dies of cardiovascular disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to tell if your nausea is part of a heart attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that several nutrients are linked with a lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These nutrients include vitamins and minerals that act as antioxidants, plus fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High sugar intake was related to an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, it’s natural to become more forgetful. But when the occasional “Where did I leave my keys?” becomes forgetting loved ones’ names and your own address, it may be a sign of something more serious. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is a general term for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loss of memory&lt;/a&gt;, language, problem-solving and other thinking abilities, severe enough to interfere with everyday life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893378/these-13-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-alzheimers-according-to-a-new-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is the most common type of dementia. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dementia cases are expected to double&lt;/a&gt; by the year 2060. And the economic burden of unpaid dementia caregiving in the U.S. is expected to skyrocket from an average of $172 billion in 2020 to over $1.5 trillion by 2060.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And this doesn’t take into account the emotional toll on families, friends and caregivers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since there is currently no cure for dementia, taking &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/activity-to-limit-for-reduced-risk-dementia-8548330" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;preventative measures&lt;/a&gt; can be a wise move. Columbia University researchers wanted to know which nutrients were related to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-factors-reduce-early-dementia-risk-new-study-8423035" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduced risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;—and which ones might increase the risk. They recently published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing U.S. study conducted biennially since 1992 that includes adults 50 years and older. In 2013, food consumption and nutrition intake was collected from a subset of the HRS called the Healthcare and Nutrition Study (HCNS).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate diet, participants completed a food frequency questionnaire that asked how frequently they consumed 163 different foods and beverages over the past 12 months. From this, the research team calculated nutrient intake based on participants’ responses for 101 nutrients. Individual nutrients were assessed regarding their relationship to dementia. In addition, researchers calculated composite scores for some groups of nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants’ cognitive abilities were assessed using two different methods. One method was via a telephone interview with participants and the other was via a proxy respondent. For the proxy method, someone close to the participant answered questions about the participant’s memory levels, limitations in instrumental activities of daily living and status of cognitive impairment. Researchers would use this information to look for associations between nutrient intake and dementia risk.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This current study included 6,280 HCNS participants who met the researchers’ criteria, which included full diet information and cognitive assessments. Researchers also adjusted for demographic information like age, race, sex, BMI, education level, smoking status, alcohol intake and physical activity.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running statistical analyses, the results suggest that several nutrients were connected with a reduced risk of dementia. The five with the strongest association were:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Isorhamnetin, a type of flavonol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manganese, a mineral&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary fiber&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta-tocopherol and beta-tocotrienol, both forms of vitamin E&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also adds to the mounting evidence that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-eating-too-much-sugar-11721349" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high sugar intake&lt;/a&gt; is linked with a higher risk of dementia.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With that said, it also showed some controversial associations between some other nutrients and higher dementia risk. We say controversial because they conflict with previous research or add to mixed results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, this study suggests a link between certain components in milk and an increased risk of dementia, including glycerophosphocholine and vitamin D, both of which have been shown to support brain health in other studies. Researchers note that more research needs to be done, and that it could be due to other components in the food, not necessarily these nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has several limitations. First, asking people to estimate how much they ate of certain foods over the last year leaves lots of room for bias, forgetfulness and guessing. Also, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7903274/7-sneaky-signs-you-could-have-cognitive-decline-according-to-experts/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive abilities and dementia&lt;/a&gt; were not clinically evaluated, which also leaves room for bias. Lastly, researchers did not adjust for factors like genetics and environmental factors that play a role in dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Isorhamnetin is a flavonol found in fruits and vegetables, including onions, almonds, berries, cherries, pears, apples and green grapes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s also found in ginkgo biloba, an herb touted for its brain health benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You’ll find manganese in nuts, legumes, whole grains and leafy greens. Maple syrup and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676558/what-is-maple-water-and-should-you-be-drinking-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maple water&lt;/a&gt; are also rich sources of this trace mineral. Manganese plays a role in many bodily processes, including metabolism and immunity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While it’s a mineral, manganese plays a dual role and acts like an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage from free radicals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like manganese, vitamin E also has antioxidant properties, protecting cells from damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and sunflower and safflower oils are good sources of vitamin E. You’ll also get some in spinach and broccoli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A whopping &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nine out of 10 Americans&lt;/a&gt; don’t have enough fiber in their diets. Fiber-rich foods include fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re concerned that you’re not including enough of these nutrients in your day-to-day routine, consider shaking things up. An easy (and painless) way to do it is to swap out your typical snacks for nutrient-rich ones. For example, if you typically reach for chips, soda or a candy bar mid-afternoon, consider a handful of nuts and berries. Or how about some hummus and veggie sticks? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The MIND diet is a fusion of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, and is loaded with brain-healthy foods that are also good for your heart. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-dementia-study-11748383" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;There is recent evidence&lt;/a&gt; that following this healthy eating pattern may reduce your risk of dementia by up to 25%.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to food, physical activity, managing your stressors and getting plenty of quality sleep also influence brain health. And make sure you’re also spending time with loved ones, as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/loneliness-dementia-risk-study-8733921" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;loneliness has also been shown to increase dementia &lt;/a&gt;risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that certain nutrients, like vitamin E, manganese and isorhamnetin, all of which act like antioxidants, plus fiber, are linked with a lower risk of dementia. It also adds to existing evidence that high sugar intake may raise dementia risk. If possible, get these brain-protecting nutrients from food. If you have difficulty doing so, seek the advice of a registered dietitian or a healthcare professional who can help you integrate foods rich in these nutrients and determine if supplementation is a viable option for you.

&lt;p&gt;The unidentified resident returned from a recent trip to Europe with measles, becoming the state’s 15th case this year, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spike in measles cases in Colorado, the most the state has recorded in decades, comes after a deadly outbreak in Texas this year, and as other hot spots have emerged around the world for the highly contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infected Boulder County resident was an adult who was fully vaccinated, health officials said. Two shots of the vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials say people should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days — and consider avoiding public gatherings — if they visited the following exposure locations in Boulder and Denver:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RTD Flatiron Flyer between Denver and Boulder&lt;/strong&gt;, both ways, from 6:45 to 9:35 a.m. and 4:05 to 7:15 p.m. June 3, June 5 and June 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Building&lt;/strong&gt;, 1400 16th St., Denver, from 8 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. June 3-6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Little Finch Coffee Shop&lt;/strong&gt;, 1490 16th St., Denver, from noon to 2:15 p.m. June 4 and June 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Foods&lt;/strong&gt;, 1701 Wewatta St., Denver, from noon to 2:30 p.m. June 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosetta Hall&lt;/strong&gt;, 1109 Walnut St., Boulder, from 7:30 to 10:45 p.m. June 6.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms include a cough, runny nose, red eyes and a fever, with a red rash starting about four days after someone becomes contagious. People can begin to feel sick one to three weeks after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who feel ill after a possible exposure should call their health care provider or an urgent care center before seeking help, so the provider can reduce the risk the virus will spread to other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has recorded at least eight measles cases tied to Denver International Airport and a Turkish Airlines flight that landed there with a contagious passenger on May 13. Other cases have been confirmed in Denver, Pueblo and Archuleta County.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;In a typical year, Colorado has two or fewer measles cases. The last time the state recorded more than 10 in a year was in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;

That much smaller Y chromosome carries the SRY gene, which is the switch for testis development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 300 million years or so, this system has been working very well. Now, however, chatter in genetics circles hints that something is amiss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, the Y chromosome has been losing pieces of itself, and computer models suggest the last scraps could vanish in roughly 11 million years. This is no trivial matter, because what it holds – or drops – can sway everything from cancer risk to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mouse-with-two-dads-survives-to-adulthood-major-implications-for-same-sex-human-couples/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;how future humans reproduce&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would that erase men from the planet, or would life simply shrug and invent a new plan? Rodents on remote islands and subtle changes inside aging human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blood-stem-cells-grown-in-the-lab-for-first-time-ever-leukemia-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone marrow&lt;/a&gt; are now providing clues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One story shows how a mammal kept producing males after its Y disappeared entirely. The other warns how men already pay a price when some of their cells drift away from the chromosome during middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-y-chromosome-fade-away"&gt;Y chromosome fade away&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mothers-pass-down-x-chromosomes-that-accelerate-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The X chromosome&lt;/a&gt; carries about 900 genes that do everything from wiring nerves to repairing DNA. Its partner, the Y, keeps only about 55. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparative work across mammals shows that, once our lineage split from the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-do-animals-balance-their-sex-chromosomes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;platypus&lt;/a&gt; some 166 million years ago, the Y began dropping about five genes every million years. Run that line forward, and the ledger hits zero in 11 million years – a geological heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most biologists once chalked that outcome up to hype. After all, many species never shed their sex chromosomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the idea gained traction when researchers found the Japanese spiny rat and a few mole vole species thriving today without any Y at all. Somehow, they had rewired the traditional circuit for making testes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rodents-changed-the-rules"&gt;Rodents changed the rules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, scientists found a duplicated piece of DNA near a gene called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/sox9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SOX9&lt;/a&gt; in the spiny rat. Usually, another gene (SRY) turns SOX9 on to make male traits develop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in this rat, the new DNA copy does that job on its own – even without a Y chromosome – so a genetically female animal (XX) can still develop as male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the fragment into lab mice and testes still form. Evolution, it seems, can lay a new cable when the old one burns out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That discovery hints that, should the human Y fizzle out one distant day, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/lifes-rules-natural-selection-change-significantly-often-daphnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural selection&lt;/a&gt; could promote an alternative trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different populations might even settle on different triggers, eventually splitting into separate species that cannot interbreed. The idea sounds like science fiction, but the rodent reality shows it is genetically feasible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-y-chromosomes-and-men-s-health"&gt;Y chromosomes and men’s health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before any species-wide overhaul, countless men are already losing the Y chromosome cell by cell. Starting in their fifties, bone-marrow &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/living-mouse-created-with-stem-cells-that-predate-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; sometimes mis-segregate it during division. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting white-blood-cell lineages, missing their Y, multiply quietly. By 80 years old, more than 40 percent of men carry sizable pockets of this “mosaic loss of Y” in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking 1,153 Swedish men in their seventies and eighties, researchers found that those with the loss died 5.5 years earlier, suffered more solid tumors and heart disease, and faced a seven-fold rise in Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Walsh of the &lt;a href="https://www.virginia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/a&gt; then bred mouse blood stem cells without the Y chromosome and transplanted them. The recipients developed fibrosis, failing hearts, and early death, showing the loss is the culprit, not a bystander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-direct-link-to-the-immune-system"&gt;Direct link to the immune system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gene on the Y chromosome called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UTY&lt;/a&gt; helps control the immune system. Without it, some immune cells stop working properly – one kind makes more scar tissue, and another becomes weaker, which helps cancer grow and spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, tumors grow twice as fast without the Y. In men, bladder cancers missing the Y chromosome are more dangerous – except they respond better to a certain kind of cancer treatment called checkpoint inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture is complicated: a chromosome that underpins male development also tames inflammation and restrains tumors, yet its selective absence can make some drugs shine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicine and evolution rarely share the same bottom line. Natural selection prizes reproductive success over a lifetime, while clinicians care about the here and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-offsetting-y-chromosome-loss"&gt;Offsetting Y chromosome loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-vaping-help-people-quit-smoking-cigarettes-new-study-breaks-it-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cigarette smoke&lt;/a&gt;, air pollution, and certain industrial chemicals add extra DNA damage and accelerate the Y chromosome loss. Kicking tobacco, breathing cleaner air, and limiting exposure to mutagens therefore rank as simple defenses – all it takes is willpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General habits that slow genomic wear – regular exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mediterranean-diet-may-be-a-fountain-of-youth-for-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mediterranean-style&lt;/a&gt; meals, and solid sleep – may also keep the Y chromosome in more cells for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antifibrotic drugs cleared for lung disease are being tested to blunt heart damage from the loss. Oncologists already use chromosome status in bladder tumors to steer checkpoint therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As single-cell sequencing gets cheaper, your physical exam might soon include a “Y-loss score” beside cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-do-we-go-from-here"&gt;Where do we go from here?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese spiny rat proves that mammals can reinvent the rulebook after the ‘puny little chromosome’ disappears. That prospect keeps evolutionary biologists buzzing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the rodent’s triumph offers little comfort to a 60-year-old man whose marrow has already shed Y in a third of his white-blood-cell army. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Species-level salvation and individual-level hazard can coexist. That dichotomy – long-term adaptability versus immediate personal cost – will likely guide both medical practice and evolutionary debate in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Y chromosome is quirky but crucial. It shapes male development, steadies immunity, and may also be plotting its own disappearance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the good news is that the practical advice is simple: dodge mutagens, stub out cigarettes, consider a mid-life test for loss, and keep an eye on new research as this chromosome writes its final chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go, men, you got this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(23)00646-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 21:55:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPaHBHVUVBUVJoMU5NODVHOGRiMGhSZDBEd2Zrak5rYzVVX0lGOGNlMHloWlhBSGhzamRRZXJtS1M5cU9UM3RGSE9wM0NHWDRZYnZPR3dQRUZ0YVlyTFVqcVdSM0dEUGxpT25LMFh5N2tPVGZDUGp1elJmYjZXMnQybTR4NlJUd3k2d2tnbDloN3Y5TVR1XzZ6bWg0cjM</guid></item><item><title>随着卫生官员呼吁美国支持， Mpox在塞拉利昂飙升-《纽约时报》 | Mpox Surges in Sierra Leone as Health Officials Appeal for U.S. Support - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNZFI2Y1RZcnlxTDVubzVSMWVOR1hnOTRpekIxSWdUV3hDcm8wdWh5amJKVUpiVjZ2LVU2WmlQT1RsUFNGc2dCcW5oZEhhRWxVM284S3NZLWFTdldFbmdqaXdjVTBsTTBCM19OSVNsVTZfcTRCUnlIcFczenBVdS10djBDMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 20:45:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNZFI2Y1RZcnlxTDVubzVSMWVOR1hnOTRpekIxSWdUV3hDcm8wdWh5amJKVUpiVjZ2LVU2WmlQT1RsUFNGc2dCcW5oZEhhRWxVM284S3NZLWFTdldFbmdqaXdjVTBsTTBCM19OSVNsVTZfcTRCUnlIcFczenBVdS10djBDMA</guid></item><item><title>专家说，肯尼迪的HHS派国会“垃圾科学”来捍卫疫苗的变化- CNN | Kennedy’s HHS sent Congress ‘junk science’ to defend vaccine changes, experts say - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5TbnlwUWpFZlZYbHVOSEg2dHlyTHQ2UWVqRVpxWlYyRTUtSHMwQ3VtcExTd3ptclpWdS1JUXpiSzVQS2tGSGZ6bVZBV05ZeVBVMXJ0N0ItMkxGdWM5R3BTeFptcVBGVE5pR0dTSGJfXzE0RU9jNlZyYjB6ckI1M0nSAYQBQVVfeXFMTWlNbXNEckRFbkhMTE9tWHlJWklYbFdzcm1DX19mSFZhc1YwUGgyUVBfUFZ6SUZTbXExMVFwS1pDblhaWUJJT3hjVWFibGgxTU5SU29lT1lLRldDMkt4MF90cG1YQUlmcmI1M084ZXhNcmlpbUc3TUFuNE1oeFBVdWtWanYx?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A document the Department of Health and Human Services sent to lawmakers to support Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to change U.S. policy on covid vaccines cites scientific studies that are unpublished or under dispute and mischaracterizes others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            One health expert called the document “willful medical disinformation” about the safety of covid vaccines for children and pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It is so far out of left field that I find it insulting to our members of Congress that they would actually give them something like this. Congress members are relying on these agencies to provide them with valid information, and it’s just not there,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/mark-turrentine-32066" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Turrentine&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine.

            Kennedy, who was an anti-vaccine activist before taking a role in the Trump administration, announced May 27 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer recommend covid vaccines for pregnant women or healthy children, bypassing the agency’s formal process for adjusting its vaccine schedules for adults and kids. The announcement, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;made on the social platform X&lt;/a&gt;, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The HHS document meant to support Kennedy’s decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress who questioned the science and process behind his move, according to one federal official who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy’s announcement from the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Titled “Covid Recommendation FAQ,” the document distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished, medical experts say.

            HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News, “There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Under the study’s title is an alert that “it reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.” Though the preprint was made available a year ago, it has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000l3b6mexy48umn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The FAQ supporting Kennedy’s decision claims that “post-marketing studies” of covid vaccines have identified “serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis” — conditions in which the heart’s muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000m3b6mytcf69j1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            False claims that the 2024 preprint showed myocarditis and pericarditis only in people who received a covid vaccine, and not in people infected with covid, circulated on social media. One of the &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/08/myocarditis-vaccinated-covid-19-oxford-fact-check/74639942007/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;study’s co-authors&lt;/a&gt; publicly rejected that idea, because the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the covid virus. The study also focused only on children and adolescents. The HHS document omitted numerous &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39826014/" target="_blank"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39404761/" target="_blank"&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35993236/" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have shown that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis is greater after contracting covid for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000n3b6m5va2ty2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            O’Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the covid pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of covid vaccines were spaced further apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000o3b6m8x16x1hx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O’Leary said, referring to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/vsd/index.html#cdc_generic_section_5-access-and-use-vsd-data" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Safety Datalink&lt;/a&gt;. “There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify,” he said.

            In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims that are &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17721" target="_blank"&gt;actively refuted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2022/04000/in_vitro_fertilization_and_early_pregnancy.3.aspx%C2%A0" target="_blank"&gt;the papers&lt;/a&gt; it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of covid vaccines for pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The HHS document says that another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24001270?via%3Dihub#s0090" target="_blank"&gt;paper it cites&lt;/a&gt; found “an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine.” But the paper doesn’t contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I’ve now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere,” said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000s3b6m7rkrmviu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If he were grading the HHS document, “I would give this an ‘F,’” Turrentine said. “This is not supported by anything and it’s not using medical evidence.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000t3b6mahkdmtpe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/neil-silverman" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Silverman,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. “They’re going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document,” Silverman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Schrier’s office did receive a copy of the document.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000v3b6m04p2ohkp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don’t have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart,” O’Leary said. “But this one — I’ve seen much better anti-vaccine propaganda than this, frankly.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000w3b6mwahzdy4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration’s policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000x3b6mxxuyaefn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This feels like it’s breaking new ground. I don’t think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration,” Young said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            On June 4, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Schrier &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr3701/BILLS-119hr3701ih.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; that would require Kennedy to adopt official vaccine decisions from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Young said the motivation behind the bill was Kennedy’s decision to change the covid vaccine schedule without the input of ACIP’s vaccine experts, who play a key role in setting CDC policies around vaccine schedules and access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbv64d1k000z3b6mkvy7hltk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy announced June 9 on X that he would remove all 17 members of ACIP, citing alleged conflicts of interest he did not detail, and replace them. He announced eight replacements June 11, including people who had criticized vaccine mandates during the covid pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

I asked if he could feel it, if he was doing anything to make it twitch, but he said no,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spasms progressed for Albaladejo and he soon experienced arm weakness, difficulty gripping things, and high blood pressure, &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.newsweek.com/silly-little-symptom-leads-als-diagnosis-2083556?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawK5DRlleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFNUG40ZWN2eG9uVmJDSFFzAR4GYdlcSt9DsIH1gC5T3EZCSbd3f9-elZ3QsLIAmEvjc_Me_P2lo0dGdQHBeA_aem_BmKQCgWPBSYsySYL3Yg2tA#Echobox=1749744873" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Newsweek;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; reported. Within months, doctors diagnosed him with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, a condition that causes progressive &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:loss of muscle control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;loss of muscle control&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was heartbroken when I heard the news, like my life was being taken from me piece by piece – I still have so much of me to give,” he told DM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hearing the diagnosis was devastating, we were in complete shock,” Carmen said to Newsweek. “Sitting in that doctor's office, the weight of it all hit us at once. We broke down in tears. It was one of the hardest moments of our lives, filled with fear, sorrow, and so many unanswered questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Physical therapy (stock photo).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALS symptoms can include difficulty walking, tripping, and slurred speech, among others, and it often first appears in the hands, feet, arms, or legs, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. There is no cure, but medical treatment can slow the disease's progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life changed in an instant for Albaladejo, who used to work as a school resource officer, and he worried about his family’s future, including his 11-year-old daughter Sophia. He was 39 years old when he received the diagnosis in late 2023, according to Newsweek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm angry that I won't be here to see my little girl grow into the smart, kind, and beautiful woman I know she will be. I think that hurts the most,” Albaladejo said. “Instead, she has to watch me fall apart in front of her eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he wants to leave a legacy she can be proud of.  “I just hope that throughout all of this, my daughter still sees me as her hero, as I face this disease with determination and strength,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily life in Tampa has shifted drastically for the couple, who &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@calbaladej0/photo/7402335127734390062" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:started dating;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;started dating&lt;/a&gt; when they were teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In eight months, our lives completely changed.

If someone opts for the $600 FIT with DNA screening, which checks for abnormal changes in cells' DNA, accuracy rises to 92 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is about 99 percent accurate at detecting all cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study found people that use the FIT method between the ages of 40 to 49 years old are 39 percent less likely to die from colon cancer than their peers who wait to get the test until they are 50 years old or above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An increasing number of younger people are seeking screening, as the US experiences a&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14797635/colon-cancer-young-people-symptoms.html"&gt;surge in colon cancer among people under 50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, with young patients today about twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease than their grandparents.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Christine Bronstein who was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 48 years after taking an at-home stool-based test for the disease. She said without the test, her cancer may have gone unnoticed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rising rates are prompting some physicians to urge Americans to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14766779/colon-cancer-screening-age-lowered-cases-surge.html"&gt;start getting screened for the disease &lt;/a&gt;before the age of 45 years, which is when US doctors recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the test, which can be ordered online, customers are sent a package containing a collection tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are asked to collect a sample of their feces from the toilet bowl, place it in the tube and mail it to a lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results take about five days to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the lab, scientists expose the feces to antibodies that can bind to human hemoglobin - a protein found in red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If they bind to an area of the feces, a positive test result is issued - and patients are advised to undertake further screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the FIT with DNA, scientists also analyze cells found in the stool for abnormal changes - which could indicate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients over 45 years old who have an average risk — meaning no family history of the disease — may be recommended the test, which is free for the group under health insurance plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But people can also buy the test, which is sold by labs like Everlywell for $49, or opt for other tests like Cologuard, which is priced at $121.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the test can be extremely helpful, doctors caution that about five to 10 percent of patients who get a positive result do not have colon cancer or advanced polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of false positives after a colonoscopy is below one percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is important to follow up with a doctor to discuss results.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with stage three cancer following the test, and a two-inch tumor was found in her rectum.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients undertaking the test are recommended to do it every year, as this can help to catch early-onset cancers which are typically slower growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among patients to have their cancer caught after using an at-home stool-based test is Christine Bronstein, who was diagnosed with the cancer at age 48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Hawaii local exercises regularly, and avoids sugar and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after seeing blood in her stool in 2021, she became concerned and ordered a stool-based test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After results came back positive, she rushed to see her doctor and was eventually approved for a colonoscopy - which led to a stage three colon cancer diagnosis with a two-inch tumor found in her rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bronstein told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/health/colorectal-cancer-survivor-home-test-rcna25564"&gt;TODAY&lt;/a&gt;: 'I'm very lucky that I did my test when I did. This thing really takes people down right in their prime... I think the problem why this is becoming the No.1 killer for younger people is because their symptoms get denied.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer cases are surging among under-50s in the US in an uptick that has stunned researchers, with adults born in the 1980s having double the risk of suffering from the cancer compared to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among adults aged 25 to 29 years, colon cancer cancer rates have spiked 85 percent in two decades according to CDC data. At the same time, over the last 30 years cases have dropped among over-50s by 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The program aims to offer therapeutic support in a safe, medically supervised setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now open to the public following a soft launch earlier this year, this &lt;a href="https://ambio.life/personal-change/ibogaine-regeneration/"&gt;neuroregenerative program&lt;/a&gt; is designed for patients considering ibogaine as part of their care strategy. It has already treated 30 patients in a dedicated treatment facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to MS, the program is available for people with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/what-is-als/"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions. The goal is to explore ibogaine as a potential supportive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re creating a safe, structured environment for people with these conditions to explore ibogaine, and we could be on the cusp of uncovering how ibogaine may support brain healing in ways we don’t fully understand today,” Jonathan Dickinson, Ambio’s CEO and co-founder, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/06/09/3095856/0/en/Ambio-Life-Sciences-Launches-World-s-First-Clinical-Ibogaine-Program-for-Patients-With-Neurodegenerative-Conditions.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Lesion volume reduced, symptoms eased in 2 patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, damage to the brain and spinal cord results in a wide range of symptoms, including vision problems, poor coordination and balance, fatigue, and pain. Available treatments can prevent new damage from occurring and slow down the progression of disease, but they generally cannot help patients regain lost functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ibogaine, currently illegal in the U.S., is a psychedelic found in the root bark of the African iboga plant. It works by acting on receptors — for example, NMDA and opioid receptors — that play a role in brain activity. Ibogaine also increases the production of molecules that help nerve cells survive and form new connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;As both a clinician and an MS patient, I’ve experienced the complexity of these conditions and the limitations of traditional treatments. The relief some patients are reporting so far is motivating, including improvements in eyesight, mobility, and neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1535782/full"&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt;, ibogaine reduced lesion volume and eased symptoms of MS in two patients — one with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing–remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; and the other with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/secondary-progressive-multiple-sclerosis-spms/"&gt;secondary progressive MS&lt;/a&gt;. Following treatment, both patients also showed signs of improvement on brain scans suggestive of new connections between nerve cells and rewiring of brain circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As both a clinician and an MS patient, I’ve experienced the complexity of these conditions and the limitations of traditional treatments,” Lyndsey Ryan, Ambio’s chief therapy officer, said. “The relief some patients are reporting so far is motivating, including improvements in eyesight, mobility, and neuropathic pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ambio’s program, a loading dosing is optimized for tolerability, followed by extended microdosing (taking very small doses). Weekly group sessions offer ongoing support through and beyond the treatment period. In addition to providing safe access to ibogaine, the company will also collect real-world data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the program does not promise a cure, it gives patients a chance to participate in an emerging therapy that could support better quality of life and provide insights for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every participant is helping us learn what’s possible,” said Ryan, who is also the program’s lead therapist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Ibogaine relived ‘MS hug’ for patient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country music artist Clay Walker and NFL Hall of Famer Brett Favre were among the first to try the program. Both were diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases — Walker with MS in 1996, and Favre with Parkinson’s in early 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was told about ibogaine from a friend who completed the treatment and was blown away by the results,” said Favre. “Since coming to Ambio, I’ve felt a real shift, especially in my sleep and energy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walker shared a similar experience. “My journey with ibogaine was extraordinary,” Walker said. “It relieved what we call the ‘&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/the-ms-hug/"&gt;MS hug&lt;/a&gt;,’ that painful tightness in the abdomen, and gave me clarity, focus, and real relief from stress. My hope is that ibogaine can one day complement the treatments MS patients already rely on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambio is working with Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, to explore how ibogaine works in people with neurodegenerative diseases, namely how it impacts biomarkers of neuroinflammation and disease models of Parkinson’s, MS, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This work may help define what ibogaine treatments for neurodegenerative diseases could look like in the future,” Dickinson said. “Even if we don’t fully know what shape that will take yet, preclinical research and each patient’s experience brings us closer to understanding how ibogaine may support neurorepair.”&lt;/p&gt;

As Sarah tells PEOPLE, her husband, David, was about to give him the medication, which they’d picked up from Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy in Comox, B.C., on May 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's very chaotic in the morning, and if my husband had just been distracted with the other two, or been tired from being up with the baby the night before, this could have ended totally differently," Sarah, who has a 3-year-old and 10-month-old, tells PEOPLE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty; Joe Amon/The Denver Post via Getty&lt;/p&gt; (Left:) Dextroamphetamine; (Right:) Hydromorphone&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when David looked at the bottle, and realized he was holding someone else’s prescription — and it was for hydromorphone.

&lt;p&gt;Dental implants have gotten much better, but they still just sit there, in your mouth, like polished pegs. Your real teeth — you can feel them chatter, grind, and push onto stuff. When you chew, you feel it with your tiny nerve endings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, this sensory feedback — known as dental proprioception — has been lost to implants. Until now. A team from Tufts University has just unveiled a bioengineered dental implant that doesn’t just fill the gap but also blends in with your sensory connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-750x600.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1140x912.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" type="image/webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1024x819.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1536x1229.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-2048x1639.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-750x600.jpg 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/kamal-hoseinianzade-s5TU52ZjaFA-unsplash-1140x912.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" class="wp-image-285357 sp-no-webp" alt="teeth" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async"&gt; &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Teeth implants could use stem cells and connect to nerve endings inside your mouth. Image credits: Kamal Hoseinianzade.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, let’s get something straight: traditional implants are mechanical marvels. Typically made of titanium and topped with ceramic, they’re surgically anchored directly into your jawbone. Once healed, they stay put for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here’s the problem: in anchoring directly to the bone, implants bypass the soft tissue that naturally connects real teeth to your jaw. That soft tissue — the periodontal ligament — is loaded with nerve endings. It lets you feel the difference between a walnut and a jellybean. Lose it, and you lose that whisper of feedback that makes chewing precise and speech fluid. It’s a bit like having &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="2305" href="https://www.zmescience.com/future/ai-headphones-focusing/"&gt;noise-cancelling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers want to bring back the feel of &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/researchers-develop-new-coating-that-could-remove-teeth-stains-more-effectively/"&gt;real teeth&lt;/a&gt; with a new generation of implants. They’ve designed an implant wrapped in a biodegradable, memory-foam-like nanofiber coating. Inside that coating are stem cells and a potent growth protein (FGF-2). This protein nudges those cells to become nerve tissue and directs the implant to grow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea is to re-create the missing nerve link — the feedback loop that once kept your bite in sync. But the team didn’t stop at making the implant feel more natural. They changed how it’s installed, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-changing-dental-implants"&gt;Changing dental implants&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional implants require drilling into the jawbone — a procedure that is painful, can damage nerves, and takes months to fully heal. The Tufts implant, by contrast, uses a “press-fit” technique. Think of it like inserting a memory foam plug: it goes in smaller than the space it’s meant to fill, then slowly expands to snugly match the contours of the socket. You don’t need any drills and there’s less trauma involved with the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, the method has only been tested on rats, not on humans. Six weeks after the implants were installed, they were still secure and showed no sign of rejection. &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/how-water-filters-age/" data-wpil-monitor-id="2304"&gt;Micro-CT scans&lt;/a&gt; showed that a tiny, uniform gap (0.7–0.9 mm) exists between the implant and the surrounding bone. Instead of fusing directly to bone like traditional implants, these sit within a soft-tissue pocket. That’s the magic: that soft-tissue layer is where the nerve connections are expected to grow back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step is to see if those newly grown nerves actually &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; — by measuring &lt;a data-wpil-monitor-id="2303" href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/brain-solves-problems-when-we-daydream/"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; in response to bite pressure or temperature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If that checks out, the team plans to move on to larger animal models — likely pigs or dogs, which have more &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/fossil-friday-the-story-of-how-tusks-evolved-from-teeth/"&gt;human-like teeth&lt;/a&gt; — and eventually clinical trials in humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-game-changer-for-dentistry"&gt;A game changer for dentistry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect to see this technology pop up at a dentist near you in a year or two. But if this does work, it could be a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About 178 million Americans are missing at least one tooth. By 2026, nearly a quarter of the U.S. population is expected to have at least one dental implant. Worldwide, the implant industry is projected to top $13 billion. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new implants are not just about comfort, either. Without proprioception, patients often bite harder than they need to, risking fractures or jaw issues. Subtle speech changes can occur. The feedback loop between jaw muscles, teeth, and brain is broken. And we’re only beginning to understand how that affects digestion, eating behavior, and long-term oral health. Some researchers even link impaired oral sensation to changes in brain regions tied to speech, swallowing, and memory. It’s a frontier in neuroscience and prosthodontics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the only exciting discovery in the field. In Japan, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/the-first-drug-that-regrows-teeth-is-about-to-enter-clinical-trials/"&gt;have made progress&lt;/a&gt; on regrowing human teeth. Another approach aims to &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/human-like-teeth-grown-in-pigs-could-make-dental-implants-a-thing-of-the-past/"&gt;regrow human teeth in pigs&lt;/a&gt;. But these approaches will take quite some time to develop as well, if they turn out to be successful at all. In the meantime, it looks like we’ll still be using implants for some time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These implants may soon become much more than just plumbing and scaffolding. They will be part of a sensing, communicating, adapting system. This smart implant doesn’t just restore function — it tries to connect an implant to the body. Literally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99923-8"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They play essential roles in biology, industry, and environmental processes.&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;acid&lt;/span&gt; prevents artery spasms by working through two distinct mechanisms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sudden narrowing of the coronary arteries, known as coronary artery spasms, can cause chest pain (angina), heart attacks, and other serious cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Dr. Kento Yoshioka, Dr. Keisuke Obara, and Professor Yoshio Tanaka from the Department of Chemical Pharmacology at Toho University’s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences has discovered that ferulic acid, a natural compound found in rice, coffee, and certain vegetables, can help prevent these spasms through two separate mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Discovery using pig artery models&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used porcine (pig) coronary arteries, which closely resemble human heart arteries, and found that ferulic acid significantly reduced artery contractions caused by chemical stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;

Even when calcium isn’t involved, it still prevents artery tightening by stopping a specific protein (myosin light chain) from being activated, which is essential for muscle contraction. Credit: Kento Yoshioka&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study revealed two key actions of ferulic acid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It blocks calcium from entering muscle cells through L-type calcium channels, which are normally responsible for causing the arteries to contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when calcium is not involved, it still prevents the arteries from tightening by inhibiting the activation of a specific protein called myosin light chain, which is essential for muscle contraction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, ferulic acid was sometimes even more effective than diltiazem, a widely used medication for relaxing blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Because ferulic acid is plant-based and considered safe, it may have potential as a health food ingredient or even as a foundation for future heart medications,” said lead researcher Dr. Kento Yoshioka.&lt;br&gt;
This research opens the door to new, natural ways of supporting heart health—possibly through diet or supplements in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Canada have found that anxiety could be a key warning sign that a cat is at risk of developing a disease known as &lt;a href="https://www.petmd.com/cat/conditions/urinary/feline-idiopathic-cystitis-fic-cats"&gt;feline idiopathic cystitis&lt;/a&gt; (FIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being idiopathic, the cause of FIC is currently a mystery. Yet the discovery of heightened skittishness in kitties with recurrent forms of the condition might be the evidence scientists need to understand the pathology and its triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of FIC tend to mimic those of a typical lower urinary tract infection. Affected cats may strain to urinate, pee in small amounts more frequently, or vocalize their discomfort while using the litter box. In more severe cases, their urine may even contain blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike bacterial infections, however, urine samples from cats with FIC are sterile. Vets will usually rule out infection and other causes before landing on FIC as a likely culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly half of all cats unfortunate enough to receive a diagnosis will experience the disease again at some point in their life. And given one in five cats with recurring FIC are eventually put to rest by their owners, a means of distinguishing the illness from other conditions might go a long way to saving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cats-can-have-a-profound-effect-on-your-physical-and-mental-health"&gt;our beloved cats&lt;/a&gt; from ongoing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164697" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164697" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox.jpg" alt="cat looking scared in a litter box" class="size-full wp-image-164697" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/CatScaredInRedLitterBox-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164697" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Heightened skittishness in kitties with recurrent forms of FIC might be the evidence scientists need to understand the pathology and its triggers. (Kitzzeh/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some cats end up being euthanized because of it," &lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/06/10/anxious-cats-prone-to-recurring-cystitis/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; zoological medical scientist Marion Desmarchelier from the University of Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The disease itself is not fatal, but the cost of repeated emergency treatments can be too much for some families."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/veterinary-science/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.900847/full"&gt;studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; the condition's roots may be found in the nexus between the body's hormonal and nervous systems. Specifically, in an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022534705652536"&gt;imbalance between&lt;/a&gt; stimulations and responses related to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline"&gt;neurotransmitter adrenaline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The going theory suggests an exaggerated dumping of adrenaline damages junctions in the bladder's wall, exposing sensory nerves that cause pain and trigger inflammation. If the poor moggy lacks an ability to tune down their adrenal response because of the damage, they just might expect episodes of discomfort to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the full picture is still unclear, the role of adrenaline points to a psychological component – perhaps not just as a red flag for FIC, but a cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164617" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164617" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642.jpg" alt="scared cat behind a door" class="wp-image-164617 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/scared_cat_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164617" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scaredy cats might be a sign of bladder damage. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEQIkC4nC4/"&gt;Serhii Semenovych/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team contacted owners of cats diagnosed with FIC during the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="164614" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and asked them to fill out a questionnaire on their cat's behavior, potential recurrences of the disease, and whether they complied with certain environmental recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 33 surveys that were returned, the scientists noticed a clear difference between cats who had experienced just one instance of FIC and those with recurrences – just over half of the one-offs were reported to be skittish around strangers, compared with nearly all of those with repeat episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A range of other behaviors could be ruled out as related, including aggression on behalf of the cats or whether they themselves were victims of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We initially thought that anxious, aggressive cats would be more prone to recurrent cystitis, but it's actually the fearful, withdrawn ones that seem to be at greater risk," &lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/06/10/anxious-cats-prone-to-recurring-cystitis/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Desmarchelier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest FIC be seen more as a consequence of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-vet-shares-5-simple-tips-to-keep-your-cat-happy-and-healthy"&gt;a cat's mental well-being&lt;/a&gt; rather than a bladder condition. Helping anxious cats feel calm and safe just might reduce their risk of inflammation in their urinary tract, they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612X18774437"&gt;Calming tactics include&lt;/a&gt; ensuring your cat has access to multiple safe hiding places they can use to escape other household members when they desire. Pheromone therapy can also help lower their stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research could provide crucial evidence that helps pinpoint how a cat's anxiety and comfort in their home affect functions as seemingly unrelated as their ability to urinate comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, pet owners are encouraged to pay close attention to their cat companions when company is around and help them &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-genetic-mystery-of-why-cats-purr-may-finally-be-solved"&gt;feel at ease&lt;/a&gt;. Their anxiety could be having a bigger effect on them than we ever realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2025.02.005"&gt;Journal of Veterinary Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, the latest data available, the FDA reported 1,264 cases of BIA-ALCL and 63 deaths in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For their study, published in the journal Blood Advances, researchers &lt;span&gt;followed 3,000 breast cancer survivors at MSKCC who had breast implants after a double mastectomy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Double mastectomies are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14460739/breanna-bortner-dog-sniffed-cancer-saved-life-minnesota.html"&gt;meant to stop breast cancer from spreading&lt;/a&gt; to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of those, 520 were tested for BRCA mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About eight percent of patients, 43, who were tested for BRCA mutations ended up being carriers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After following the women for 12 years on average, the researchers found those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations had a 16-fold increased risk of BIA-ALCL. They also found women with BIA-ALCL were 'significantly' more likely to have BRCA mutations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gione said: 'Our findings show that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are a significant risk factor for developing this type of lymphoma, confirming earlier suggestions of a possible role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s possible that implant-associated lymphoma is yet another cancer that can arise because of these genetic mutations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers said while BIA-ALCL is still rare, women with BRCA mutations should be cautious before receiving textured breast implants (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Breast implants with textured surfaces, which can feel like sandpaper, are thought to create space where bacteria can accumulate and form biofilms, or collections of micro-organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These harmful biofilms can trigger an inflammatory response, which damages DNA and causes cells to mutate into cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Silicone in some implants may also lead to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the risk of BIA-ALCL is so low, the FDA doesn't recommend having textured implants removed unless women experience symptoms, which include pain, lumps, swelling or unexpected changes in breast shape.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ghione said: 'The implants that are put in place now are theoretically safe; however, there are still a lot of women who are living with textured breast implants, so it’s important that women know what implants they have and talk with their doctor and remember to report this surgery as part of their medical history.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:53:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOZ0tURkxDN01rRVU0a2hPNGV4MnlxcVRfUHY0N1Fsbmd2eEZvZXJxOUwtYWpRMEVKUUx5TlJaT2pjSkwwam83TDc5d2ZPU1R3YlZrMkE4eDdCVFJ4bzdDVTlsNnZkVUloelpwSWJEZExnYnpuOTJJa0Zad0VtNkhGQThHVzlKQUtzVWo5RWtFWmlyMFMtcWpSWFdlN3TSAaIBQVVfeXFMTmI3dlk1VEJ1ZjZSR3ZSY0h3TjdnQldac2VyTUk3YkNpb0pyTmV3dWs3eUxWN3dkRURRZWxydWZkYTd3SGpYUVJSM3NJTjc0cVAwaklsY3lNanMyV2lFdFQ0UFg4OEctLUlmQldKaUx0VW53UjlwcWxuTHhmX2xaaURqdXlPMlhCSjBYYlB5bmwwRkdWWDNSbmhsWHJZQUtVTDd3</guid></item><item><title>水果和蔬菜提高睡眠质量-神经科学新闻 | Fruits and Veggies Boost Sleep Quality - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE1SQVlMSEVsU0VCeUEzNkF1cGxIaG1qMmw0M05Qb1JIYm16MlJKaF9ucFpTUkJ2SnJyNl84Y0ppQ2F0QUhTMERSdWV3dXBHMEU2WHRVSzhjV3hBLTAwZVFKZndWT2NobEs1TTNnNnRlSC1ZV0Z1VVFrRg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study finds that eating more fruits and vegetables during the day is linked to improved sleep quality that same night.

However, despite the far-reaching effects of sleep on public health and even economic productivity, doctors and scientists know far less about how diet can affect sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous observational studies, high fruit and vegetable intakes were associated with better self-reported overall sleep quality, but this new study was the first to draw a temporal connection between a given day’s dietary choices and objectively-measured sleep quality that same night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy young adults who participated in the study reported their food consumption each day with an app and wore a wrist monitor that allowed the researchers to objectively measure their sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers specifically looked at “sleep fragmentation,” an index that reflects how often someone awakens or shifts from deep to light sleep throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising findings support dietary guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that each day’s diet was correlated with meaningful differences in the subsequent night’s sleep. Participants who ate more fruits and vegetables during the day tended to have deeper, more uninterrupted sleep that same night, as did those who consumed more healthy carbohydrates like whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings and statistical modeling, the researchers estimate that people who eat the CDC-recommended five cups of fruits and veggies per day could experience a 16 percent improvement in sleep quality compared to people who consume no fruits or vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“16 percent is a highly significant difference,” Tasali said. “It’s remarkable that such a meaningful change could be observed within less than 24 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will help establish causation, broaden the findings across diverse populations, and examine the underlying mechanisms of digestion, neurology, and metabolism that could explain the positive impact of fruits and vegetables on sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But based on current data, the experts confidently advise that regularly eating a diet rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables is best for long-term sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are always asking me if there are things they can eat that will help them sleep better,” said co-senior author Marie-Pierre St-Onge, PhD, director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep &amp;amp; Circadian Research at Columbia. “Small changes can impact sleep. That is empowering — better rest is within your control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher daytime intake of fruits and vegetables predicts less disrupted nighttime sleep in younger adults” was published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep Health: The Journal of the National Sleep Foundation&lt;/em&gt; in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors include Hedda L.

However, a better understanding of this association is needed given that dietary modifications could represent a novel and natural approach to achieve better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine how daytime dietary intakes influence sleep quality on the following night using multiple days of self-reported diet monitoring and objective sleep measured under free-living conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were younger US adults with average habitual sleep duration between 7 and 9 hours per night. Diet was assessed using the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour Dietary Assessment Tool. Sleep was measured using wrist actigraphy. Sleep fragmentation index was used for objective assessment of sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-four participants (age: 28.3±6.6years, BMI: 24.1±3.9 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 82.3% males, 50.0% racial/ethnic minority) provided 201 paired diet-sleep data. Greater daytime intakes of fruits and vegetables (β-coefficient (SE)=−0.60 (0.29), &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.038) and carbohydrates (−0.02 (0.007), &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.022), but not added sugar (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.54), were associated with lower sleep fragmentation index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trends toward associations of higher intakes of red and processed meat (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.10) with more disrupted sleep, as well as higher fiber (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.08) and magnesium (&lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=.09) intakes with less disrupted sleep, were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher daytime intakes of fruits and vegetables and carbohydrates that align with a healthy diet were associated with less disrupted nighttime sleep. A 5-cup increase (from no intake) in fruits and vegetables, meeting dietary recommendations, was associated with 16% better sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that diets rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables may promote better sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:43:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1SQVlMSEVsU0VCeUEzNkF1cGxIaG1qMmw0M05Qb1JIYm16MlJKaF9ucFpTUkJ2SnJyNl84Y0ppQ2F0QUhTMERSdWV3dXBHMEU2WHRVSzhjV3hBLTAwZVFKZndWT2NobEs1TTNnNnRlSC1ZV0Z1VVFrRg</guid></item><item><title>一位医生分享了他每天服用的7种补充剂，以减少炎症、预防心脏病和支持新陈代谢- AOL.com | A doctor shares the 7 supplements he takes a day to reduce inflammation, prevent heart disease, and support metabolism - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFB1dGVuUFE5ZXNxZGZvY0tvMXNYV3NVRk5wODZZSWpna3llaWZWWlZzSFYtZXNLNGpvX3gySWFFYldrSWlFSXo2d2d4ejJfbnZsUmdzb0dUYmM2QWh3NnVtNzRvT1NtQWU5MGQ2Y2M1Um5CMGJaUlg4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff worked as a liver surgeon for Cleveland Clinic, where he became passionate about supplements to prevent diseases he operated on.&lt;span class="copyright"&gt;Courtesy of Gareth Morris-Stiff/Getty Images/Songboon Ramsak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements like herbs, vitamins, and minerals can backfire if you don't use them correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mixing too many supplements and medications can cause stress and damage to your liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A liver doctor explains his 7-step supplement routine, with benefits for healthy aging and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements can be a great way to get an edge in your fitness, reduce the risk of disease, and even boost longevity — but picking the right combination is key to avoiding side effects, said a liver doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a common misconception that supplements, especially natural ones like herbs, are safer than medications. They can actually cause &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-doctors-dangers-of-taking-multiple-supplements-less-is-more-2024-11?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:serious health problems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;serious health problems&lt;/a&gt; if taken incorrectly. Up to 20% of liver toxicity cases in the US are related to supplements, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's also a mistake to rule out the potential health benefits of supplements, including those from traditions like Chinese medicine or Ayurveda, according to Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff, a former surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and chief medical officer at &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://theliverclinic.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Liver Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;The Liver Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of them extremely useful, very beneficial to human health," Morris-Stiff told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the risks from supplements come from taking too much, or too many compounds at once, including medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a matter of getting the right compound for you as an individual for your needs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to combine supplements without damaging your liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important rule for your supplement routine is to choose the right supplements for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can work out the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to reduce inflammation, milk thistle can help. But it doesn't mix well with other herbs or drugs like antivirals or sleep medications. Combined, it can become too much for the liver to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said one patient he worked with had a cirrhotic liver and jaundice, with yellow skin and eyes, after taking medications with supplements and home-grown garden herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individually they were good, but everything coming together, it ended with toxicity. There's too much competition for the detoxification system in the liver," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check an online research database, such as from the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, for safety information and any known drug interactions before starting a supplement. And always consult your doctor if you're not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what Morris-Stiff takes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Curcumin or turmeric for inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said daily curcumin has been part of his routine for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/turmeric-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turmeric;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, and research has found it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. A &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11009219/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found curcumin may help slow aging and help protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His daily dose of turmeric comes from a supplement blend called De-Liver-Ance developed by The Liver Clinic, which also includes peppermint, star anise, red sage, and the nutrient choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Vitamin D is crucial for the immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said he takes a daily multivitamin which contains 5,000 units of vitamin D, well over the typical 600-800 units typically recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that vitamin D has a history of being used in large doses to help the body fight off &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/vitamin-d3-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:illness and infection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;illness and infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's more in line with what we need," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 40% of Americans are deficient in the nutrient. Talk to your doctor to get your own levels tested and see whether supplementing might help, and how much to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Selenium reduces risk of chronic disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mineral found in nuts, seafood, beans, and organ meats, selenium is a antioxidant that can help reduce the risk of heart disease and somes cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff takes 200 micrograms per day, about four times as much usually recommended by the FDA which he said "woefully inadequate" as the amount of the nutrient in our food has &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1611576114" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declined over time;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;declined over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Zinc supports healthy aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same multivitamin Morris-Stiff takes daily also includes 50 milligrams of zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/zinc-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Zinc&lt;/a&gt; is another trace mineral with an important role in protecting metabolism and healthy cell development over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Magnesium is key for brain and muscle health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out his daily mineral supplements, Morris-Stiff said he takes &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/magnesium-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:500 milligrams of magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;500 milligrams of magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, twice per day, to improve sleep and to help manage a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I use it for rest and sleep predominantly, it helps calm my heart," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/magnesium-for-sleep?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; has surged in popularity in recent years as a tool for more restful sleep, as it helps regular the nerves, muscles, and brain, potentially easing anxiety and restlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Fatty acids fight inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff routinely supplements essential fatty acids like &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/omega-3-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, which have been linked to healthy aging, lower information, and reduced accumulation of fat in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recently switched to taking a similar &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fatty-acid-butter-dairy-may-be-healthy-new-research-suggests-2022-3?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fatty acid called C15:0;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fatty acid called C15:0&lt;/a&gt;, which emerging evidence suggests may reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and liver problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a surgeon scientist, I like to look at the evidence," he said.

and the eighth-most populous  in the US, with a population of over 2.6 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infected woman also traveled to the city of Plano, and she visited two businesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On May 31 between the hours of 9am to noon the infected woman visited Lemma Coffee in the downtown area and the next day, on June 1, she went to the First Baptist church from 1pm to 5:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials said the woman has received care, and they are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to DCHHS, this is an ongoing investigation of an isolated case because the source of the woman's exposure to measles is not known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the new case comes as Texas is battling a measles outbreak that has infected nearly 800 people and killed two children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of America's biggest counties is on red alert after a resident was diagnosed with measles, potentially infecting others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At this time, 744 cases have been confirmed in the state since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety-six of the patients have been hospitalized and there &lt;span&gt;have been two fatalities in unvaccinated school-aged children who lived in the outbreak area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, in the US there have been 1,168 confirmed measles cases reported by 34 states and at least three deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is the world's most contagious disease - infecting nine out of 10 people exposed - but those who are fully vaccinated are protected in 97 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and a high fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If severe, it can lead to life-threatening pneumonia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children need two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine: the first at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one to three in 1,000 people with measles dies of the illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html" class=""&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html" class=""&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is below the 95 percent needed to prevent the disease from spreading and causing deaths.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Whether you’re into sports or simply hoping to stay active for the long haul, learning about a supplement called creatine can feel like a breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking plenty of water and making smart dietary choices might help, but many people still worry they’re missing something crucial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-creatine-the-basics"&gt;Understanding creatine – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a natural substance your body uses for energy. It helps your muscles, brain, and other parts of your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-is-far-more-important-than-weight-for-living-a-healthy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body work better&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body makes some creatine on its own, and you also get some from eating meat and fish. But not everyone gets enough – especially people who don’t eat much meat or fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t get enough creatine, it can affect your health. Kids and teens who don’t get enough may be shorter, weigh less, or have more body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults may have a higher chance of getting sick or having problems with memory and thinking. Some women might have more issues with pregnancy or their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-can-reshape-a-babys-brain-before-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reproductive health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older people with low creatine might have more trouble with heart health, thinking clearly, or staying strong. This new study digs much deeper into the health benefits of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-creatine-is-good-for-health"&gt;Why creatine is good for health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Kreider from &lt;a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; is studying creatine as a natural compound, where it is found in meat and fish, that plays a key role in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-tracking-apple-watch-is-helpful-but-not-always-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It converts into &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Phosphocreatine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phosphocreatine&lt;/a&gt;, which powers your cells when you’re pushing yourself in demanding workouts or dealing with daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not only about lifting heavier or running faster. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8228369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that being low in creatine can correlate with less lean mass, heightened body fat, and reduced athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have studied creatine for several decades, looking into its safety and effects on adults, children, and even older populations. One large &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported that plenty of individuals fail to get enough from diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-creatine-do-you-really-need"&gt;How much creatine do you really need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You only get about a gram of creatine per pound of red meat or fish, like salmon, so it’s expensive and takes a lot of calories to get a gram,” said Dr. Kreider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-bursts-of-intense-exercise-can-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bodies&lt;/a&gt; typically produce about one gram of creatine per day, which falls short of what most of us need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5545206/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; suggest starting with five grams of creatine four times daily for about a week, and then reducing to 5 to 10 grams a day. This approach boosts creatine without relying solely on large quantities of meat or fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your exact dose can depend on muscle mass, level of activity, and dietary habits. Whether someone is an athlete in heavy training or a retiree looking to stay active, practical guidance from a medical professional is often the best route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-creatine-safe-nbsp"&gt;Is creatine safe? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,” said Dr. Kreider. Though you might have heard stories about bloating or cramps, these claims are unsubstantiated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent comprehensive study, involved more than 600 trials, and saw no major uptick in side effects among creatine users compared to those taking placebos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claims that creatine harms the kidneys or leads to long-term problems have not been supported by real-world research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, as with anything else you put in your body, quality matters. Choosing products from reputable sources and verifying labels can help you steer clear of questionable ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clear-health-benefits-for-different-ages"&gt;Clear health benefits for different ages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people grow older, maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-ai-artificial-intelligence-changing-health-diet-fitness-exercise-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; mass and healthy cognition can get tricky. Researchers have observed that creatine, when taken consistently, may support muscle health and daily function in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescents might also stand to gain. When diets fall short in providing the recommended two to four grams of creatine a day, kids could experience slower growth and higher body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working out isn’t the only time you rely on strong muscles. Everyday tasks like standing up from a chair, carrying groceries, and climbing stairs depend on maintaining muscle strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those on plant-based diets, supplementing can make sense. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, you skip the top food sources of creatine (meat and fish), so a supplemental form can fill that gap more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-health-and-creatine-supplements"&gt;Human health and creatine supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrition &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/books/reprint/5131-creatine-supplementation-for-health-and-clinical-diseases"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; have probed links between creatine levels and mood, immunity, and even heart health. While the evidence is still growing, they see promise in using it alongside a balanced lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost factor also comes into play. Buying high-quality red meat or fish every day can strain your wallet, while creatine supplements can be a cost-friendly way to meet your target intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though you can measure out a few grams of powder daily, it’s smart to pair creatine with a nutrient-rich diet. Complex carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats all work in tandem with creatine to energize your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is also crucial. Water helps your system manage nutrients, including creatine, and keeps you from running on empty.

&lt;p&gt;When a female peregrine falcon paid a visit to the top of the Campanile on the UC Berkeley campus last week, the sighting raised hopes that another nest of fluffy chicks might follow, if not this year then in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beautiful girl, I hope she sticks around,” wrote a commenter under a webcam photo of the bird posted on Instagram by &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKigk5WoqaA/?igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="&gt;Cal Falcons&lt;/a&gt;, a group of scientists and volunteers who document the Campanile falcons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We had an unknown female visiting the tower this afternoon. Hopefully we’ll start to see more exploration of the Campanile soon!,” posted Cal Falcons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since Annie, the female peregrine who enchanted Berkeley by producing chicks at the Campanile for eight consecutive years starting in 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2025/02/24/uc-berkeley-falcons-missing-avian-flu-annie-archie"&gt;failed to return&lt;/a&gt; to the campus to breed this year, any falcon sightings have been greeted with enthusiasm. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Since the beginning of this year, we’ve probably seen about five birds (landing at the Campanile),” said ecologist Sean Peterson of Cal Falcons. “None of them have stayed very long; they’ve all been there for five minutes to half an hour.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peterson believes the raptors were probably all passing through and moving further north. He said birds will often explore existing or abandoned territories to see if they’re a good fit for future breeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mary Malec, another Cal Falcons expert, was also excited about last week’s raptor visitor. “All of us were really delighted to see it,” she said. “It looked very healthy.” Malec said the adult bird’s unique markings made clear it was neither Annie nor Archie, Annie’s most recent mate with whom she had&lt;a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2024/04/25/falcons-hatch-day-shown-live-on-bampfa-wednesday"&gt; four chicks&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-annie-and-archie-have-not-been-seen-for-months"&gt;Annie and Archie have not been seen for months&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The odds of Annie and Archie making a return to the campus are low. Wildlife photographer Bridget Ahern, who has chronicled the campus falcons for years, told UC Berkeley News in February she &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/02/24/uc-berkeley-falcons-annie-and-archie-are-missing-is-avian-flu-the-cause/"&gt;last saw Archie in December, when the pair were mating, and Annie on Jan. 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The celebrated peregrines haven’t been spotted since then, forcing the falcon experts to conclude they’re not alive. “Peregrines are very loyal to their nest sites. They don’t just go somewhere else. The fact that they are not here, we can pretty much conclude that they are dead,” Malec said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists are attributing their absence to the virulent H5 Bird Flu, or avian flu that is killing birds nationwide. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;Data &lt;/a&gt;from the Center for Disease Control (C.D.C.) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;shows California&lt;/a&gt; has among the highest number of flu cases in the country.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Peterson said 50% of the Bay Area’s historic territories for falcons have been unoccupied for the last two years. Floaters, the replacement falcons who swoop in to take over a territory or mate, and might provide hope for a new family at the Campanile, are also dropping in number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;San Jose City Hall is one of the lucky sites to have an active nest this year. “Their babies just fledged, (and) they flew for the first time,” Peterson said. A recent San Jose City Hall Falcons Facebook post showed four peregrine chicks &lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid02c45yAdFCQPGdWvrJYp6iucM7iBWJvMfM5Yennp7fKr6y3sJjdJkTeCNJ51r6sDb5l&amp;amp;id=100064867295116&amp;amp;mibextid=wwXIfr"&gt;hanging around the louvers&lt;/a&gt; of the City Hall building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avian-flu-pretty-bad-among-falcons"&gt;Avian flu “pretty bad” among falcons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avian flu is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;widespread among wild birds&lt;/a&gt;, according to the C.D.C. Malec said the infection rate is “pretty bad now” among falcons, and that raptor researchers need a year to gauge the extent of the long-term damage to the species. “This coming winter will tell raptor biologists whether peregrine falcons are going to survive it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Audubon Magazine said the current decline in peregrine falcon numbers had &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/magazine/why-are-peregrine-falcon-numbers-falling-united-states-again"&gt;“not seen since the DDT era”&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960s and ‘70s, when the raptors were near extinction due to widespread use of the pesticide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie, who was estimated to be 10 last year, was an exceptional breeder. She produced a batch of eggs every year between 2016 and 2024, and birthed a total of 22 chicks. Just three of the 22 offspring have been sighted in the Bay Area since they fledged, said Peterson. They were on Alcatraz island, in San Jose, and in Vallejo; but they’ve not been seen recently and Peterson has attributed their absence to avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peregrines are the fastest birds in the world. When they dive down to capture prey below them, they can reach speeds of up to 240 miles an hour. Some peregrines migrate, but a long trip is not why Annie and Archie have disappeared. “Birds that are breeding up in Canada leave their nest in August and fly down to Mexico and stay until April or May before returning,” Peterson said. “Bay Area falcons are different; they stay here, year round.” He said it was “pretty weird” in 2022 when Annie vanished for more than a week.&lt;/p&gt;

Left to right — Rosa, Luna and Zephyr. Credit: Cal Falcons &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Campanile’s height — 307 feet, which makes it the tallest structure in Berkeley — makes it attractive to falcons which like to be really high, according to Malec. The many smaller birds who are drawn to the area’s numerous trees, and on which the peregrines prey, also gives the campus a competitive edge. “There are pigeons and sunbirds around, and shorebirds as we’re are not far from the Bay,” Malec said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the bell tower is ready and waiting to host another peregrine family. The three webcams that have monitored the bell tower’s falcons since 2019 continue to roll, and the gravel nest where eggs are hatched is being maintained. The area is kept private too. “The university is very good about keeping the doors (to the site) locked, putting up signs warning people (visitors) not to go up,” Malec said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malec believes the continuing impact of avian flu means it might take a couple of years before the Campanile welcomes another mating raptor couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peterson holds on to a glimmer of hope that we’ll see visitors who decide to stay before then. “There could be one next week,” he said, “Who knows? We could have a bird any time.” Realistically, however, he thinks it’s likely we’ll see a falcon establishing a territory at the Campanile over the fall-to-winter timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Supplements can be a great way to get an edge in your fitness, reduce the risk of disease, and even boost longevity — but picking the right combination is key to avoiding side effects, said a liver doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a common misconception that supplements, especially natural ones like herbs, are safer than medications. They can actually cause &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-doctors-dangers-of-taking-multiple-supplements-less-is-more-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;serious health problems&lt;/a&gt; if taken incorrectly. Up to 20% of liver toxicity cases in the US are related to supplements, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's also a mistake to rule out the potential health benefits of supplements, including those from traditions like Chinese medicine or Ayurveda, according to Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff, a former surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and chief medical officer at &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://theliverclinic.com/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;The Liver Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of them extremely useful, very beneficial to human health," Morris-Stiff told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the risks from supplements come from taking too much, or too many compounds at once, including medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a matter of getting the right compound for you as an individual for your needs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1cf7fede-ca92-4715-8c6c-ed4a6ab85a1c" data-toc-id="1cf7fede-ca92-4715-8c6c-ed4a6ab85a1c"&gt;How to combine supplements without damaging your liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important rule for your supplement routine is to choose the right supplements for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can work out the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to reduce inflammation, milk thistle can help. But it doesn't mix well with other herbs or drugs like antivirals or sleep medications. Combined, it can become too much for the liver to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said one patient he worked with had a cirrhotic liver and jaundice, with yellow skin and eyes, after taking medications with supplements and home-grown garden herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individually they were good, but everything coming together, it ended with toxicity. There's too much competition for the detoxification system in the liver," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check an online research database, such as from the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, for safety information and any known drug interactions before starting a supplement. And always consult your doctor if you're not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what Morris-Stiff takes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c" data-toc-id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Curcumin or turmeric for inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c"&gt;Morris-Stiff said daily curcumin has been part of his routine for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c"&gt;Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/turmeric-benefits" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, and research has found it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11009219/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found curcumin may help slow aging and help protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c"&gt;His daily dose of turmeric comes from a supplement blend called De-Liver-Ance developed by The Liver Clinic, which also includes peppermint, star anise, red sage, and the nutrient choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2e3f809a-40a9-414a-9b3b-6497cfde3c53" data-toc-id="2e3f809a-40a9-414a-9b3b-6497cfde3c53"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Vitamin D is crucial for the immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c"&gt;Morris-Stiff said he takes a daily multivitamin which contains 5,000 units of vitamin D, well over the typical 600-800 units typically recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c"&gt;He said that vitamin D has a history of being used in large doses to help the body fight off &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/vitamin-d3-benefits" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;illness and infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c"&gt;"I think that's more in line with what we need," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="52f06a56-3f6c-4bc8-bc02-160bd9befc5c"&gt;As many as 40% of Americans are deficient in the nutrient. Talk to your doctor to get your own levels tested and see whether supplementing might help, and how much to take.&lt;/p&gt;

Some even think it can stave off jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Mel Gibson and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/joe-rogan"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; even discussed the stuff on &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, claiming ‘this stuff works’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Rogan said at one point that he takes the stuff daily, thanking RFK Jr as he reckons the stuff has ‘profound effects on your mitochondria’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Meanwhile, US podcaster Gabby Reece previously said she'd been trying methylene blue ‘in different scenarios’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A number of celebrities and influencers have praised the stuff (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;With many of the claims of benefits unsupported, many experts warn against using methylene blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Neuroscientist Anne-Sophie Fluri &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14795783/doctors-verdict-longevity-elixir-Joe-Rogan-RFK-Jr-swear-reverses-aging.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Daily Mail: “Without solid evidence in humans, these claims are at best speculative and at worst potentially dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Experts have reportedly found that recreational use of the substance can lead to serious complications, including seizures or destruction of red blood cells in vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The brain is not a machine you can casually 'optimise' like a smartphone,” Fluri added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Another danger of methylene blue is serotonin syndrome which is rare but potentially serious. This occurs when the levels of serotonin in your brain become too high, usually happening if you take antidepressants in combination with another medicine or substance. Symptoms include confusion, agitation, muscle twitching, sweating, shivering and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And, if anything, too much of the stuff can turn your wee blue and that’s surely never a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Self-experimentation with methylene blue is heavily warned against and you should consult a doctor if you’re considering using it for any health purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 13:46:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQM2pQRDQtalBfTE5taFAxNW9wczQ0UmktbXNhVzg0RXo5bUNvaVg2czdlMG04YW9NQ0Fnc1NVOG5RdnR0NEZTekRqdXZRNXNpcUtzc2FuR2xOZVMzMjdiSW1wX181Z0luODJLU09LUElpbG1WUnNvS1lTUHNfUmFWRmEyVkxXMy1iRG5neThadkdGUktVOWR0VmZoTXdqbWNoRmZsQw</guid></item><item><title>运动重新连接患有阿尔茨海默氏症的脑细胞-神经科学新闻 | Exercise Rewires Alzheimer’s-Affected Brain Cells - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1nQy1JbC1jLWxKVFVnUXk0WmtkVnloS0FZdDl5RkpGSkZrRHlPclprNXlDUlNkbHp5NnhTQTUyS2ZGbzM1S1lVVzQxRnkxTXVHb0x1b0RhWlc3NEN1RkN3Zlg1NkZXeUZLQ01QZjhYNzV4Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Using cutting-edge RNA sequencing, researchers mapped how exercise affects specific brain cell types in a model of Alzheimer’s disease. They found that physical activity alters gene activity in microglia and a newly identified type of astrocyte linked to blood vessels, which may protect memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metabolic gene &lt;em&gt;Atpif1&lt;/em&gt; emerged as a key player in promoting the birth of new neurons.

			&lt;p&gt;Bad news for extreme exercise junkies out there: too much vigorous exercise could temporarily make your immune system less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least, that's what the evidence shows. An analysis from 2023 of over 4,700&lt;/span&gt; post-exercise fluid molecules from firefighters suggests workers who require intense fitness training, such as emergency workers and athletes, may put themselves at risk of some illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who are very fit might be more prone to viral respiratory infection immediately after vigorous exercise," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1007461"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) biomedical scientist Ernesto Nakayasu. "Having less inflammatory activity to fight off an infection could be one cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the following video for a summary of the study's findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32139352/"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that moderate physical activity among healthy individuals &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/4/8/1801/454550/Impact-of-exercise-on-the-immune-system-and"&gt;can favor the immune system&lt;/a&gt; in the long run, what happens to the immune system directly following vigorous exercise is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little reliable evidence that supports the claim that intense exercise heightens the risk of opportunistic infections, although a few &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16558471"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2266764/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e318243253d"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; self-reported upper tract respiratory infections in athletes, compared to control groups, after strenuous activities. Whether these are correlations or causations is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Nakayasu and colleagues tested the blood plasma, urine, and saliva, from 11 firefighters before and after 45 minutes of intense exercise hauling up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of gear over hilly terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143822" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143822" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642.jpg" alt="People carrying gear up a hill" class="size-full wp-image-143822" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143822" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People who are very fit might be more prone to viral respiratory infection immediately after vigorous exercise.

"Perhaps we can reduce the risk of strenuous exercise for first responders, athletes, and members of the military."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no question exercise does wonders for our health, from boosting moods to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-might-delay-the-spread-of-cancer-by-fuelling-the-immune-system"&gt;strengthening our immune systems&lt;/a&gt;. But as in previous studies, the new research detected possible signs of immune suppression within the worked-out firefighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst the expected physical changes helping our bodies maintain the increase in fluids, energy, and oxygen that exercise demands, there was a decrease in molecules involved in inflammation. This was accompanied by increased &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiorphin"&gt;opiorphin&lt;/a&gt;, a dilator of peripheral blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these changes ultimately mean for the short-term function of the immune system is unclear, but the researchers have a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Opiorphin] may increase blood flow to muscles during the exercise regimen to improve the delivery of oxygen and nutrients," the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;writes in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We postulate that the decrease in inflammatory molecules we observed in the saliva after exercise might represent an adaptive mechanism to improve gas exchange in response to higher cellular oxygen demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143821" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642.jpg" alt="A man using battle ropes" class="size-full wp-image-143821" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143821" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There's no question exercise does wonders for our health. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADt-FxXAaE/"&gt;Ugur Karakoc/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was change in the participants' oral microbiome too. The scientists suspect this was due to the increase in antimicrobial peptides found in the firefighter's mouths after their intense activity, possibly to compensate for the immune suppression, although this conclusion is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, this increase in antimicrobial peptides had no effect on inhibiting &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; growth," Nakayasu and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;elaborate&lt;/a&gt;, "suggesting a limited capacity of antimicrobial peptides within the oral cavity to protect against host infections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, other scientists argue some of the changes observed may not be indications of immune suppression but of a "&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;heightened state of immune surveillance and immune regulation&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a within-subject comparison reduced the impact of their small sample size, firefighters experience unique exposures to pollutants during fires which may also change their immune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, this study only considered healthy and active men, the researchers cautioned, so further research amongst a broader community is needed to confirm their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, taken with previous studies, "there is evidence supporting a relationship between physical demands and a higher incidence of respiratory infections," Nakayasu and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Military Medical Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2023&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For far too long, the health, happiness, and well-being of our Nation’s men have been neglected, contributing to a troubling reality: men in the United States have a life expectancy five years shorter than women. They visit healthcare providers less frequently and often delay critical care. Men tend to have their first heart attack an average of 10 years earlier than women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This neglect has been compounded by a vicious campaign against masculinity. This war on manhood has left many American men in a state of loneliness, confusion, and emptiness, with devastating consequences: men in the United States are four times more likely to commit suicide and more than twice as likely to overdose than women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This National Men’s Health Week, I make a solemn pledge to honor the men in America: we will always have your back—and we will never waver in our promise to embolden you to lead long, healthy, and safe lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last month, I proudly signed an Executive Order to deliver most-favored-nation pricing to American patients, improve access to quality medical care, and lower the price of medications.  Together, with my Make America Healthy Again Commission, we are empowering men to prioritize their health and prolong their lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under my leadership, we will relentlessly pursue a healthier future for the men of our nation. We will always lift you up rather than tear you down, and we will champion the voices, values, and wellness of hardworking American men across our country.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

By continuously monitoring nasal airflow over 24 hours using a lightweight wearable, scientists discovered that these patterns also reflect physical and mental health traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing styles correlated with factors like BMI, anxiety levels, sleep cycles, and even behavioral tendencies. The findings open the door to using breath monitoring not just for identification, but also as a tool to assess and potentially improve emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Identifier:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals can be identified with 96.8% accuracy based solely on their nasal breathing patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathing styles reflect traits like BMI, sleep patterns, anxiety, and depression levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Modifying breathing patterns might improve mental health, suggesting future treatment applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Cell Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your breath is one of a kind. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published June 12 in the Cell Press journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that scientists can identify individuals based solely on their breathing patterns with 96.8% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These nasal respiratory “fingerprints” also offer insights into physical and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research stemmed from the lab’s interest in olfaction, or the sense of smell. In mammals, the brain processes odor information during inhalation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This link between the brain and breathing led researchers to wonder: since every brain is unique, wouldn’t each person’s breathing pattern reflect that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the idea, the team developed a lightweight wearable device that tracks nasal airflow continuously for 24 hours using soft tubes placed under the nostrils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most breathing tests last just one to 20 minutes, focusing on evaluating lung function or diagnosing disease. But those brief snapshots aren’t enough to capture subtle patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You would think that breathing has been measured and analyzed in every way,” says author Noam Sobel of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet we stumbled upon a completely new way to look at respiration. We consider this as a brain readout.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sobel’s team fitted 100 healthy young adults with the device and asked them to go about their daily lives. Using the collected data, the team identified individuals using only their breathing patterns with high accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This high-level accuracy remained consistent across multiple retests conducted over a two-year period, rivaling the precision of some voice recognition technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought it would be really hard to identify someone because everyone is doing different things, like running, studying, or resting,” says author Timna Soroka of the Weizmann Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it turns out their breathing patterns were remarkably distinct.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the study found that these respiratory fingerprints correlated with a person’s body mass index, sleep-wake cycle, levels of depression and anxiety, and even behavioral traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, participants who scored relatively higher on anxiety questionnaires had shorter inhales and more variability in the pauses between breaths during sleep. Soroka noted that none of the participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for mental or behavioral conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that long-term nasal airflow monitoring may serve as a window into physical and emotional well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We intuitively assume that how depressed or anxious you are changes the way you breathe,” says Sobel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it might be the other way around. Perhaps the way you breathe makes you anxious or depressed. If that’s true, we might be able to change the way you breathe to change those conditions.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current device still faces real-world challenges. A tube that runs under the nose is often associated with illness and may deter adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device also doesn’t account for mouth breathing and can slip out of place when sleeping. The team aims to design a more discreet and comfortable version for everyday use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soroka and Sobel are already investigating whether people can mimic healthy breathing patterns to improve their mental and emotional states. “We definitely want to go beyond diagnostics to treatment, and we are cautiously optimistic,” says Sobel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this breathing and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#08787a6d7b7b486b6d6464266b6765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Queen Muse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://cell.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cell Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Queen Muse – Cell Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.05.008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Humans have nasal respiratory fingerprints&lt;/a&gt;” by Noam Sobel et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans have nasal respiratory fingerprints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term respiratory patterns are generated by remarkably complex brain networks. Because brains are unique, we hypothesized that their dependent respiratory patterns may be similarly unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, we developed a wearable device that precisely measures and logs nasal airflow in each nostril separately for up to 24-h periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that we could identify members of a 97-participant cohort at a remarkable 96.8% accuracy from nasal airflow patterns alone. In other words, humans have individual nasal airflow fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in test-retest experiments, we found that these individual fingerprints remain stable over extended periods of time, such that individual identification by nasal airflow fingerprints was on par with or better than voice recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we find that the high sensitivity of these fingerprints provides significant indications on both physiological states, such as levels of arousal and body-mass index, and cognitive traits, such as levels of anxiety, levels of depression, and behavioral tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude that long-term patterns of nasal airflow reflect the brain drivers of respiration, are individually unique, and have significant implications for health, emotion, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 12:38:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFAyY19pSk1ZeUVkV2NUSFJEampTZWVjeTRiS2pHR2RLaU9PbGROVGt1aGVfQWF6OTZ0SVRxTFZadWc3NlhLU28zajVGejVXVXY3TEd1ajF5ZmkzbC1abGd0T0p5cjQxUXZ3X3lRY3M2bEU2cllheXJJ</guid></item><item><title>当你经常吃西瓜时，你的身体会发生什么-非常健康 | What Happens to Your Body When You Eat Watermelon Regularly - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE52bU8xUmpnT1E1eFRiMmNUWDh5TDh1V01TdWtFWnpBaDE1Z0puTElqV1dIWDF6b2MyUktKWmtlQVhhYUZ3Q05XSWxLeHJIeDBRRm5kVGFEcTdhWjVZYmhLQVcySFlJR1E2WXZyNHowTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a reason you always crave watermelon when it’s hot outside.

			&lt;p&gt;Getting from A to B on a bicycle more often could reduce risk of dementia, possibly by protecting a part of the brain tied to memory functions, new research finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study carried out by researchers from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China and the University of Sydney backs up the idea that frequent amounts of moderate exercise and keeping the brain busy can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-find-common-link-between-distinct-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;guard against neurodegeneration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The findings of this cohort study suggest an association between active travel mode and incident dementia and brain structure," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14316"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following UK public health records of nearly half-a-million people aged on average around 56, the researchers looked for a relationship between common forms of transport most and whether individuals developed any &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modes of transport were split into four groups: non-active (cars and public transport), walking, walking and non-active combined, and finally a group of people who primarily cycled to get around, or used cycling alongside other options. Commutes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-commute-may-be-bad-for-you-heres-why"&gt;to and from work&lt;/a&gt; were excluded from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with non-active travelers, the cyclists had a 19 percent lower risk of all-cause dementia, a 22 percent lower risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="164593" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, a 40 percent lower risk of young-onset dementia (before the age of 65), and a 17 percent lower risk of late-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164595" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164595" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DementiaRisk.jpg" alt="graph with travel mode on the x axis, listing nonactive, walking, mixed-walking and cycling and mixed walking. on the y axis is incident dementia Hazard ratio. nonactive has a HR of 1.0, walking has a HR of more than 1, mixed walking slightly less than 1, cycling and mixed walking is less than 0.9" class="size-full wp-image-164595" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DementiaRisk.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DementiaRisk-546x415.jpg 546w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/DementiaRisk-600x456.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164595" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;All-cause dementia risk for various travel modes. (Hou et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that promoting active travel strategies, particularly cycling, may be associated with lower dementia risk among middle-aged and older adults, which carries substantial public health benefits by encouraging accessible, sustainable practices for cognitive health preservation," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14316"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a complex condition, and a whole host of factors are thought to be involved. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2022.112010"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have found a link between spatial navigational abilities and brain volume, for example, which fits in with what the researchers found here: that cyclists ended up with higher hippocampal volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164598" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BrainVolume.jpg" alt="6 different angles of the brain showing color-coded structures." class="size-full wp-image-164598" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BrainVolume.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BrainVolume-636x415.jpg 636w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BrainVolume-600x392.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164598" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The neuroimaging analyses provided evidence for positive associations between cycling and mixed-cycling mode and 10 regional gray matter volumes. (Hou et al., &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be the level of physical activity cycling demands that is largely responsible lowering the dementia risk, or having to negotiate routes and directions, or the need to stay alert, or perhaps being more exposed to fresh air. These are all mentioned by the researchers, as is genetic risk – cycling was less beneficial for those with the APOE4 gene variant &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-gene-doesnt-guarantee-dementia-heres-what-you-can-do-to-reduce-risk"&gt;linked to Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially influential variables like age and education were factored in, but the study doesn't show direct cause and effect – there are plenty of variables that weren't monitored. What it does show is a strong link, which makes sense in the context of other research (associating &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-much-weekly-exercise-can-slash-your-dementia-risk-by-41-percent"&gt;exercise with dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we do know is dementia is a growing issue worldwide, as populations get older. Methods for reducing dementia risk are desperately needed, and cycling could be an easy, affordable option for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dementia has emerged as a leading contributor to dependence and disability among older adults, with the global number of cases projected to rise from 55 million in 2019 to 139 million by 2050," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14316"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.14316"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Brooks Bell and Sarah Beran connected online in July 2023 over something unfortunate they had in common: they were both treated for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; in their 30s after doctors misdiagnosed them. Now, they're working together to prevent others from having the same experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Beran was told in 2020 at age 34 that she had colon cancer, she chalked her fatigue up to being a working mom with two young kids. And she presumed the blood that had started appearing in her stools was caused by hemorrhoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was just a crazy time with the kids. They were so young. I was so tired all the time anyway, and I was just so busy," Beran, a stylist in LA, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;common colon cancer symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in people under 50 are abdominal pain, changes to bowel movements such as going more or less frequently, constipation, bloating, and diarrhea, according to a 2024 study published in JAMA Network Open. But other symptoms include blood in feces, unexplained weight loss, anemia, and vomiting for no obvious reason.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many of these symptoms overlap with common digestive problems such as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which means doctors tread a tightrope when it comes to diagnosing younger, generally healthy patients. In a 2017 survey of 1,535 colon cancer survivors under 50 conducted by the Colorectal Cancer Alliance, 82% said they were initially misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2020 survey by the charity Bowel Cancer UK of 1,073 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed under 50, and 222 people who responded on a patient's behalf, found 42% were told by doctors they were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;too young to develop the condition&lt;/a&gt;. Half of the participants didn't know they could get the disease at their age, and two thirds were initially diagnosed with conditions such as IBS,  hemorrhoids, or anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a challenge to make sure a symptom is attributed to the correct condition without scaring people while also not overlooking the early signs of colorectal cancer, Joshua Demb, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego, who studies early-onset colon cancer, previously told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year into having IBS-like symptoms and needing to use the bathroom a lot more than usual, Beran's doctors sent her to a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/prevent-colon-cancer-gi-doctor-research-gut-microbiome-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastroenterologist&lt;/a&gt; who said she might have a parasite, but said it was likely nothing to worry about given her age, active lifestyle, and healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An at-home stool test for colon cancer detected no abnormalities. What are known as fecal immunochemical tests, or FIT, are about 80% accurate, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/cancer-center/colorectal-cancer-screening" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}'&gt;University of Colorado Cancer Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the bleeding got worse, Beran pushed for a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. She said that doctors found a mass on her rectum and "over 100" polyps — small growths that are often harmless but can turn into cancer — on her colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was quite shocking to hear the word 'cancer,'" she said. "Because I was so healthy, it just wasn't something that I thought would happen to me." Growing up, Beran played sports and, before her diagnosis, she exercised almost every day. &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-gi-doctor-prevent-colon-cancer-eating-healthy-gut-microbiome-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;She ate plenty of fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two years, Beran was treated with 12 rounds of chemotherapy, and surgery to remove the cancerous tissues. She was given a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bowel-cancer-set-london-marathon-record-stoma-adele-roberts-2023-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;temporary ileostomy&lt;/a&gt; connecting her small intestine to her abdomen to collect feces while her colon healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 2022, doctors told her the cancer had spread to her lungs, which was treated with more surgery, as well as radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has been "cancer-free" for almost three years, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel so silly looking back on it, but who's not tired, you know what I mean?" Beran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dce27ddb-b121-45b6-b923-0b5be3124e57" data-toc-id="dce27ddb-b121-45b6-b923-0b5be3124e57"&gt;Bell's doctor said the blood in her poop was likely caused by hemorrhoids&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The former CEO's doctor told her over the phone that she likely had hemorrhoids. When &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/blood-when-i-wipe" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;the bleeding didn't stop&lt;/a&gt; after a few weeks, Bell's doctor examined her in person and couldn't find hemorrhoids, but said they were probably higher up in her rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensing something wasn't right, Bell called a GI doctor without a referral, meaning it wasn't covered by her insurance. A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; revealed that she had stage 3 colon cancer, and was followed by three months of chemotherapy and surgery to remove 10 inches of her colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Bell hit the five-year cancer-free mark, where the likelihood that a cancer patient will have a recurrence drops. The cancer hasn't returned, but the worry never went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The treatment sucks, but the anxiety is so intense and is so persistent," she said, "you can't get away from it. It is barely tolerable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell is glad she trusted her instinct, despite being told several times the blood in her stool was nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were clues all along. You just needed to have someone who is willing to actually ask about your stool and really think about it, not shy away," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bfdb25a0-20a7-42b5-bd76-b6c3561f6016" data-toc-id="bfdb25a0-20a7-42b5-bd76-b6c3561f6016"&gt;More younger people are getting colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, thanks to screening and lifestyle changes, fewer people are developing colon cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. It estimates that in 2025, 107,320 new cases of colon cancer will be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bell and Beran are among a growing number of younger people to develop the disease. One in five colon cancer cases in 2019 were in people under 54, up from one in 10 in 1995, according to ACS data published in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause is unclear, but scientists have pointed to changes in the gut microbiome, antibiotic use, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt; as possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ca4ab9c8-1878-414b-80fd-5276bc2de18a" data-toc-id="ca4ab9c8-1878-414b-80fd-5276bc2de18a"&gt;Giving colonoscopies a trendy rebrand&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beran reached out to Bell online after she saw her Lead From Behind campaign, which featured Ryan Reynolds and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rob-mcelhenney-always-sunny-philadelphia-wrexham-wife-learning-disability-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Rob McElhenney&lt;/a&gt; getting colonoscopies on camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, they met on Zoom and decided to combine their respective skill sets to create &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.worldclassclothing.com/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Worldclass&lt;/a&gt;, a clothing line intended to reframe colonoscopies as cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They sell tote bags with the irreverent slogan "colonoscopy enthusiast" printed on, and streetwear-style tracksuits stitched with the the word "ass."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, people are advised to get their first colon cancer screening at 45, partly because age is a risk factor for developing polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if someone younger has more than one symptom of colon cancer, they should consider &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;getting a colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. James Cleary, a gastrointestinal oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, previously told BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a colonoscopy, patients are either sedated or under general anesthetic while a thin tube with a camera on the end is put in the rectum and colon to check for polyps. They must fast and take a laxative in the days before the procedure. If polyps are found, they can often be removed then and there, meaning the procedure can help prevent colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're actually more like a fast, cleanse, then a nap. It's actually almost like a spa appointment," Bell said of a colonoscopy. "We could be reframing it in positive ways, where it's just a self-care wellness kind of experience."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: "People do not know that it's this empowering, hopeful thing that can actually protect you from this major threat."&lt;/p&gt;

On kids' menus at restaurants, foods like chicken fingers and hot dogs abound, but rarely are there items like spinach, carrots or whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c21a01" class="body-graf"&gt;If you've given up on trying to get your child to eat vegetables on their own, no one would blame you. That's why so many parents opt to blend extra veggies into pasta sauces and other dishes where they may be less noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-240ca7" class="body-graf"&gt;Luckily, there's one highly nutritious superfood that many parents overlook and is enjoyable for many kids' palates, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/harvard-pediatrician-the-overlooked-superfood-more-parents-need-to-feed-kids.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kelly Fradin recently told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention it's versatile — it comes in many varieties and can be served as a side, blended into sauces and dressings, or even eaten as a meat replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-24b9ba" class="body-heading"&gt;Pediatrician Tip of the Day: Add More Beans to Your Kid's Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd34ec" class="body-graf"&gt;"Many parents already know the importance of feeding kids vegetables and limiting added sugar," Fradin explained. "We often discuss 'eating the rainbow,' emphasizing the need for a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables. Parents frequently prioritize dark leafy greens, antioxidant-rich blueberries and healthy-fat-packed avocados."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6011bd" class="body-graf"&gt;"However, there’s one nutritional powerhouse that often gets overlooked: beans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ef3d29" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b14ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;Beans are one of the top sources of plant-based protein. Plus, many beans are &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/complete-protein-foods-rcna199150" target="_blank"&gt;complete proteins&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids, Fradin noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ebbc3c" class="body-graf"&gt;They're also high in fiber, which can improve gut health and reduce blood sugar spikes, keeping energy levels stable. Beans pack in some important micronutrients, too, such as folate, magnesium and B vitamins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf565d" class="body-graf"&gt;Last, beans are affordable and have a long shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-70b35c" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3f3f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Fradin said that, in her experience, many kids genuinely enjoy the taste and texture of beans. Here are some of her ideas to introduce your kids to this surprising superfood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-fd396d" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steam edamame and serve them as a snack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put beans in a quesadilla with cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix black beans into brownies to add some nutritional value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add beans to chili, stew and soup recipes your kids already know and love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For more adventurous eaters, try lentil soup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-795a39" class="body-graf"&gt;"There’s a bean recipe out there for everyone," Fradin added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-242910" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2bpz7001m3b6htbsf1qft@published"&gt;I’m a straight woman in my early 30s, and I’ve always struggled to orgasm, but I do have them very occasionally through direct clit stimulation. Recently I was at the doctor and for medical reasons, and she flushed my ears with water. I was startled by how deeply good it felt to have touch inside my ears, and I unexpectedly orgasmed. She thought I was in pain, and I went along with that explanation because I was so embarrassed. I never want to orgasm at the doctor again, obviously. Any tips on how to separate this out? I want to keep things clinical if I have to get it done medically again, but I’d love to have a safe and direct route to orgasm at home. I feel so torn realizing that actually I can come easily, but that the route there is … weird and potentially unsafe. Is something wrong with my body? That is not an erogenous zone!&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, ear eroticism is common enough that there are loads of articles about it. The vagus nerve, which passes through the ear, has been known to be associated with orgasm, particularly vaginal orgasm, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/3100379.pdf?origin=ppub"&gt;since at least the ’90s&lt;/a&gt;. Studies largely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899304011461"&gt;focus on women with spinal cord injuries&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s a good data point. You are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2bpz8001q3b6hh9e8cfic@published"&gt;That said, your ears are delicate, and while people do live whole lives with hearing loss, you’ll want to avoid damage to that area. That means no blowing canned air into your ears, and no digging around with Q-tips.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2bpz8001r3b6h8r4no7dj@published"&gt;If it were me, I’d schedule another appointment with the doctor and explain what happened. They’ve probably heard of cases of pleasure during ear flushing, if not seen it themselves in clinical practice. They can give you medical level information about how to safely stimulate your ears, or at least reduce the risk of harm. If that’s too vulnerable for you, you might inquire about how to flush your ears at home safely. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tp002e3b6huerr8lnu@published"&gt;Before the pandemic started, I finally came to terms with my near exclusive attraction to other women after two years of hooking up with men. I’m happy and confident with this transition, but I’ve encountered a new struggle in my sex life: I’m an average-height, 240-pound woman who wants to wrestle and be physically dominated in bed. Due to my size and people-pleasing nature, I usually get stuck in a more dominant position with my partners. I’m happy to please others, but I don’t get much personal satisfaction when I’m not restrained. This feels shitty to say when my date, while otherwise attractive, doesn’t have the physical means to hold me down. How can I communicate this desire with potential partners? Can I only date women bigger or stronger than me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002h3b6hsga7zbyw@published"&gt;The part of your message where you say you don’t get much direct satisfaction when you aren’t restrained feels pretty crucial. It’s OK to have specific sexual desires and to seek out partners who can and want to meet those desires. Your enjoyment and fulfillment are as important as your partners’ are. Meanwhile, it sounds like you do get something out of fulfilling your partners’ sexual desires, even when that requires taking the active or dominant role, and if that’s the case you should continue to do so to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002i3b6h36ykp68l@published"&gt;Taking turns, or switching (as your sign-off suggests) is a great instinct. You can satisfy your partner in the way that feels best for them, and then be satisfied in the way that feels best for you. The roles you play during sex are just that—roles. They can be as temporary as you want them to be, and you can switch them as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="174" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002j3b6h3tzluiwh@published"&gt;Have you considered restraint with objects? Rope, cuffs, and tape are all popular options. The benefit of this kind of bondage is that it enables one person to restrain another regardless of how large or strong they are and for longer than human endurance lasts. If the restraints are thoroughly applied, you can pull and thrash against them in a way that you might be hesitant to with a person out of fear of hurting them. All of these methods require that your top be cautious about how tightly they’re restraining you and that you check in with your body yourself—specifically any restrained part—to make sure your circulation isn’t cut off. Bondage is inherently risky, and you’ll want to do some research before deciding if you’d like to try it. You’ll also want to be cautious with who you’re allowing to restrain you. Do you know them? Do they have experience and knowledge on mitigating the risks? Establish trust, rapport, and effective communication before proceeding with anything that you can’t immediately extricate yourself from.&lt;/p&gt;

Even with a person twice your size, you aren’t going to full-on fight them the way you would an attacker. There’s already an element of fantasy at work for this kind of interaction to be safe enough to engage in.&lt;/p&gt;

If that’s the case, remember that your desires are OK. You can give yourself permission to seek out people who are able and want to meet your desires. Lots of people prefer certain body types or have a tendency toward certain physical characteristics. You get to have preferences too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="261" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2st05000d3b6itg5d1fur@published"&gt;For most of high school, I assumed that my hormones were just on backorder and that I was a really late bloomer. However, I’m in college now, and I’m realizing that I’m probably asexual but heteroromantic. It was a relief when I first found out this was “a thing”—I always felt self-conscious because I never really got the appeal of sex, and I thought there was something wrong with me. However, I’m starting to realize how incredibly hard it’s going to be to date guys. I’m not sex-repulsed, just kind of &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; on the topic. I could foresee myself maybe having sex with someone if I really liked them, but that wouldn’t be for a very long time. All of that goes to say that I’m not sure how to date or even if it’s morally OK for me to date. It doesn’t seem fair to deprive someone of sex just because I’m not into it, and it’s pretty hard to find other people who have no particular interest in sex but still want a relationship. The only solution I can think of is maybe nonmonogamy, but I don’t know how I’d feel about that in a long-term relationship. I would love to get married someday, but I can’t see how that’s possible without sex. Do I just have to suck it up and realize that I can’t always get what I want, that dating this way isn’t fair to others, and throw myself into fulfilling friendships instead of love? Or is there some way for me to move around this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2sszu00093b6ivt03dre1@published"&gt;Yes, you’re overthinking this. I’m guessing that you’ve been through a large process of life planning recently—what you want to study, informed by what direction you want your career to take—and I’m wondering if you’re feeling pressure to figure out the romantic aspect of your life in the grand sense, too. If that’s the case, you might consider giving yourself a break. You don’t have to have it all figured out right now. It seems like you’re currently borrowing a lot of frustration from your potential future self.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2st0b000e3b6iqm0fouae@published"&gt;You’re correct that the majority of people &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; allosexual—meaning they regularly experience sexual attraction. So yes, you’ll encounter more people who are frequently aroused than those who rarely or never want sex. The thing is that most of us allosexuals have criteria—based on sexual orientation, faith or political beliefs, and aesthetic preferences—that drastically narrow the field of possible mates. And a person being allosexual doesn’t necessarily mean that sex, or frequent sex, is something they require. It isn’t so much that you can’t always get what you want, as it is that—like most people—you’ll have to spend significant time looking. You’ll also probably experience rejection, disappointment, and hurt along the way. It’s part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

What is your idea of marriage, and why do you want that? Is there something about the idea of nonmonogamy in a long-term relationship that feels scary or otherwise unacceptable? And what does romance look like for you? Is it giving each other flowers? Netflix and actually chill? What makes those things different from friendship? These are all things worth contemplating, without needing to have any answers or decisions right now.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t feel horny, I don’t masturbate, and it doesn’t feel good to me. I’ve just always done it because that’s what you’re supposed to do in a relationship. As I get older, I find myself wanting to go along with it less and less.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of the brain, is the central driver of various human capabilities, including decision-making, perception, language and memory. Understanding how the morphology (i.e., structure and shape) of people's cerebral cortex is related to their mental health is a long-standing goal for many neuroscientists, as it could help to predict the risk that people will develop specific neuropsychiatric conditions while also contributing to their diagnosis and potentially informing their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Maastricht University Medical Centre, Utrecht University and other institutes recently carried out a study aimed at unveiling causal relationships between cortical morphology and traits, including both neuropsychiatric conditions, behavioral patterns and metabolic traits. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00397-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the total surface area (TSA) of the cerebral cortex and mean cortical thickness (MCT) contribute to people's mental abilities and the development of some severe mental health disorders, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Brain cortical morphology, indexed by its surface area and thickness, is known to be highly heritable," wrote Bochao Danae Lin, Yunzhi Li and their colleagues in their paper. "Previous research has suggested a relationship of cortical morphology with several neuropsychiatric phenotypes. However, the multitude of potential confounders makes it difficult to establish causal relationships."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their study, the researchers analyzed a large amount of data sourced from a large genome-wide database, which was compiled as part of the Enhancing Neuro-Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) study. This is a brain-imaging study that collected brain imaging data, as well as psychiatric, psychological, behavioral and metabolic information from individuals living in 43 countries worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We employ generalized summary-data-based Mendelian randomization and a series of sensitivity analyses to investigate causal links between 70 cortical morphology measures and 199 neuropsychiatric, behavioral and metabolic phenotypes," wrote Lin, Li and their colleagues. "We show that total brain cortical surface area (TSA) has significant positive causal effects on 18 phenotypes."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze the data sourced from the ENIGMA database, Lin, Li and their colleagues employed a statistical technique called Mendelian randomization, which is useful for estimating causal relationships between traits while also controlling for potentially confounding factors. Their findings suggest that the TSA of the cerebral cortex is in fact causally related to some mental abilities, particularly their cognitive performance (i.e., how well they can memorize information, their ability to focus on specific tasks, their reasoning skills and other mental capabilities).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"The strongest effects include TSA positively influencing cognitive performance, while reverse analyses reveal small effects of cognitive performance on TSA," wrote Lin, Li and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Global mean cortical thickness (MTH) exhibits significant causal effects on five phenotypes, including schizophrenia. MTH reduces schizophrenia risk, and bidirectional causality is found between MTH and smoking initiation. Finally, in regional analyses, we detect positive influences of the transverse temporal surface area on cognitive performance and negative influences of transverse temporal thickness on schizophrenia risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results of the analyses performed by this team of researchers suggest that cortical morphology does in fact affect both people's mental capabilities and neuropsychiatric traits. The causal relationships identified by Lin, Li and his colleagues could be explored further in future neuroscience studies, potentially helping to improve the early diagnosis and treatment of specific disorders, including schizophrenia and some cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results highlight bidirectional associations between TSA, MTH and neuropsychiatric traits," wrote Lin, Li and their colleagues. "These insights offer potential avenues for intervention studies aimed at improving brain health."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;We should all be checking our feet and toenails regularly as they play a 'huge role' in our overall health, a doctor said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Yellow discolouration (left) could indicate a toenail infection while dark nail stripes (right) could signal a type of skin cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;YELLOW DISCOLOURATION&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can indicate a toenail infection, Ms Bagga explained, and it can occur on any part of the nail. It causes the nail to discolour, become crumbly or thicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another cause can be nail psoriasis, where the nail plate can become pitted with patches or lift up from the nail bed underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help prevent toenail infections, it's good practice to keep your nails short, clean, and tidy, she advised. It's also important to wear a clean pair of socks every day and wear shoes that fit correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;DARK NAIL STRIPES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is known as Melanonychia, which can appear as a brown or black band running lengthwise along the nail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the time it is simply a normal variation in the pigmentation of the nail. However, in some rare cases, it is a tell-tale sign of Subungual Melanoma, a type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To help prevent Melanonychia, it's crucial to focus on good nail and foot hygiene,' Ms Bagga said. 'You also want to try and avoid any nail trauma - if you do injure your nail, allow it to fully heal properly and avoid picking at it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A mother-of-one is urging people not to ignore mysterious marks on nails after what she thought was a simple bruise turned out to be a deadly form of cancer . Laura Jennings, 40, from Leeds, first noticed a dark streak beneath her toenail in April 2022, but thought nothing of it. It turned out to be a deadly form of skin cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Swollen toes could indicate gout, which is more likely to occur in people who are overweight, while white spots on the nails can be caused by a deficiency of protein, zinc or iron&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;SWOLLEN TOES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can be caused by a number of conditions including lymphatic issues, poor blood flow, or even gout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis characterised by sudden, severe joint pain, often in the big toe, caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. It is more likely to occur in people who are overweight, and consuming a healthy diet that aids weight loss can help manage the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile there are less serious causes of toe swelling such as sitting or standing for long periods of time, wearing shoes that are too small, being overweight, dehydrated, or eating a diet that's heavy in salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet can help with some of these common issues, along with regular exercise and movement,' Ms Bagga advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;WHITE TOENAILS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White lines or spots on the nail. also called 'leukonychia', are often caused by trauma such as stubbing your toe. However sometimes they can be a sign of deficiencies in protein, zinc, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although rare, fully white nails are slightly more concerning and could be an indicator of a systematic illness in another part of the body, Ms Bagga warned, including liver cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If your toes feel unusually cold and lose their colour (left) it could be a sign they are not getting proper circulation. Meanwhile Athletes Foot is a common fungal infection that shows as itchy white patches between your toes (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;BLUE DISCOLOURATION&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your nails have a bluish hue and you notice that your toes feel unusually cold, it may be a sign that they are not getting proper circulation, Ms Bagga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a common symptom of a condition called Raynaud's disease, which causes narrowing of the smaller arteries which supply blood to the extremities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regular exercise can help improve blood circulation, which can be beneficial for managing the symptoms of Raynaud's, alongside helping you maintain a healthy weight,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;ITCHY TOES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Athletes Foot is a common fungal infection that shows as itchy white patches between your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also affect the soles or sides of your feet, sometimes causing fluid-filled blisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help prevent Athlete's Foot, make sure to completely dry your feet after washing them, especially between your toes, Ms Bagga said, as well as wearing clean socks every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If nails change shape or look curved and 'spoon'-like it could indicate an iron deficiency or aneamia, the doctor said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;ULCERS ON TOES OR FEET&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike a blister that occurs under the skin, an ulcer is a break in the skin's surface, appearing as an open wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's very important that these are looked after to reduce any risks of infection, the doctor warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During the time the wound is exposed, it can leave you vulnerable to developing an infection, which in serious cases can lead to amputation,' Ms Bagga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;SPOON NAILS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bagga advised that people inspect their toenails on a regular basis, as if they start to change shape and look curved or 'spoon'-like, it could indicate an iron deficiency or anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is essential for producing healthy red blood cells and maintaining proper nail health, so it's important to speak to a healthcare provider who may recommend taking a supplement, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-67ac8900-4841-11f0-8dda-05c9819dbfad"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-41d464b0-8dbb-11e9-aef0-fdb94fbba61e" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-7137041/WHAT-INGROWN-TOENAIL.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ingrown toenail is a 'common' problem that occurs when the nail grows into the toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An affected digit may be red, painful or swollen. The nail may also curve into the toe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of an infection include pus oozing out of the toe and feeling hot or shivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingrown nails can usually be treated at home by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soaking the foot in warm water three-to-four times a day for a few days to soften the skin and stop the nail growing into it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping the foot dry for the rest of the day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing wide, comfortable shoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Taking painkillers if necessary &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ingrown-toenail/"&gt;NHS &lt;/a&gt;advises we leave the nail to grow out rather than cutting or picking at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the at-home treatment does not work, or the toe is painful or appears to be infected, see a GP. Patients should also seek the help of a doctor if they have a fever or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A foot specialist may then cut away part of the nail or remove it entirely. A local anaesthetic will first be applied to numb the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingrown toenails can be prevented by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not cutting nails too short&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cutting straight across the nail rather than at the edges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Not wearing shoes that are too tight or do not fit properly &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 11:06:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNUy1rTlVMeXQtU1J3Sk00ZU9wdjl5R2R4RXpMMFZCSGd2TUtRNmpHSkd2dzZsd3d6QUV3dmU5YzYzNFZ1c1JXMk1LQnc5OE9BaXRXMWt6R01zeWNQRjlIQ0FUSGYyRi1DNVIwb0hjeXBPYnJEbDIxeGRSQ213aUM5T21zMUh0dmtMMXhYSGtnS2lyZDJsZXFWZnpzVFdyeTNmSmZj</guid></item><item><title>透露：根据专家的说法，您的脚趾甲对您有什么影响-每日邮报 | Revealed: What your TOENAILS say about you, according to experts - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNUy1rTlVMeXQtU1J3Sk00ZU9wdjl5R2R4RXpMMFZCSGd2TUtRNmpHSkd2dzZsd3d6QUV3dmU5YzYzNFZ1c1JXMk1LQnc5OE9BaXRXMWt6R01zeWNQRjlIQ0FUSGYyRi1DNVIwb0hjeXBPYnJEbDIxeGRSQ213aUM5T21zMUh0dmtMMXhYSGtnS2lyZDJsZXFWZnpzVFdyeTNmSmZj0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1xWkp6ZXhMZV9BVVZ0WjRFcG5nekYtUTd4YVhDc0xpc0taaGF5bW1kMjUwWV9fUnBiQnk0amZ4a2JGY3ZrZGxrYmlUZ3hkU2QxWi1KdXBNTTZxU0pZaEtVRnNzdExkT0lINXFqWC1BWUIyUWtXdmJEcEwwTWxfRGZlMnE4QnJkM2NLSDByenNVSG1LdzlsZDY0VFMzZXRNR3Q3TVFJNFBnbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You probably don't pay them much attention on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But your toenails could tell you a lot about your health, a doctor has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether it's nutritional deficiencies, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-aeddc5e0-483d-11f0-8dda-05c9819dbfad"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or circulatory issues, checking the condition of your nails could highlight issues such as infections, diabetes or even &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-aedd0290-483d-11f0-8dda-05c9819dbfad"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sheena Bagga, a pharmacist prescriber from &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/uk/lifestyle-advice/health-trends-calendar"&gt;LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed everything you need to know about toe and nail health – and eight symptoms to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While often overlooked, your toenails and feet play a huge role in your overall health and it's important to pay attention to their condition,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While everyone's toes look different, healthy nails should have a smooth surface with light pink or translucent colouration without much variation in shade or hue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While a lot of the time problems with toes and nails are easily treated, if you are facing symptoms due to issues such as diabetes, poor circulation, or nutritional deficiencies, consuming a healthy, balanced diet is crucial to support your overall health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, do you recognise any of these symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;

Patients should also seek the help of a doctor if they have a fever or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A foot specialist may then cut away part of the nail or remove it entirely.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpaceX tries something new with Falcon 9. &lt;/b&gt;With nearly 500 launches under its belt, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket isn't often up to new tricks. But the company tried something new following a launch June 7 with a radio broadcasting satellite for SiriusXM. The Falcon 9's upper stage placed the SXM-10 satellite into an elongated, high-altitude transfer orbit, as is typical for payloads destined to operate in geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. When a rocket releases a satellite in this type of high-energy orbit, the upper stage has usually burned almost all of its propellant, leaving little fuel left over to steer itself back into Earth's atmosphere for a destructive reentry. This means these upper stages often remain in space for decades, becoming a piece of space junk transiting across the orbits of many other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, a solution &lt;/em&gt;... SpaceX usually deorbits rockets after they deploy payloads like Starlink satellites into low-Earth orbit, but deorbiting a rocket from a much higher geosynchronous transfer orbit is a different matter. "Last week, SpaceX successfully completed a controlled deorbit of the SiriusXM-10 upper stage after GTO payload deployment," wrote Jon Edwards, SpaceX's vice president of Falcon and Dragon programs. "While we routinely do controlled deorbits for LEO stages (e.g., Starlink), deorbiting from GTO is extremely difficult due to the high energy needed to alter the orbit, making this a rare and remarkable first for us. This was only made possible due to the hard work and brilliance of the Falcon GNC (guidance, navigation, and control) team and exemplifies SpaceX's commitment to leading in both space exploration and public safety."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Glenn gets a tentative launch date. &lt;/b&gt;Five months have passed since Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket made its mostly successful debut in January. At one point the company targeted "late spring" for the second launch of the rocket. However, on Monday, Blue Origin's CEO, Dave Limp, acknowledged on social media that the rocket's next flight will now no longer take place until at least August 15, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/second-new-glenn-launch-slips-toward-fall-as-program-leadership-departs/"&gt;Ars reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although he did not say so, this may well be the only other New Glenn launch this year. The mission, with an undesignated payload, will be named "Never Tell Me the Odds," due to the attempt to land the booster. "One of our key mission objectives will be to land and recover the booster," &lt;a href="https://x.com/davill/status/1932113352714825833"&gt;Limp wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "This will take a little bit of luck and a lot of excellent execution. We’re on track to produce eight GS2s [second stages] this year, and the one we’ll fly on this second mission was hot-fired in April."&lt;/p&gt;

Study authors also published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a 30-year study that started in 1985. It included 4,654 adults, almost 55% women, with an average age of 25 when the study began—also called the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ diets were assessed at baseline and again at years 7 and 20. Specifically, researchers were looking for the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290373/a-buyers-guide-to-sugar-substitutes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cumulative average intake of artificial sweeteners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;cumulative average intake of artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, diet beverages, aspartame and sucralose. Participants were placed into categories, called quintiles, based on their intake of these substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were also looking for diabetes diagnoses over the 30 years of follow-up, of which there were 691 cases. They defined diabetes as a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290761/best-time-to-check-blood-glucose-after-meal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, glucose 200 mg/dL or higher after a glucose tolerance test, A1C higher than 6.5%, or the use of diabetes medications at follow-up visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Study Show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses were adjusted for certain demographics, including age, sex, race, education, energy intake, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, diet quality and family history of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who consumed the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043120/trader-joes-best-beverages-for-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most diet beverages;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;most diet beverages&lt;/a&gt; had a 129% higher risk of diabetes compared to those who drank the least diet beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to those with lower intakes, those with the highest intake of saccharin, an artificial sweetener sometimes found in diet drinks, had a 110% increased risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know it’s important to limit sugar, and beverages sweetened with sugar can be a major contributor of added sugar in our diets. But this study suggests that replacing regular sodas and other sweetened beverages with diet ones may not benefit you in the ways you’re hoping. It also suggests that they may even significantly raise your risk of developing diabetes—exactly the opposite of what you might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific community has gone back and forth on the safety of artificial sweeteners. And while the FDA lists artificial sweeteners as “generally recognized as safe,” we also know that research is mixed on sugar substitutes—particularly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:when it comes to your gut health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;when it comes to your gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study didn’t include sugar alcohols, a type of artificial sweetener, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-study-links-erythritol-with-higher-blood-clot-risk-8695390" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that they, too, may pose some risk, including for blood clots, which increase the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-to-eat-for-lower-stroke-risk-11722148" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of stroke and heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;risk of stroke and heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study raises a lot of questions, which is a good thing with research. We still need more information to know if it’s only the artificial sweeteners raising the risk of diabetes, or if it's the combination of artificial sweeteners with other additives in the beverages. We also can’t know for sure if other additives in the drinks increase diabetes risk on their own, or if it’s a combination of the diet drinks and a poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all these questions, here’s what we do know. Soda is far from being a whole food, but everything can fit in a varied and balanced eating pattern. Having a soda now and then is probably fine for most people. The key is how regularly you’re taking a soda break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you lean on your favorite fizzy pop to get you through a midafternoon slump, consider replacing it with an &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/energizing-nut-free-snack-recipes-8549709" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:energizing snack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;energizing snack&lt;/a&gt;, like some nuts and cheese for a mix of &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein and healthy fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;protein and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;. You could even take a quick walk or do some pushups against your desk to get your blood pumping. Changing your physiology is one of the quickest ways to change your energy state. And making sure you’re staying well-hydrated and well-fueled may help prevent the slump to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like soda for the bubbles, consider replacing it with an unsweetened &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052890/sparkling-water-soda-water-club-soda-seltzer-water-mineral-water-tonic-whats-the-difference/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sparkling water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll get all of the fizz without the additives that soda contains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that those who drink high amounts of diet sodas and other diet beverages may significantly increase their risk of diabetes. Soda, whether sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners, may be a delicious option now and then, but should probably not be a regular on anyone’s menu. If you’re a regular soda imbiber, begin replacing one soda a day with &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-gut-friendly-soda-is-my-go-to-drink-for-dry-january-8772967" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:natural beverages;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;natural beverages&lt;/a&gt;, including water, sparkling water or unsweetened tea.

The drug helped restore more normal sleep patterns and limited the buildup of tau, a protein known to damage neurons. The findings raise the possibility that medications targeting the brain’s sleep-wake system could one day help prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and shrinking of brain tissue over time. One of its key features is the buildup of tau, a protein that normally helps stabilize the internal structure of brain cells. In Alzheimer’s, tau becomes chemically altered in a way that causes it to clump together and form tangles inside neurons. These tangles disrupt communication between brain cells and contribute to their eventual death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although sleep disturbances are common in Alzheimer’s, researchers are increasingly viewing poor sleep not just as a symptom of the disease, but as a possible contributing factor to its progression. A growing body of research has linked reduced time spent in restorative non-REM and REM sleep to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative conditions. One of the mechanisms thought to underlie this relationship involves a system in the brain that helps regulate wakefulness, known as orexin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orexin is a neuropeptide produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It plays a central role in keeping us awake and alert by stimulating activity in wake-promoting areas of the brain. In healthy individuals, orexin levels rise during the day to promote alertness and fall at night to allow sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in people with sleep disturbances—and in animal models of Alzheimer’s—orexin signaling can become overactive, contributing to fragmented sleep and increased time spent awake. Notably, orexin-producing neurons are among the earliest to show damage in Alzheimer’s and related tau disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Investigating the role of orexin signaling as a potential therapeutic treatment for pathological tau was the next step in a broader line of investigation the lab has been following for a while. We have known that sleep loss is a risk for Alzheimer’s for a long time,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://sleepresearch.wustl.edu/people/samira-parhizkar-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Samira Parhizkar&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previously, we had looked into how knocking out orexin receptors affects amyloid pathology, one of the key hallmark proteins in Alzheimer’s disease, in mice. From that, we already knew orexin signaling was tied into sleep regulation and disease processes. But since tau pathology, another key characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease —rather than amyloid—is more tightly linked with actual brain atrophy and cognitive decline, we wanted to shift focus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s where lemborexant came in,” Parhizkar explained. “It’s a clinically approved drug for treating insomnia that blocks orexin receptors – peptides in the brain that keep us awake and alert. We figured if it could normalize sleep, and hit that same orexin pathway, maybe it could also prevent some of the tau-related damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers used a genetically engineered mouse model that mimics key features of Alzheimer’s disease. These mice, called P301S/E4 mice, carry both a human tau mutation and the human APOE4 gene, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s. These mice begin to show significant tau buildup, brain inflammation, and brain shrinkage by about 9.5 months of age. Importantly, they also show disrupted sleep-wake cycles, making them a useful model for studying the connection between sleep and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We investigated the effects of lemborexant, which is partially selective for orexin receptor 2 and primarily influences sleep/wake regulation, in the P301S/E4 mouse model of tau-mediated neurodegeneration,” Parhizkar said. “This model exhibits both sleep disturbances and brain atrophy with accumulating tau pathology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared lemborexant’s effects to those of zolpidem, a commonly prescribed sleep aid that works through a different mechanism. Starting at 7.5 months of age, the mice were treated daily with one of the drugs or a control solution. Sleep was measured using both EEG recordings and motion sensors, and brain tissues were analyzed after two months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemborexant increased the amount of non-REM sleep in male mice, especially when administered in the early evening (ZT13). This increase in deep sleep was associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated tau in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex—regions essential for memory. Immunohistochemistry revealed that mice treated with lemborexant had fewer tau tangles, and biochemical analyses showed a reduction in tau proteins phosphorylated at sites associated with disease progression. Zolpidem, while also promoting sleep, did not significantly reduce tau levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its effects on tau, lemborexant appeared to protect the brain’s structure and function. Treated mice showed less shrinkage in key brain regions and thicker layers of neurons in the dentate gyrus and piriform cortex. They also had lower levels of neurofilament light chain in the blood, a marker of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, lemborexant-treated mice retained more synaptic structures, as shown by markers of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. These mice also showed reduced microglial activation, suggesting less brain inflammation. The drug appeared to shift microglia—the brain’s immune cells—away from a reactive, potentially damaging state and toward a more homeostatic role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We initially hypothesized that enhancing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which is closely linked to deep sleep, could help mitigate the damage caused by abnormal tau in the brain,” Parhizkar told PsyPost. “What was surprising was that these effects were not seen with a standard sleep drug like zolpidem that increases NREM sleep similarly to lemborexant. This suggests that the benefit is not just about more sleep, but rather how that sleep is promoted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how lemborexant might be reducing tau pathology, the researchers looked at downstream molecular pathways. They found that lemborexant reduced levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), a key enzyme known to phosphorylate tau. This suggests that blocking orexin signaling can suppress a molecular cascade that leads to abnormal tau modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested this idea in a second experiment, using mice genetically engineered to lack orexin receptor 2. When these mice were injected with pathological tau extracted from human Alzheimer’s brains, they showed significantly less tau seeding and spreading compared to normal mice. This effect was similar to that seen in mice treated with lemborexant, reinforcing the idea that orexin receptor 2 plays a key role in tau pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another surprising finding was that protein kinase A, an enzyme recognized for decades for its role in promoting formation of abnormal tau found in disease states, could be affected by changes in the orexin signaling pathway,” Parhizkar said. “By showing both pharmacologic (lemborexant) and genetic (orexin receptor 2 knockout) approaches having similar effects, the study makes a strong case that orexin signaling may be a modifiable driver of tau pathology, not just a bystander.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the protective effects of lemborexant were mostly seen in male mice. Female mice did not show the same reductions in tau buildup or brain atrophy, despite experiencing similar improvements in sleep. This sex difference is consistent with other studies showing that male and female animals can respond differently to both Alzheimer’s pathology and pharmacological interventions. The reason for this difference remains unclear but may involve hormonal influences or differences in baseline tau accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although lemborexant showed strong protective effects at the molecular and structural levels, its impact on behavior was limited. The only behavioral improvement observed was a modest enhancement in a spontaneous alternation task, which measures exploratory behavior. The lack of improvement in more memory-focused tasks, such as fear conditioning, may be due to the fact that lemborexant’s protective effects were stronger in the entorhinal cortex than in the hippocampus, which is more directly involved in those tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that a sleep aid can prevent atrophy in the brain typically observed with build-up of abnormal tau, suggesting that targeting sleep through dual orexin receptor antagonism may have broader therapeutic potential beyond symptom management with potential protective effects on the brain,” Parhizkar told PsyPost. “This opens the door to repurposing orexin antagonists—already approved for insomnia—as a potential disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer’s and additional tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, there are some limitations to consider. The study was conducted in mice, so it is unclear whether the findings will generalize to humans. The treatment began before significant tau pathology had developed, meaning the drug’s effects on established disease remain unknown. The researchers also did not test other orexin receptor antagonists or explore the long-term effects of treatment beyond two months. Moreover, the reason why only male mice benefited remains to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Significant questions remain before lemborexant could be recommended for preventing Alzheimer’s disease in humans,” Parhizkar noted. “For example, we need more evidence to determine whether long-term use is effective in preventing cognitive decline and which individuals may benefit from it. Although these findings are encouraging, it is still early days. We now have evidence that dual orexin antagonists can influence levels of both amyloid and tau, which could potentially delay the progression of Alzheimer’s disease if treatment begins before or during the early stages of mild cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team is planning additional studies to better understand the mechanisms behind lemborexant’s protective effects and to explore whether combining different therapeutic approaches might be more effective than current options, either alone or in combination with other available treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01966-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lemborexant ameliorates tau-mediated sleep loss and neurodegeneration in males in a mouse model of tauopathy&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Samira Parhizkar, Xin Bao, Wei Chen, Nicholas Rensing, Yun Chen, Michal Kipnis, Sihui Song, Grace Gent, Eric Tycksen, Melissa Manis, Choonghee Lee, Javier Remolina Serrano, Megan E.

These so-called poop transplants have understandably received a lot of attention, but new research casts a bit of a wet blanket over the practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The procedure involves taking microbes from the poop of a healthy person and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/need-a-fecal-transplant-theres-a-poop-bank-for-that-1521772837"&gt;&lt;span&gt;transferring them into a patient’s colon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This should restore balance to their gut microbiome, but according to a study published June 6 in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00564-1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, transplanted microbes may colonize the wrong parts of the digestive system. This can result in long-lasting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fecal-transplant-patient-killed-by-superbug-traced-to-d-1835521476"&gt;&lt;span&gt;unintended health consequences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the researchers warn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think it’s a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn’t willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn’t be there.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think it’s a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn’t willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn’t be there,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/fecal-transplants-can-have-unintended-side-effects-study-finds"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lead author Orlando “Landon” DeLeon, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago, in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeLeon led a team of researchers through a series of experiments on mice to determine how fecal matter transplants affect different parts of the intestine. The mice were separated into three groups. One received microbes from the jejunum (the middle part of the small intestine), the second received microbes from the cecum (a pouch that connects the small intestine to the colon), and the third received a standard fecal transplant from the colon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each part of the digestive system contains uniquely adapted microbiota. The researchers wanted to see if the microbes would stick to their respective niches once inside the mice. In fact, they found that each of the transplants successfully colonized the full intestinal tract, creating regional gut “mismatches” that lasted for up to three months after the procedure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microbes that colonized parts of the gut where they didn’t belong triggered metabolic changes in these intestinal regions, with the potential to affect a patient’s health and behavior. The researchers observed changes in the mice’s eating habits, activity, and energy expenditure following the transplants. They also documented changes in gene activity associated with immune function, which in turn led to changes in liver metabolism. Most surprising was the manner in which these foreign microbes altered gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining to make the mismatched gut region more suitable for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s like they’re engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in,” DeLeon said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To determine whether these mismatches could occur in actual fecal transplant patients, he and his colleagues conducted additional tests using human tissue samples. Results showed that transplanted gut bacteria can colonize parts of the human digestive system where they don’t naturally belong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If we’re designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits,” DeLeon said. For example, the findings suggest it may be safer to use microbes retrieved from all the parts of the digestive system, according to the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25202-fecal-transplant"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; fecal transplants for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-taboo-treatment-how-fecal-transplants-save-lives-5893234"&gt;&lt;span&gt;treating repeated infections of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or C. diff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This bacterium—which can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms—most commonly sickens hospital patients who have been treated with antibiotics. Fecal transplants have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/medical-advances/science-and-research/how-do-fecal-transplants-work"&gt;&lt;span&gt;proven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to be highly effective for treating these infections, and those results have encouraged researchers to investigate other applications for this procedure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A wave of new research suggests that fecal transplants could treat conditions that go beyond the gut. Indeed, studies have found that this procedure could benefit patients with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10017995/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;neurodevelopmental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7294648/#:~:text=All%20studies%20found%20a%20decrease,the%20transplantation%20of%20healthy%20microbiota."&gt;&lt;span&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10745313/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, type 2 diabetes, and more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeLeon’s findings suggest that doctors need to better understand the risks of fecal matter transplants before this treatment can be used for diseases other than C. diff. He plans to keep investigating how different microbes affect each part of the intestine and explore ways to restore altered regions to their original state. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This study shows that when it comes to gut microbes, location really matters. Getting the right bugs in the right place could unlock the full potential of fecal transplants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who was an anti-vaccine activist before taking a role in the administration, announced May 27 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;no longer recommend COVID vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant women or healthy children, bypassing the agency's formal process for adjusting its vaccine schedules for adults and kids. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The announcement, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;made on the social media platform X&lt;/a&gt;, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The HHS document meant to support Kennedy's decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress, according to Democratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the office of Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titled "Covid Recommendation FAQ", the document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy's announcement from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p id="resnx-s1-5431935-101" class="bucketwrap statichtml"&gt;
            
   &lt;/p&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;Medical experts who reviewed all the citations in the FAQ said it distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News: "There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS did not respond to a request to name the author of the document.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241226566" target="_blank"&gt;One of the studies&lt;/a&gt; the HHS document cites is under investigation by its publisher, Sage Journals, regarding "potential issues with the research methodology and conclusions and author conflicts of interest," according to a link on &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241239903" target="_blank"&gt;the study's webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This is RFK Jr.'s playbook," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/about/faculty-staff-directory/O-Leary-Sean-UCD11631" target="_blank"&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. "Either cherry-pick from good science or take junk science to support his premise — this has been his playbook for 20 years."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Outdated and misinterpreted research about myocarditis and pericarditis&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.20.24306810v1" target="_blank"&gt;study cited&lt;/a&gt; in the document is a preprint that was made available online a year ago, and has still not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Under the study's title is an alert that "it reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-72530" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The FAQ draws on the preprint to claim that "post-marketing studies" of COVID vaccines have identified "serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis" — conditions in which the heart's muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While research early in the pandemic did find that, new research not included in the memo indicates that the risk has fallen with new vaccine protocols.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the HHS document omitted numerous other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39404761/" target="_blank"&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; studies that have shown that the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39826014/" target="_blank"&gt;risk of myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; and pericarditis is greater after contracting COVID for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One the 2024 preprint coauthors &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/08/myocarditis-vaccinated-covid-19-oxford-fact-check/74639942007/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;refuted the idea&lt;/a&gt; that their research found myocarditis and pericarditis were caused by the COVID shots, rather than COVID infection, noting that the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the COVID virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also focused only on children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;O'Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the COVID pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of COVID vaccines were spaced further apart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O'Leary said, referring to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/vsd/index.html#cdc_generic_section_5-access-and-use-vsd-data" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Safety Datalink&lt;/a&gt;. "There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Congress relies on health agencies for accurate guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims about dangers to pregnant women that are &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17721" target="_blank"&gt;actively refuted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2022/04000/in_vitro_fertilization_and_early_pregnancy.3.aspx%C2%A0" target="_blank"&gt;the papers&lt;/a&gt; it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The HHS document says that another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24001270?via%3Dihub#s0090" target="_blank"&gt;paper it cites&lt;/a&gt; found "an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine." But the paper doesn't contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere," said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If he were grading the HHS document, "I would give this an 'F,'" Turrentine said. "This is not supported by anything and it's not using medical evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/neil-silverman" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Silverman,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document," Silverman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash., a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Rep. Schrier's office did receive a copy of the document.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don't have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart," O'Leary said."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration's policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This feels like it's breaking new ground. I don't think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration," Young said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Pastor Billiance Chondwe has known 9-year-old Diana Lungu since she was born. He helped her mother through a rough pregnancy and during Diana's early years. Diana's mother died of AIDS when Diana was nearing her third birthday.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Night had fallen hours ago, but Billiance Chondwe was not slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Feb. 20, he frantically tapped out texts on WhatsApp, dialed distant acquaintances and left voice messages from his home in Zambia. He'd pause only to close his eyes and think of whom else he could reach out to for help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He urgently needed to find medication for Diana Lungu. She's an orphan, she's 9 — and she's HIV-positive. She'd run out of the daily pills she takes to suppress the virus. Without the pills, the virus would surge back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I called the whole night … calling everyone," remembers Chondwe, 53, a reverend known in his community simply as Pastor Billy. "I slept around 3 a.m."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;One of his messages found its way to Thailand, where Susan Hillis was standing in an airport check-in line. It was the wee hours of the morning there, and she was heading home to the U.S. from a conference of Christian mission hospitals. As she listened to the message, Hillis could sense the exhaustion and fear in Pastor Billy's voice — and she knew how much Diana means to him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was about four people from checking in, and I had tears in my eyes and was choked up," recalls Hillis, an epidemiologist who has spent years on HIV/AIDS work. "I was thinking: 'She's going to die. She is going to die.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was through her work in the faith community that she first connected with Pastor Billy — and learned about Diana, a girl with short cropped hair and a cautious but bright smile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Pastor Billy and his wife, Catherine Nanyangwe Chondwe, have taken more than 15 orphans into their home — raising them for periods of time alongside their own five children. "Some were sleeping in the kitchen, others in the sitting room," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71246" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Diana lost her mother to HIV and her grandmother to COVID-19. She never knew her father. Pastor Billy says whatever stability she has had in her life is in large part thanks to the U.S. government.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Diana stayed with them on and off for four years. There was something different about her, they say&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— a generosity that took them both by surprise. "Maybe there is tea, or there is porridge, but any child nearby — [Diana] would share with them," Pastor Billy says. The same thing happened when they gave her toys.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;An AIDS orphan who is HIV-positive herself, Diana has lost her mother to HIV and her grandmother to COVID-19. She never knew her father. Pastor Billy says whatever stability she has had in her life is in large part thanks to the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana's HIV medications and her medical care have been provided by a U.S.-funded clinic with a big salmon-colored gate in her town of Kapiri Mposhi. And a U.S. program supporting AIDS orphans provided Diana with monthly food packages — often fish, beans and cornmeal. Proper nutrition is critical when taking HIV drugs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PEPFAR — the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — paid for all of it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came inauguration night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Half a world away, in Washington, D.C., President Trump signed an executive order with a Sharpie, freezing almost all foreign aid. A flurry of stop-work orders followed, as did program terminations for billions of dollars of international health programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;From one day to the next, Diana's HIV clinic went from providing lifesaving medications to closing its doors. There was no warning and no time to get her medical file and transfer it to another clinic. The monthly package of food also stopped without warning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By that time, Pastor Billy's church had transferred him to a different town. He'd found someone in Diana's community — Jennifer Mukuka — to welcome her in.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71247" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"I don't have much, but I just have this big heart," says Mukuka. She has been able to bear the cost of raising Diana because of the aid from PEPFAR, which also covered fees for her school books and uniform.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And that kind of security has given Diana space to dream of her own future. On her 20-minute walk to school — down dusty, craggy roads — she often imagines becoming a doctor, with a white coat and stethoscope, moving from one bedside to the next.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On that February night — when Pastor Billy reached out to Hillis and almost a dozen others — he had just learned that Diana had run out of her daily HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hillis remembers thinking to herself in that airport line: "If it's happening to her, it's happening to a lot of people."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71518" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Successful" and "unsung"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana was one of 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children supported last year by PEPFAR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PEPFAR spokespeople often point out that the program has saved more than 26 million lives since its launch in 2003. And it has also helped children on a massive scale. Starting in 2006 — just a few years after then-President George W. Bush created the initiative — a bipartisan team of Democrats and Republicans made sure that 10% of the funding each year was set aside for AIDS orphans and vulnerable children. Last fiscal year, PEPFAR spent just over $200 million on these youngsters — about $31 per child supported.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;AIDS often kills people in their childbearing years and has left &lt;a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/hivaids/global-regional-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;millions of orphaned children&lt;/a&gt; in its wake. PEPFAR's vision was to enable local families to take in these orphans by providing basics — not only medicine but also food, clothing and school fees, as well as psychosocial support to address stigma. The program defined orphans as children who had lost one or both parents to AIDS, and the children did not necessarily have HIV themselves. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71250" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                The U.S. government's PEPFAR program provided AIDS orphans with food, clothing, school fees — and medicine if they were HIV-positive, like Diana. Now, without aid, Diana and the family she lives with are scrambling to provide these necessities. Here, Diana eats breakfast before heading to school.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cfar.ucsf.edu/people/eric-goosby" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Goosby&lt;/a&gt; — the infectious disease physician who oversaw PEPFAR from 2009 to 2013&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— says it's hard to overstate the impact of this program that is at once "very successful" and "largely unsung."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The orphan-and-vulnerable-children response that PEPFAR created was bigger than the Catholic Church, all added up in every country, in terms of the number of orphans saved," says Goosby, now a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "That was the largest effort on the planet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now it's mostly on hold.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said that while HIV treatment and care are allowed to continue, as well as prevention of mother-to-child transmission, "all other PEPFAR-funded services are being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The department did not respond to NPR's questions about when the review would be completed and what the 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children, as well as their caregivers, should do in the meantime. The statement did say that children and adults who are both HIV-positive and malnourished can get food support. While Diana has lost her food packages and is often hungry, she is not considered malnourished, according to Pastor Billy and Mukuka.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;How budget negotiations unfold will likely impact which parts of PEPFAR continue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Everything was stopped, and it's not coming back — except [HIV] treatment," says one U.S. civil servant who has spent years working at high levels on the United States' HIV/AIDS efforts and who requested anonymity because they are concerned that speaking out could harm their career. This civil servant said none of the staff members involved in the orphans program was moved to the State Department when the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was dismantled as an independent agency.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Since the foreign aid freeze was announced, &lt;a href="https://worldwithoutorphans.org/forum/speaker/susan-hillis" target="_blank"&gt;Hillis&lt;/a&gt; has been reaching out to her network of colleagues and friends all over the world to better understand their situation. That network was built up during the 25 years she spent at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a senior adviser with a focus on HIV and vulnerable children. She then spent seven years at PEPFAR. During Trump's first term, she was picked to lead a $100 million initiative to use faith-based groups to advance HIV/AIDS work. She was let go on the ninth day of Trump's second term.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Between emails, phone calls and text messages, Hillis has been keeping track of the situation on the ground in a variety of countries. "Now, a lot of families with orphans are hungry," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In that airport line in Thailand, Hillis remembers panicking about Diana's fate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71512" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"I just thought, 'This little girl's gonna die. She has no chance unless someone can get her medicine in the middle of rural Zambia. Who's gonna do that?'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashing back to the death of his twin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Pastor Billy, there was a very personal sense of urgency. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Growing up in Kitwe, Zambia, he was one of 13 children. During meals in the family's three-room house, he always sat next to his twin sister and best friend: Charity. "We [would] eat from the same plate," he says. And they'd play. She'd kick the soccer ball with him. He'd skip rope with her. "We were so close. It was lovely."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When the twins became teenagers, Pastor Billy says that a businessman lured Charity away. This businessman promised a more luxurious lifestyle than their family could offer. The twins' father was a cook at the local hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when Charity returned from spending time with the businessman, she was sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She developed something like a rash — when she pressed [the lesions], water [came out]," remembers Pastor Billy. The rash spread all over her face and arms and soon down to her legs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71256" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy lost his twin sister, Charity, to HIV/AIDS. After she was diagnosed in 1989, he cared for her at home. She died about two years later. "It brought me to my knees," he remembers.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;At the clinic in Kitwe, she was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. At the time, in 1989, there were no medications or treatments for AIDS in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Billy nursed her at home in their kitchen. Soon, she couldn't walk or even stand. Still today, he can instantly conjure up the image of her skeletal frame and the smell that permeated through the house as her condition deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes if I [was] out, she would be calling for me," he says. "There was one time I stopped going to school, like for a month, because she only wants me to be around."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Two years after her symptoms started, Charity died. "It brought me to my knees," Pastor Billy remembers. "It brought me to a point where [I realized] no matter what I can do as a human being, there is a limit. But at that time of sensing that limitation, I turned to God."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He became a pastor in 1994 as HIV/AIDS pounded the country and region. Until the 1980s, life expectancy had been steadily rising in Zambia. But as the HIV epidemic took off, life expectancy plummeted from 56 to 46 over the course of 15 years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Mahy of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71251" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;When PEPFAR was founded in 2003, there were &lt;a href="https://press.un.org/en/2003/afr773.doc.htm" target="_blank"&gt;more than 10 million children globally&lt;/a&gt; who had lost one or both parents to AIDS. "When children are deprived of a parent early in life, they have a significantly increased risk of exposure to violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, school dropout, poverty," explains Hillis. She co-authored a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00401-5/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;paper in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt; citing research showing that, across 14 countries, children who have lost one or both parents are at six times the risk of contracting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of what drove Bush to incorporate orphans and vulnerable children into PEPFAR was a religious sense of compassion, says &lt;a href="https://www.avenirhealth.org/profile.html?name=Stover" target="_blank"&gt;John Stover&lt;/a&gt;, vice president at Avenir Health, a group that analyzes data and policies for public health programs. "[Bush] had a lot of support from Christian groups — evangelicals and others — who were largely focused on improving the lot of children in Africa," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was also a practical reason for caring for this group of children, says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Duke Global Health Institute. Children who had lost their parents were "perceived to be very vulnerable to groups like militias and extremist organizations and gangs," he explains, pointing out that this was one of the reasons President Bill Clinton declared AIDS a threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"No, no, no, no, no"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pastor Billy also saw AIDS as a threat. As a new pastor, he saw members of his congregation start falling ill just like Charity had. "They were showing symptoms of my twin sister," he recalls. "I was like, 'No, no, no, no, no.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The funerals became so frequent that Pastor Billy was sometimes burying people several times a week. Even on Sunday, it would be a quick Mass and, then, to the graveyard. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When services wrapped up, he'd often have another time-sensitive task: figuring out what would happen to the orphaned children. He'd scramble to find relatives and community members to take them in, given the stigma of being associated with an AIDS death. And if nothing else worked, he and his wife would open their home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My wife's nursing our first child — [and] she's now a mother of seven," he remembers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"It felt like a miracle"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 1996, far from Zambia, there was an extraordinary turn of events, says Beyrer. Fifteen years after AIDS came on the scene, a very effective treatment was discovered: a combination of drugs that could suppress the virus's replication to extremely low levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results are often described in biblical terms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People who are on their deathbeds, wasting away with diarrhea and thrush and fevers, would get on these meds and, literally, rise up off their deathbeds," says Beyrer. "That's what was called the Lazarus effect — like Lazarus raised from the dead." The patients, he says, would "gain weight and go back to school and parenting and working. And it felt like a miracle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But this was a miracle only for high-income countries. Prior to PEPFAR, the treatment cost so much that it was essentially unavailable for people in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was the worst. Only when PEPFAR was established did low- and middle-income countries partake in the miracle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"In Scripture, Jesus said, 'I will not leave you as orphans,'" says Pastor Billy, recalling the passage that captured his relief when, in 2004, PEPFAR arrived in Zambia. "Despair was taken away from families."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71679" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy delivers a sermon in April to his congregants at the Somone Community Centre, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia. He remembers that at the height of the AIDS crisis in the 1990s, the funerals became so frequent that he was sometimes burying people several times a week. Even on Sunday, it would be a quick Mass and, then, to the graveyard.

   &lt;p&gt;Hillis remembers a trip to Africa, after PEPFAR was launched, where she realized that the roadside carpenters were no longer displaying caskets for sale — a brisk business when AIDS was at its height. Instead, they were lining the street with handmade beds. "Both of them you lay down in," Hillis remembers thinking to herself. But one, "you lay down to rest because you're going to get up in the morning and live a vibrant life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the drugs enabled parents to survive and give birth to children who were not infected with the virus, Pastor Billy focused more fully on the orphans who'd been left behind.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was in 2016 when he met Diana, just days after she was born. He'd been helping her mother during a rough pregnancy where she was "always sick." And he went to the hospital hoping to celebrate another child born HIV-free to an HIV-positive mother, thanks to modern medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But as Diana's first year unfolded, it became clear that she needed to be tested for HIV. She "was always suffering from diarrhea. She was weak, always underweight," recalls Pastor Billy. He was left wondering whether her mother hadn't taken her HIV medicine as consistently as necessary. He helped get Diana tested for HIV, and then, once the results confirmed his suspicion, he made sure she got on medication to suppress the virus at one of the U.S.-funded clinics in town.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana's life stabilized until two devastating family deaths. The girl's mother passed away as she neared her third birthday. Diana moved in with her grandmother — and Pastor Billy and his wife started to help more. For several years, Diana and her grandmother stayed in the pastor's house whenever they walked the 7 miles into town to access the clinic. And in 2021, when Diana's grandmother died, Diana moved in.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You see pieces of brokenness at different stages in her life," says Pastor Billy. "My heart usually bends toward brokenness."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a year, Diana grew up among his own children. She often reminded Pastor Billy of his twin sister.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, in 2022, Pastor Billy and his wife faced a difficult decision. The church asked them to move to a city four hours away. He wanted to take Diana but also felt she would benefit from staying in Kapiri Mposhi, the only place she'd really known. Plus, he had dreams of continuing his religious studies in the U.S. and knew it could be logistically challenging to formally adopt Diana so that she could travel with his family.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Pastor Billy took the new assignment — but makes a point to visit Diana in her new home regularly. Whenever he does, Diana's face lights up. In that smile, he felt a sense of hope: Diana's generation might be the last one so badly scarred by AIDS, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others felt the same. "We've been so close to truly having an AIDS-free generation of kids," says &lt;a href="https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/meet-rachel-vreeman-md-ms-director-of-the-arnhold-institute-for-global-health-at-mount-sinai/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rachel Vreeman&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Department of Global Health and Health Systems Design at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. "And that is completely at risk right now."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"There isn't enough food"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In February of this year, Diana had her first hint that something was amiss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On that 20-minute walk to school, dreams of her future stethoscope were accompanied by pangs of hunger. The monthly packages of food the U.S. had provided for Diana had stopped. And Jennifer Mukuka had lost the stipend she got for transporting medications from Diana's U.S.-funded HIV clinic to far-flung patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, there's often not enough food in the three-room house they share with Mukuka's adult daughter and two young grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71401" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Outside Jennifer Mukuka's three-room house, where Diana now lives, Mukuka prepares a lunch of pumpkin leaves and groundnuts. Sometimes, Mukuka says, the family has only enough food to cook one meal a day of beans and a maize porridge called nshima.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes we just have one meal per day," explains Mukuka. "In the evening, we just cook porridge."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In a quiet voice and speaking in Bemba, her native language, Diana says, "Because there isn't enough food, I sometimes don't feel well." HIV medication must be taken with food; otherwise it can make the person feel very unwell — one of the reasons PEPFAR usually provided food along with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's not just food that's in short supply. Her drugs are no longer readily available. Diana's U.S.-funded clinic closed so quickly after the stop-work orders came out in late January that Mukuka couldn't get Diana's medical file or a transfer letter allowing her to restart care at a Zambian government-run clinic. So Mukuka travels to nearby clinics begging for medication to last Diana until they can get the documents she needs to transfer to the government clinic — or until the U.S.-funded clinic reopens, if it does.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The State Department has issued waivers that lifesaving treatment can continue, including treatment and care for HIV. In an emailed statement, the department said that the organizations implementing lifesaving HIV programs "were notified and urged to resume approved service delivery. Agencies have been working with their implementers to resume activities as quickly as possible." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, many U.S.-funded clinics have not resumed services yet. Where Diana lives, PEPFAR funding for HIV clinics came via USAID, which has been dismantled by Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Without USAID, it has been hard for services and programs to resume even if they receive a waiver. Diana's former clinic has not reopened.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pastor Billy has lost hope that it might open its doors again. "It's closed forever," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We go to different centers, and [we're] just literally scrounging for medication. Sometimes they give us a two-week supply, sometimes a one-week supply," says Mukuka, also speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71519" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                "I stress myself [out] thinking about Diana — and me, myself, we are almost the same," says Jennifer Mukuka, who is also HIV-positive and who takes care of Diana. When she couldn't get Diana HIV medications because of the U.S. aid cuts, she shared her own medicine.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;But a handful of times, the scrounging hasn't yielded anything. That means they are sometimes entirely out of Diana's medications. Mukuka says she wakes up in the middle of the night worried about what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I stress myself [out] thinking about Diana — and me, myself, we are almost the same," says Mukuka, who is also HIV-positive. She recalls her nighttime debate about whether she should give Diana her own HIV pills that she gets from a government hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She weighs the dilemma: Diana is young with her whole life ahead of her — she needs the pills. But Diana is also reliant on her, as are her daughter and grandchildren. In the end, she settled on an answer: "Rather than letting her go without medication, I give her my medication," says Mukuka. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That worries Pastor Billy, who says: "God save Diana. That she doesn't develop symptoms because the dosage was too much or was less or it might be wrong."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even then there are crisis points — like the night of Feb. 20, when Pastor Billy learned that Diana was entirely out of medicine. Eventually that night, he found a man one town over from Diana who could help. "He said, 'We can share for five days,'" recalls Pastor Billy, who quickly went to his church to solicit donations for the money needed to transport the medications in a shared taxi from the nearby town to Diana's town.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana has, at times, gone a week or two without her medication, Mukuka admits. She knows that when people skip their daily HIV medications, the virus can become drug resistant. "When I couldn't get medication for Diana, I was extremely stressed," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pastor Billy and Mukuka have spent months trying to get Diana's file from the clinic so she can register at the closest government hospital. The Zambian Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment about why its medical facilities require past medical files, given the situation. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As they navigate the process, Diana has been taking whatever supply they can get. "Two weeks, one week, two weeks, sometimes even days," says Pastor Billy. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But this past week, he says, he breathed a sigh of relief when he got a phone call announcing that she had been able to get a month's supply of her medication from the district hospital. "She's now getting the medicine, but the consistency is [still] not there," he says, noting that she used to get a six-month supply.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he feels surrounded by warnings about what might happen. At his church, others are falling ill without their HIV medications. And he has sent Hillis a message about how he's starting to notice that carpenters are displaying caskets again on the roadside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Kids will go hungry"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration has, in the days and weeks following the inaugural proclamations about frozen aid, made a commitment to providing lifesaving treatment like Diana's drugs, the prospect of other support for AIDS orphans — food, clothing, bedding, school fees, counseling — is less promising.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Kids will go hungry. Kids will drop out of school. Kids will be subjected to transactional sex to be able to survive. This is exactly what will happen," says the U.S. civil servant who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. "It's just absolutely atrocious, in my opinion, that we're now bringing back, potentially, another generation of HIV-positive young people, which could have been totally avoided."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Goosby, who used to run PEPFAR, is adamant that the entirety of the program for orphans and vulnerable children should be allowed as part of the waiver for lifesaving aid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What could be more lifesaving than taking a child, feeding them and educating them?" he says, arguing that interventions that aren't a pill can still be lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It really, truly does feel that we are going backward," adds Beyrer of Duke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71685" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy and Diana share a close bond. When Pastor Billy visits Diana, she lights up with a smile. Here, they share a laugh before she walks to school.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For Diana and Mukuka, their hope is pinned to small snacks and thin plastic baggies — some filled with about a quarter cup of flour, others with a similar amount of sugar. They use whatever money Pastor Billy can spare to buy the supplies and sell them to neighbors. Each goes for under 20 cents. They hope it will add up to enough money for food and the basics for school — books, notebooks and a uniform. But Mukuka must also feed her daughter and grandchildren — and pay rent.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a Wednesday in April, Pastor Billy got up early to make the hourslong drive to check on Diana. He caught her before she set off on her walk to school. She lit up, as usual, when she saw him. She calls him "father." They took pictures together, making goofy faces.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then it was time for her to head to school — and for Pastor Billy to drive back home, wondering what to do next. These months of uncertainty, along with the frantic searches for medicine and food, have highlighted the vulnerability of the systems he used to depend on — and also Diana's vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He got into the car thinking that his plans to study religion in the U.S. might need to take a back seat to Diana's needs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Love is not somebody who visits and takes a picture and puts it on the fridge," he says. Perhaps, he thinks,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he and his wife should stay in Zambia — and adopt Diana.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71248" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

Make your bed a tech-free zone &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It might feel cozy to scroll or stream in bed, but Dr. Walker says it's one of the worst things you can do for your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blue light emitted from screens can interfere with the natural sleep-wake cycle, making it &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14722587/Thousands-insomnia-sufferers-missing-groundbreaking-treatment-simply-doctors-dont-know-exist.html"&gt;harder to fall asleep &lt;/a&gt;and affecting the quality of your snooze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This light disrupts your body's production of melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Quizzed on how much sleep people should get, sleep expert Dr. Matthew Walker (pictured) recommends 7 to 9 hours per night&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not just about light. When you use technology under the covers, your bed mentally becomes a place of stimulation rather than relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Walker recently helped design the ultimate bedroom for a peaceful night of sleep, which can be found at the Equinox Hotel in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So concerned about the harms caused by light pollution, he even removed tiny blue lights from the smoke detectors for a complete blackout experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;2. Stick to a schedule, even on weekends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the last thing you want to do after a long week, but waking up on weekends at the same time you would for work is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you tend to sleep in on weekends and pull late nights during the week, Dr. Walker says you're throwing your internal clock out of sync. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regimented slumber helps regulate your circadian rhythm so your body knows when to wind down and when to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your goal: Hit the same bedtime and wake-up time every day. Not only will you fall asleep faster, but you'll wake up feeling more refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;3. Avoid caffeine after lunch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine lingers in your system long after that pick-me-up - up to 10 hours - so that means you shouldn't even be indulging in that 3 p.m. latte, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that it slashed sleep time by 45 minutes, which, Dr. Walker says over time raises the risk of almost every major chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why his golden rule is to cut caffeine early. 'The earlier you can limit your intake, the less impact it will have,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A good rule of thumb is to cut caffeine intake after noon, which means by 10 p.m., it should have fully cleared from your system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also in the no-go zone is alcohol before bed. While a glass of wine might make you drowsy, Dr. Walker says it 'certainly shouldn't be used as a sedative.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, regular boozing before bed can make sleep more fragmented and increase the risk of long-term insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;4. Practice a wind-down ritual before bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forget doomscrolling or racing through chores until the minute you pass out. Dr. Walker recommends building in a calm, tech-free hour to cue your body for rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Try 'relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the hotel rooms he developed, there are meditation and breath-work programs installed on the TVs, which he says have 'an immediate calming effect'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Screens are OK in this case if you're just using them to zen out, he explains. And he recommends practicing these relaxation techniques an hour or more before bed, so that you can then ditch your devices and truly switch off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also recommends a light-dimming routine to mimic the gradual effects of sunset and sunrise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is another design feature he has incorporated into the Equinox hotel rooms, with an automated lighting system designed to put guests to bed and wake them gently in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'In the last hour before bed, set an alarm and turn down half of the lights in your home for two weeks,' he said, recommending a trial period. 'Then go back to full lights on, and ask yourself which you prefer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'If possible, use dimmer switches or lower-wattage lamps for evening lighting.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;5. Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California , told the Daily Mail that some of the biggest factors behind peoples' inability to sleep include 'chronic stress, irregular schedules and the rise of tech gadgets'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of the aforementioned hacks matter if you're simply not sleeping enough, says Dr. Walker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The magic range is between '7 to 9 hours per night, as supported by robust evidence showing that this range provides maximum benefits for brain health, emotional stability, immune function and physical repair,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Less than six hours? That's when things get dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor says a lack of sleep is 'directly linked to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction and impaired cognitive performance.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not to mention, it raises stress hormone levels, lowers immunity and can even increase the risk of early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insomnia isn't just annoying, it's costly. Sleep disorders rack up an estimated $94.9 billion each year in the US, from doctor visits and prescriptions to lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to Dr. Walker, it doesn't have to be that way - yes, you can get yourself to a place where you can skip the melatonin gummies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Start by reclaiming your bed as a place for only sleep (and sex), and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr. Walker has designed the Sleep Experience program at the Equinox Hotel New York.

It’s in gummies, capsules, powders, and teas—promising everything from stress relief and better sleep to more energy and even extra strength at the gym. People love it. It’s been around for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine, so most folks figure it’s safe. And for the most part, it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the plot twist no one saw coming: more and more reports are linking ashwagandha to liver problems—some of them pretty serious, and in rare cases, even fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What? Liver damage from Ashwagandha?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it sounds wild, but there’s growing evidence. According to LiverTox (a database run by the NIH), there have been real, documented cases of liver injury linked to ashwagandha. Most people didn’t notice anything until about 2 to 12 weeks after they started taking it. Then—bam—symptoms like yellowing of the skin (jaundice), dark pee, and intense itching showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10531359/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;out of India between 2019 and 2022 reported 23 people who developed liver issues after taking just ashwagandha—nothing else. Eight of those were using single-ingredient products. Most of them got better once they stopped taking it, but sadly, three people with pre-existing liver problems died from acute-on-chronic liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what’s going on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts aren’t 100% sure why ashwagandha affects the liver in some people, but the current theory points to certain compounds in the herb called withanolides—especially one called withanone. In high doses or over long periods, these may mess with the liver’s detox system, particularly the glutathione system. Basically, it’s like overloading your liver’s cleanup crew until they can't keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver damage tied to ashwagandha isn’t only happening in one place. Reports from Iceland, the U.S., and Europe have all confirmed cases. Some were serious enough to require hospitalization—and at least one person needed a liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;European health agencies have flagged at least 22 severe liver injury cases, and that’s likely just scratching the surface. To put it in perspective, herb-related liver damage makes up about 20% of all liver injuries caused by drugs and supplements, and yep—ashwagandha is on that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is liver toxicity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the deal with liver toxicity—it’s basically your liver waving a red flag and saying, “Hey! I’m overwhelmed here!” Your liver is like your body’s detox center. It filters out all the junk—alcohol, meds, processed food chemicals, pollution, even herbal supplements sometimes. But when you overload it with too much of anything, it starts to struggle, and that’s what we call liver toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn’t mean your liver fails overnight. Liver toxicity can build up slowly and quietly. Some common signs? You might feel super tired all the time, have yellowing skin or eyes (that’s jaundice), stomach pain, dark pee, itchy skin, or even lose your appetite. Sometimes, it’s so sneaky that people don’t notice until something serious shows up in a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What causes it? Well, heavy alcohol use is a classic culprit. But guess what—some over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen (paracetamol) can also mess with your liver if taken in high doses. Even “natural” stuff like ashwagandha, kava, or green tea extract in supplement form can trigger toxicity in some people. Your liver doesn’t care if it came from a pharmacy or a plant—if it’s too much, it’s too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? The liver is a tough organ and can often heal itself if you catch the problem early. Cut down on booze, ditch unnecessary supplements, eat clean, and drink plenty of water. And if you feel “off” for too long, don’t guess—get a liver function test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should You Freak Out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. Millions of people use ashwagandha regularly and never have a problem. Critics of the scare point out that, with over a million U.S. users as of 2020, 23 reported cases is still a pretty tiny risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s a good reminder that "natural" doesn’t always mean "harmless." Like anything else you put in your body, moderation and awareness are key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here’s What You Can Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using ashwagandha—or thinking about trying it—here’s your game plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your dose reasonable. Most studies use between 150 mg to 600 mg per day. Don’t go overboard just because you think “more = better.” That’s not how herbs work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip it if you have liver problems. If you’ve had any kind of liver issue in the past, it’s probably best to steer clear, at least until you talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t mix it with everything under the sun. Taking ashwagandha along with other supplements or medications—especially those that affect the liver—can increase the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to your body. If you start noticing signs like yellow skin, nausea, dark urine, or weird fatigue, stop taking it and check in with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider getting liver tests. If you’ve been using it long-term or at high doses, it might be worth getting some basic blood work done just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha’s got a lot of reputation for it—lowering stress, improving sleep, boosting mood. But it’s not a magic pill, and recent liver injury cases are a solid reminder that even the most hyped “natural” supplements can come with side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to swear off ashwagandha forever. Just be smart about how you use it. Stick to recommended doses, avoid mixing it with other liver-impacting substances, and stay alert to how your body reacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respect the herb. Use it wisely. And don’t fall into the trap of thinking “herbal” automatically means “risk-free.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 05:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_gFBVV95cUxOQWYyTTVrMTBPU0NWdmJ6SFRQbWFfTXZsWnRxSGtmOVVPbjZaTFo5d1ljUjBETl91RHNYTXNXc1NvVjhlOXlpOXBnc19oUGlEdXFIZWJocnZ3aWxBY3l3Sk1BRk9NWDBJM1VSdHhXRHdLaC13akR6TGJzWFljNHdtSHBrYXltU21nWE9XSjBNLXBGTHdJMkZXVE0tZGxtem5WNWFiWU9RSEtnS0Jqb3dmSkVCaFZ1Z2w4RnB4azJ4LW1Va1BXRGxiejUxX2ZHdVQ3bF81RFllMkZoRzhnbUF6WGZhZDZOei16WWlOUHRmaS1ISC1KU05UQXhLNXI2UQ</guid></item><item><title>人工智能“副驾驶”以加快利兹医院的癌症诊断- BBC | AI 'co-pilot' to speed up cancer diagnoses at Leeds hospitals - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1NaUpneGhodENrZFNfaUFwQzN0Z0s1eXJoaEY5b2MxUnZZZEF2bzhYRkljX2pIWUltQTZHVkw1MHhQb2NWbjIwNHNoSzRTMEZDRFBxNm9NUjlyZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1yVDhNT0NWY3BwdEdna3JjV3NQNF81Rmp4czBzVDdDMGpaOFc3MndkUld3RVh5dk81dUkzSHNuMUVGVUY3TDh5UWxWb2FZeU9VVndmX2tqYWx1eUVEcExN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;AI 'co-pilot' used to speed up cancer diagnosis &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Emily Doughty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Yorkshire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust Two men are looking at a screen on the left.

That diagnosis belongs to other families, I thought. Not ours.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Fischers met with renowned neurologists and prepared the then-61-year-old to participate in an Alzheimer’s clinical trial for the drug varoglutamstat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came devastating news that meant Mrs Fischer wouldn't be eligible for the trial - she was suffering from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-2242332/Cerebrospinal-fluid-leak-Woman-dies-brain-fluid-leak-months-Arizona.html"&gt;a persistent leak of spinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in her spinal system, but doctors couldn't pinpoint the source - and couldn't fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believed it was likely a result of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-9266007/New-mum-lie-flat-stop-excruciating-headaches-C-section-caused-brain-leak.html"&gt;epidurals she'd received during childbirth&lt;/a&gt; - an injection in the back that numbs a person from their belly button to their thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a common pain relief option during childbirth and an estimated 61 percent of women who give birth receive an epidural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After suffering for more than a decade, doctors said a new procedure would allos them to inject &lt;span&gt;dye into Mrs Fischer's spinal fluid to search for the leak - a small spot in the middle of her back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks after they sealed it, all of her symptoms went away and doctors said she didn't actually have Alzheimer's - &lt;/span&gt;the tiny spot in her back was actually the source of all her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer's mother, 61, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after years of worsening memory, severe migraines, balance problems, and nausea. But they had no idea the source of her problems was a fixable spinal fluid leak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Fischer's &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;health battle began&lt;/a&gt; long before her Alzheimer's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It started in spring 2001, when Sean said he received a call from his dad: Mom had pulled over on the highway, vomiting from a sudden, crushing headache. Her doctor called it a migraine, but months later she lost hearing in one ear and was diagnosed with Ménière’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adjusted — avoiding movements that triggered vertigo, wearing a hearing aid in her forties, and taking daily meds for the headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even as she quietly suffered, Sean &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis?utm_source=x&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid-social_&amp;amp;utm_campaign=marketing_evergreen&amp;amp;utm_adgroup=ret&amp;amp;utm_content=alzheimers&amp;amp;utm_adid=1924872245341823240&amp;amp;twclid=275q9y2oonhono4qjy71vk3yuu"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;for The Free Press, she stayed steady for him and his brothers, never missing a soccer game, school musical, or packed lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, neurologists at Columbia University diagnosed her with a Chiari malformation, a structural defect where the brain is pushed through the opening at the base of the skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suspected the malformation was caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak, sparked by her three epidurals from the births of each of her sons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epidurals are extremely safe and are administered by inserting a needle in the space of the lower spine just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It delivers anesthetic medication, which numbs the lower half of the body and blocks pain while allowing the patient to stay awake and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it can occasionally result in a leak if the needle punctures the thin, tough membrane surrounding the spinal cord containing the CSF, called the dura mater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An epidural is a safe, widely used method of pain relief during childbirth, delivered by inserting a needle into the epidural space in the lower spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this happens, some of the fluid that cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord can leak out into surrounding tissues. It can only be patched up surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leak had, over the years, led to a loss in cerebrospinal fluid volume, causing her brain to sink. This can lead to severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, hearing changes, memory problems, and double vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started high school in 2015, and around that time, I began to notice the quiet dislocation of my mom’s mind,’ Sean wrote for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;The Free Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer wrote about his mother's misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's that was really a constellation of symptoms linked to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When we cooked dinner together, she would have trouble following recipes. She’d stare at her calendar for long stretches of time; making sense of it seemed to require more effort than usual. She started to repeat herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By the time I left for college in Rhode Island, the phrase “You already asked me that” had become a common refrain in the house I grew up in, but at first, we blamed her, telling her she needed to pay more attention.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seeing doctors for headaches, hearing, and anxiety, none of whom believed there could be a common origin. Her memory problems were worsening as well, which led to Mr and Mrs Fischer to to turn to NYU Langone Health’s Center for Cognitive Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My mom was tested extensively — and two months later came the diagnosis, with the finality of a punctuation mark. Alzheimer’s. When it hit her that there was no cure, my mom was bedridden for three days,’ Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hope came with the study. But then doctors called the Fischers and informed them that the CSF leak would not allow her to participate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despair took over.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a few weeks later, Mrs Fischer’s doctor called to tell them about recent medical innovations that would allow surgeons to find and fix the leak, allowing her to participate in the drug trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months later, doctors inserted a probe through the femoral artery in Mrs Fischer’s leg, fed it upward toward her spinal system, and sealed the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘Two weeks later, I visited home, and found Mom more alert than she had been in years. There was no absent look in her eyes.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six weeks, her problems with memory were gone entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And eventually, Mom’s neurologist confirmed: She did not have Alzheimer’s.

She would ask the same question multiple times, be bedbound from migraines and unstable on her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mystery behind her decades-long ailments was seemingly solved when she was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-d8d8b240-47b8-11f0-a1bc-256a2104db0b"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease in June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘We had spent countless hours fretting over what could be wrong, but not once did I think it could be early-onset Alzheimer’s. That diagnosis belongs to other families, I thought. Not ours.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Fischers met with renowned neurologists and prepared the then-61-year-old to participate in an Alzheimer’s clinical trial for the drug varoglutamstat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came devastating news that meant Mrs Fischer wouldn't be eligible for the trial - she was suffering from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-2242332/Cerebrospinal-fluid-leak-Woman-dies-brain-fluid-leak-months-Arizona.html"&gt;a persistent leak of spinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in her spinal system, but doctors couldn't pinpoint the source - and couldn't fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believed it was likely a result of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-9266007/New-mum-lie-flat-stop-excruciating-headaches-C-section-caused-brain-leak.html"&gt;epidurals she'd received during childbirth&lt;/a&gt; - an injection in the back that numbs a person from their belly button to their thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a common pain relief option during childbirth and an estimated 61 percent of women who give birth receive an epidural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After suffering for more than a decade, doctors said a new procedure would allos them to inject &lt;span&gt;dye into Mrs Fischer's spinal fluid to search for the leak - a small spot in the middle of her back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks after they sealed it, all of her symptoms went away and doctors said she didn't actually have Alzheimer's - &lt;/span&gt;the tiny spot in her back was actually the source of all her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer's mother, 61, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after years of worsening memory, severe migraines, balance problems, and nausea. But they had no idea the source of her problems was a fixable spinal fluid leak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Fischer's &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;health battle began&lt;/a&gt; long before her Alzheimer's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It started in spring 2001, when Sean said he received a call from his dad: Mom had pulled over on the highway, vomiting from a sudden, crushing headache. Her doctor called it a migraine, but months later she lost hearing in one ear and was diagnosed with Ménière’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adjusted — avoiding movements that triggered vertigo, wearing a hearing aid in her forties, and taking daily meds for the headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even as she quietly suffered, Sean &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis?utm_source=x&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid-social_&amp;amp;utm_campaign=marketing_evergreen&amp;amp;utm_adgroup=ret&amp;amp;utm_content=alzheimers&amp;amp;utm_adid=1924872245341823240&amp;amp;twclid=275q9y2oonhono4qjy71vk3yuu"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;for The Free Press, she stayed steady for him and his brothers, never missing a soccer game, school musical, or packed lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, neurologists at Columbia University diagnosed her with a Chiari malformation, a structural defect where the brain is pushed through the opening at the base of the skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suspected the malformation was caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak, sparked by her three epidurals from the births of each of her sons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epidurals are extremely safe and are administered by inserting a needle in the space of the lower spine just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It delivers anesthetic medication, which numbs the lower half of the body and blocks pain while allowing the patient to stay awake and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it can occasionally result in a leak if the needle punctures the thin, tough membrane surrounding the spinal cord containing the CSF, called the dura mater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An epidural is a safe, widely used method of pain relief during childbirth, delivered by inserting a needle into the epidural space in the lower spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this happens, some of the fluid that cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord can leak out into surrounding tissues. It can only be patched up surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leak had, over the years, led to a loss in cerebrospinal fluid volume, causing her brain to sink. This can lead to severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, hearing changes, memory problems, and double vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started high school in 2015, and around that time, I began to notice the quiet dislocation of my mom’s mind,’ Sean wrote for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;The Free Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer wrote about his mother's misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's that was really a constellation of symptoms linked to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When we cooked dinner together, she would have trouble following recipes. She’d stare at her calendar for long stretches of time; making sense of it seemed to require more effort than usual. She started to repeat herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By the time I left for college in Rhode Island, the phrase “You already asked me that” had become a common refrain in the house I grew up in, but at first, we blamed her, telling her she needed to pay more attention.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seeing doctors for headaches, hearing, and anxiety, none of whom believed there could be a common origin. Her memory problems were worsening as well, which led to Mr and Mrs Fischer to to turn to NYU Langone Health’s Center for Cognitive Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My mom was tested extensively — and two months later came the diagnosis, with the finality of a punctuation mark. Alzheimer’s. When it hit her that there was no cure, my mom was bedridden for three days,’ Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hope came with the study. But then doctors called the Fischers and informed them that the CSF leak would not allow her to participate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despair took over.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a few weeks later, Mrs Fischer’s doctor called to tell them about recent medical innovations that would allow surgeons to find and fix the leak, allowing her to participate in the drug trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months later, doctors inserted a probe through the femoral artery in Mrs Fischer’s leg, fed it upward toward her spinal system, and sealed the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘Two weeks later, I visited home, and found Mom more alert than she had been in years.

&lt;p&gt;When back pain strikes it can be debilitating and most of us will try anything to make it feel better. After a recent bout of horrible lower-back pain (thanks to some overzealous weeding) I found &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/fitness-equipment-tech/i-tried-using-a-massage-gun-for-30-days-and-its-now-an-essential-part-of-my-muscle-recovery" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/fitness-equipment-tech/i-tried-using-a-massage-gun-for-30-days-and-its-now-an-essential-part-of-my-muscle-recovery"&gt;using a massage gun&lt;/a&gt; provided some relief—but I know that to stop this happening again I need to strengthen my back and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was surprised to see a PT on Instagram demonstrate how a glute bridge variation could “save” your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Reel, Alisa from the account Movement By Alisa, can be seen performing a glute bridge with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fyoga-block%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3422271%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-9642923965257928138-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/yoga-block/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=3422271" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fyoga-block%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3422271%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;yoga block&lt;/a&gt; between her knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like anyone with a bad back, I was hopeful this move could make a big difference, but I decided to double check with an expert first, and spoke to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://relentless-spirit.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://relentless-spirit.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Baltazar Villanueva&lt;/a&gt;, NASM-certified personal trainer with experience in corrective exercise and core stabilization work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news—Villanueva agrees this move can play a part in building the strength needed to support your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Squeezing a ball between the knees activates the adductors (inner thighs), which are often underused,” says Villanueva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The adductors and pelvic floor work closely with the deep core muscles so by engaging them, you get more stability through the pelvis and lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-9fTCHV48p5y3G29NobhzmU" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-9fTCHV48p5y3G29NobhzmU slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This added stability can reduce compensations in the low back during the movement and help retrain the body to fire the glutes more effectively—both key for reducing strain and pain in the lumbar spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how should you add this movement to your week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I typically recommend two or three sets of 10–15 repetitions,” says Villanueva. “focusing on slow, controlled movement and a strong glute squeeze at the top. Quality over quantity is key here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exhale as you lift into the bridge to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;engage the core&lt;/a&gt; and avoid overarching the back. This is a small move with big impact—but it works best when paired with lifestyle habits like regular movement, hydration and minimizing long periods of sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, two to three times per week is a great starting point for exercise, especially if they’re dealing with low back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to spend some time working on your core strength. “Think of the core as a brace for your spine,” says Villanueva. “When your core is strong—and that includes deep stabilizing muscles like the transverse abdominis—it reduces the load and movement demands on the spine itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This support helps prevent poor posture and protects against the kind of repetitive stress that often leads to chronic back pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is with these three &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/all-you-need-is-your-bodyweight-and-these-three-physical-therapist-approved-exercises-to-strengthen-an-injury-prone-lower-back" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/all-you-need-is-your-bodyweight-and-these-three-physical-therapist-approved-exercises-to-strengthen-an-injury-prone-lower-back"&gt;bodyweight core exercises&lt;/a&gt; recommended by a physical therapist.&lt;/p&gt;
