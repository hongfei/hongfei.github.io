  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmhsw00223575li0yds6t@published"&gt;My wife, “Lanna,” and I are in a dispute over what should be a normal childhood milestone for our daughter, “Tillie.” Tillie is now 8 and has never had a bicycle. I first suggested getting her one when she turned 4, but Lanna was vehemently opposed to the idea because she was convinced that our daughter would injure herself. Tillie is an active child with no disabilities that would impair her ability to ride a bike. Each year I have brought this up with my wife, but there’s always a reason she vetoes it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmhwt00263575fgl08xyz@published"&gt;When I suggested getting Tillie a bike last Christmas, Lanna refused, claiming Tillie would “take off somewhere and get run over or kidnapped.” Tillie is growing increasingly upset over not having a bike of her own and being able to ride with her friends (who have been riding since before kindergarten) and has had numerous fights with her mother over this. When I asked Lanna what age she would be comfortable with allowing our daughter to have a bike, her reply was “maybe 13 or 14.” I think this is completely unreasonable, but she refuses to budge. I am concerned that Tillie will not only miss out on a central part of childhood, but also that her relationship with her mother will be damaged. What can I do to get my wife to see how out of line her position is?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmi3g002a3575u0ljyuhc@published"&gt;I have never known a kid who learned to ride a bicycle without at least a few scrapes and falls. And I suppose I am a bit sympathetic, since I am a giant baby who can’t stand the sight of blood. Your wife’s fear that Tillie might injure herself—like many of the worries and anxieties we have for our kids—is not necessarily unreasonable, in and of itself. But that doesn’t mean that Lanna can reasonably base all parenting decisions on that fear, or Tillie would never get to do or experience anything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="149" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmi5k002b35754vlj7e8x@published"&gt;When talking with Lanna, I wouldn’t focus on the fact that you think she’s wrong or being ridiculous or harming her relationship with Tillie. I would instead try to talk in positive terms about what you both want for Tillie. Presumably, you want her to be brave, confident, and independent enough to try new things. You want to shield her from unnecessary danger without limiting her opportunities to learn and explore. You want to raise her in a supportive environment and let her know that you believe in her. You want her to be able to figure out hard things and learn how to solve problems (and know that she can!), develop resilience, and ultimately grow up to trust in herself and her ability. You don’t want her to always worry that she won’t be able to do something, or refrain from trying because she thinks she might fail.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmiag002c3575vtcjdefl@published"&gt;I’m guessing that if Lanna is this worried about a very typical kid thing like riding a bike, it’s probably not the only way her anxiety over Tillie manifests. If she does have rather excessive anxiety as a parent and it’s interfering with the opportunities Tillie has to learn and have fun, then I think it’s important for Lanna to try to recognize what’s going on, acknowledge the impact on Tillie, and perhaps seek whatever support may be necessary to help her manage that anxiety. Again, it’s so natural to be worried about our kids; to not want to see them threatened or hurt—that’s always going to be the case! But we shouldn’t let our understandable worries and anxieties interfere with their daily lives, make them question their own abilities, or prevent them from doing the normal, fun things they really want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="160" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmigh002f3575daishwhq@published"&gt;I am a cis woman in my early 30s who has known for a while that I am not interested in having biological children (and I’m not that interested in having non-biological children, either). I have a partner, and he is in agreement with me on this. The issue is my parents. They want me to have kids, and while they are kind of trying to be respectful about my decision, it’s clear they think that I’m too young to have decided, that I might change my mind, or that I’m just saying it to be dramatic. Compounding this is the fact that I’ve had some pretty serious medical issues that would make having a kid difficult, if not traumatic; when I’ve brought this up as a point in favor of not reproducing, I have been met with dismissal over my legitimate fears (pain and potentially life-threatening complications) to the tune of “but you’d have a baby at the end.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="120" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmiii002g3575lbwjrol8@published"&gt;I worry that I wouldn’t have their support if I had to pursue medical interventions for my health issues that would prevent me from having kids, but when I have brought this up as a possibility, they have also dismissed it. For the record, I like kids, and my younger sister has always wanted kids and will probably have them in the next few years, so I am not depriving my parents of grandchildren. I often find myself arguing with them in my head, trying to get them to support my decision. How do I handle these frustrating feelings I have toward my (very lovely!) parents when it feels like they don’t respect this major life decision I have made?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmirw002j3575um6luo00@published"&gt;It sucks when you don’t get all the support or understanding you want—and deserve—from the people closest to you. I understand why you feel frustrated, disappointed, and kind of judged. You asked what to do about those feelings, and I think it’s important to acknowledge them. It’s okay to be upset or annoyed; to wish that your parents understood and accepted where you’re coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

Ultimately, you don’t need your parents’ approval or even their acceptance in this, and I hope they can eventually grasp the fact that your reproductive decisions have nothing to do with them. It’s up to you and only you to make the choices you feel are best for your health and wellbeing. If you’re sure about what’s right for you, that’s what matters most—try to let that be all the affirmation you need.&lt;/p&gt;

Alicia has never really bonded with her sister, and when I asked her about what she wanted to do for her birthday party, she said she wants to have one without her sister being there.&lt;br&gt;When I tried to explain to her how sad that would be for Mariana and asked her to imagine how she would feel if Mariana wanted to leave her out, she said she wouldn’t care. She has been very persistent in her desire not to have Mariana at her party, so much so that she has even told us we could make it her “present.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmj5b002o35757oh6kmrr@published"&gt;Now my husband is actually starting to think that she shouldn’t have to include Mariana if she doesn’t want to “because it’s her birthday,” and has suggested we leave her at home with a sitter. Mariana is old enough to understand being excluded and I won’t agree to something so hurtful. This is becoming so much of an issue I am considering not having a party for Alicia at all. How can I resolve this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="145" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmjen002r35758bpae36o@published"&gt;If it weren’t for the way Alicia seems so determined to leave her little sister out, I wouldn’t make a huge deal out of the party itself. I think it’s pretty common for families to hold a family birthday celebration as well as a separate party for a kid’s friends? Plus, a 3-year age gap means there won’t always be a natural overlap when it comes to friend groups or interests. My kids have had birthday friend-parties their sibling didn’t attend, not because they flat-out weren’t welcome but because they just might not have been super interested in or ready for whatever the party activity happened to be. My older child is 17, so for years now she’s often had some sort of birthday hangout with her friends and no one else; that doesn’t mean she doesn’t love her little sister or want her around.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9vkmjhj002s3575o7vr8y0v@published"&gt;What you’re talking about sounds like something else, though, since you say that Alicia has never really bonded with Mariana. I understand why you might want to tell Alicia that if she has a party, Mariana has to at least have the option of tagging along, partly to establish the basic expectation of kindness and inclusion in your family. If that’s the decision, you and your husband can in turn make sure that Mariana is entertained and not disrupting Alicia’s fun with her friends (perhaps inviting one friend of Mariana’s to keep her company, if you think that would help?).&lt;/p&gt;

I understand why you’d find that upsetting or sad. But it won’t necessarily be like this forever. Sibling relationships change all the time. Separate from the birthday party conversation, try to talk with Alicia about her feelings about her little sister, do your best to listen and understand what those feelings are based on. You need to know what she’s thinking and feeling—and why—if you want to help her think about her sister differently and express her feelings in less hurtful ways.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. vowing to reexamine the childhood vaccination schedule, measles and other previously eliminated infectious diseases could become more common. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833361"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; published today by epidemiologists at Stanford University attempts to quantify those impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Using a computer model, the authors found that with current state-level vaccination rates, measles could reestablish itself and become consistently present in the United States in the next two decades. Their model predicted this outcome in 83 percent of simulations. If current vaccination rates stay the same, the model estimated that the US could see more than 850,000 cases, 170,000 hospitalizations, and 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. The results appear in the Journal of the American Medical Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“I don’t see this as speculative. It is a modeling exercise, but it’s based on good numbers,” says Jeffrey Griffiths, professor of public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “The big point is that measles is very likely to become endemic quickly if we continue in this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The United States declared measles eliminated in 2000 after decades of successful vaccination campaigns. Elimination means there has been no chain of disease transmission inside a country lasting longer than 12 months. The current measles outbreak in Texas, however, could put that status at risk. With more than 600 cases, 64 hospitalizations, and two deaths, it’s the largest outbreak the state has seen since 1992, when 990 cases were linked to a single outbreak. Nationally, the US has seen &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;800 cases of measles so far in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the most since 2019. Last year, there were 285 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We’re really at a point where we should be trying to increase vaccination as much as possible,” says Mathew Kiang, assistant professor of epidemiology and population health at Stanford University and one of the authors of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Childhood vaccination in the US has been on a downward trend. Data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from state and local vaccination programs found that from the 2019–2020 school year to the 2022–2023 school year, coverage among kindergartners with state-required vaccinations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;declined from 95 percent to approximately 93 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Those vaccines included MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella), DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), polio, and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the current study, Kiang and his colleagues modeled each state separately, taking into account their vaccination rates, which ranged from 88 percent to 96 percent for measles, 78 percent to 91 percent for diphtheria, and 90 percent to 97 percent for the polio vaccine. Other variables included demographics of the population, vaccine efficacy, risk of disease importation, typical duration of the infection, the time between exposure and being able to spread the disease, and the contagiousness of the disease, also known as the basic reproduction number. Measles is highly contagious, with one person on average being able to infect 12 to 18 people. The researchers used 12 as the basic reproduction number in their study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 16:55:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPZWxEVExubzVqYVVjWlJDd3pUQm9aSXhQbzNqVGJIeGNqVTdWTWkxZkxENllGamxZTnRfYkJETU1iZ3VVWVlVc0tkLVl1NW82dFA5T1FYY0NHdnpjSE03UGZLeWN5QUd5dWJSSmR0QUZONFpSdGVMQVVIY0tXNzFKQTBYZkRjYnFrTGNYSnQyaDZEN2pLWmZnODZIY0tYZHZ3aXNtT2VWVTA3ekU</guid></item><item><title>“今天的年轻人会发现这个深层次的问题” ：孩子们曾经做过的19件事，你现在永远不会做- buzzfeed.com | "Young People Today Would Find This Deeply Problematic": 19 Things Kids Used To Do That You'd Never Do Now - buzzfeed.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxQbzdZR3ZvR1hCV1RoTkdKSHdFZFhoNEoyQU9Mbkp5S19PWm5FRFFQNlRnQWVKRm1OYnlQMVpDTWhtQ0ZHczd2al82dVRxMV9Jc2JlSDMzeUctQ01YYUdoQlBHT2g2TjN5X20tYUJIYnZiOE40bVVmZVdqVWZCRktIVzJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Montana last week reported its first measles cases in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YRT7YUMZZGMRAZDUCQAGRJOKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The majority of the infections have been reported in a West Texas outbreak that has led to the deaths of two children.

More than half the adults surveyed expressed uncertainty about whether to believe false assertions, such as that the measles vaccine is more dangerous than the disease — claims that Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" target="_blank"&gt;amplified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P6KCD4F7INF7XCTB4RYS2HDPIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the decade before a measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, an estimated 3 million to 4 million people in the U.S. were infected each year, 400 to 500 people died, 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 suffered swelling of the brain, or encephalitis, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2UYIN6WCNBTJBEB2T7SM2HFRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But in 2000 the U.S. was finally able to declare measles “eliminated,” a term that means no continuous spread for more than a year. Cases and outbreaks still occur because of international travel, typically with an under-immunized U.S. traveler returning from a country where measles is endemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NFMUQLCK5FAXLEGRM2WA5LWWXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For the new research, scientists used state vaccination, birth and death rates to find their results. They estimated current vaccination coverage for measles at 87.7 percent to 95.6 percent. To prevent measles outbreaks, 95 percent of a community must &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/24/measles-vaccine-booster-outbreak-states/" target="_blank"&gt;receive two doses &lt;/a&gt;of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSBU6TKCPVC7HOAF3MFC5ZHOFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Based on what scientists know about the epidemiology of measles, one of the most contagious diseases on Earth, they forecast how it would spread from one community to another and how quickly it could spread regularly at increased rates throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X4MBV7OM3ZF43FB6Y73WVTXXTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study did not take into account the difference in vaccination rates within a state, the authors said. Nor did it account for changes in immunization rates when infections increased because of an outbreak, which occurred during the covid pandemic, Basit said. But even the most conservative estimates underscore the severe consequences if measles reestablishes itself in the U.S., the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7ESTN53RNNBKBLPV57PFPJWSVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Measles outbreaks are surging globally, with Romania last year reporting the largest number of cases among 53 countries in Europe and Central Asia, according to the World Health Organization. Romania, with a population of about 19 million, had more than 30,000 cases in 2024, followed by Kazakhstan with about 28,000 cases. Romania’s recent measles surge is linked to declining vaccination rates, vaccine hesitancy, and disruptions in the health system during the pandemic, health experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KPCROIYM2NGITD7Q5QSHLOVDCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the U.S., public health and infectious-disease experts have been talking for months about ways to combat false claims and misinformation about vaccines. On Thursday, an infectious-disease research center at the University of Minnesota announced an initiative to provide a coordinated response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HCDLTDV55ZAOVDOBVQ6RNBCRRA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“People who care about preventing needless suffering and death from vaccine-preventable diseases have watched the current measles outbreak and Health Secretary Robert F.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Kennedy Jr.’s rhetoric about vaccines with rising alarm,” said Michael&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Osterholm, director of the university’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which launched the Vaccine Integrity Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7MASA4B3IZC7FJTVSHA3QRY224" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Initial funding for the project is from a foundation established by Christy Walton, an heir to the Walmart fortune, Osterholm said.

              &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever had your mind blank out while in the middle of something, you’re far from alone. In research published this week, scientists are making the case that mind blanking is a genuine brain phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Belgium, France, and Australia conducted the study, a review of the existing data on mind blanking. They argue that blanking out should be seen and studied as its own state of consciousness, similar to but separate from things like having your mind wander.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors are all experts in consciousness research, and they were inspired to collaborate following a related &lt;a href="https://theassc.org/assc-25/"&gt;annual conference&lt;/a&gt; about three years ago. According to Athena Demertzi, director of the Physiology of Cognition lab at the University of Liège, the topic of mind-blanking isn’t exactly new to some scientists, particularly those studying meditation. But interest in it has also been steadily gathering steam among researchers studying cognition and sleep in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cognitive scientists have begun to recognize that individuals may also experience moments of blankness during wakefulness in their everyday life,” she told Gizmodo in an email. “Meanwhile, in the field of sleep and dreaming research, special categories of dreams, such as so-called ‘white dreams,’ where individuals recall having dreamt but cannot retrieve any content, have drawn increasing attention.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Demertzi and her colleagues reviewed data from around 80 research papers relevant to mind blanking, which included studies of theirs where they measured people’s brain activity during reported moments of the volunteers having nothing on their mind. And they came to a simple conclusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mind blanking is real, it’s not just a matter of forgetting or a failure to report. At times during the day, our stream of thoughts can simply stop, leaving us with the experience of thinking about nothing,” she said. “In our review, we show that mind blanking is not merely a subjective impression or an illusion. It corresponds to a distinct brain state, one that differs from those associated with the experience of specific mental content.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, mind blanking is linked to its own unique patterns of brain activity. In studies where people were asked to explicitly clear their mind of any thoughts, for instance, brain scans revealed reduced activity in certain regions like the supplementary motor cortex and hippocampus. Data from electroencephalograms (EEG) also indicate that parts of the brain might enter a sleep-like state when we blank out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings, &lt;a href="https://info.cell.com/e3t/Ctc/I1+113/c3j3g04/VWTSBN5dMkWyW21PsDn3CCPPjW5SJqyG5vvQybKqQ-3qgyTW7Y8-PT6lZ3nbW2NNdc_60hM20W2b4LGj6Mns1TW3dmd2n98QVkDW7wR_g97wlt9JW7sl7jq9cdNSSN5dgs6b7_bThW1cYQ3L2ntVH0W9dmtl513PBZ5W2rXS_23k8XgVW5H0Krd3PGzMrW63M29y1ZZz97W35SRVN2-HR2xW54QqV95kmkvQVvfrCZ13tLBSW4Zjxtc1jvkLKW9lx5cy6s_-C7W3-sztB6HZXjSW3M6Hw56wF8l8W7TjCxw49RNV9N2LWNbWPhL1vN2TQ9mlmX0KHW7_RQVF6XJs0nW56GSCG1NP__zVvKZF544ZhHdW9krdTd8QSRltW8JvwWx4Cn5T3f4w_K4M04"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, also suggest that people experience mind blanking between 5% and 20% of the time on average. And certain people seem more prone to blanking out than others, such as those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). That said, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to help answer plenty more open questions about the nature of mind blanking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For instance, we don’t yet know how long mind blanking episodes typically last, or whether there are different types. Could some instances be voluntary? Might mind blanking occur during high-performance states, such as flow?” Demertzi noted. “A deeper understanding of its neural mechanisms is also needed. Is mind blanking the result of a failure to generate mental content, or is it a failure of access (where content exists but doesn’t reach conscious awareness)?”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors ultimately hope their work can inspire others in the field to start paying more attention to blanking out. Meanwhile, I just want scientists to one day unravel where exactly in the brain all my intrusive thoughts about my cat come from.&lt;/p&gt;

These fragments, made of a unique form of peptidoglycan, appear to accumulate in the liver and joints, triggering inflammation and immune responses even after the infection is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism resembles theories behind long COVID, where the immune system reacts to residual viral components. The findings could pave the way for targeted treatments and diagnostic tools that focus on inflammation rather than active infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Debris:&lt;/strong&gt; Lyme bacteria’s unique peptidoglycan can linger for months post-treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; These remnants may drive ongoing symptoms like joint pain and fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Targets:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers are exploring monoclonal antibodies to neutralize the leftover molecules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms that persist long after Lyme disease is treated are not uncommon — a 2022 study found that 14% of patients who were diagnosed and treated early with antibiotic therapy would still develop Post Treatment Lyme Disease (PTLD). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet doctors puzzle over the condition’s causes and how to help their patients through symptoms ranging from severe fatigue and cognitive challenges to body pain and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Northwestern University scientists believe they know what causes the treated infection to mimic chronic illness: the body may be responding to remnants of the &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; (the bacteria that causes Lyme) cell wall, which breaks down during treatment yet lingers in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matches one theory behind the underlying causes of long COVID-19 in that persisting viral molecules may encourage a strong, albeit unnecessary, immune response, said bacteriologist Brandon L. Jutras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lyme and long COVID-19 are clearly vastly different diseases, but it’s possible that they share a more general mechanism of inappropriate inflammation caused by remnants of a previous infection,” said Jutras, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The maladaptive response is a product of an infection, but perhaps not necessarily an active one in all cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peptidoglycan is a structural feature of virtually all bacterial cells and a common target of antibiotics, including penicillin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, to be published April 23 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, tracked the biodistribution of peptidoglycan from different bacteria, in real time, and found that all cell wall material is rapidly shed, but Lyme disease’s peptidoglycan persists for weeks to months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme arthritis is one of the more common long-term impacts of exposure to Lyme. If a patient has a swollen knee, for instance, it is full of synovial fluid, a natural lubricant found in joints. Jutras said his team looked at the fluid in humans and found that pieces of the peptidoglycan were omnipresent weeks to months after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the context of Lyme arthritis, if you give patients anti-inflammatory, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, they get better,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of these very same patients do not get better after oral and IV antibiotics, which implies there is something unique about how patients respond at a genetic level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jutras, who joined Northwestern faculty last summer, is an associate professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a member of the Center for Human Immunobiology at Northwestern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has been studying Lyme disease for more than 15 years, beginning in graduate school, and was previously an associate professor at Virginia Tech University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peptidoglycan is kind of like a structural skeleton in virtually all bacteria, acting as a big protective bag for the bacterium,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Penicillin and amoxicillin and dozens of other drugs target peptidoglycan synthesis because it’s a molecule that is specific to bacteria, it has similar structural features across the kingdom, and it’s essential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyme’s peptidoglycan, however, is structurally unique, and this difference may be behind its persistence in humans. Instead of looking the same as with other bacteria, the Lyme peptidoglycan is fundamentally distinct, which is facilitated in part by sucking up sugars from its tick vector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon bacterial cell death — by antibiotics or the immune system — surviving molecules tend to relocate to the liver, which can’t process the modified peptidoglycan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this modification, it seems likely that the peptidoglycan would clear right away, as in other infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unusual chemical properties of Borrelia peptidoglycan promote persistence, but it’s the individual patient response to the molecule that likely impacts the overall clinical outcome,” Jutras said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some patients will have a more robust or stronger immune response, which could result in a worse disease outcome, while the immune system of others may largely ignore the molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, in essence, it’s not about whether the molecule is there or not, it’s more about how an individual responds to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jutras hopes the groundbreaking findings will lead to development of more accurate tests, possibly for PTLD patients, and refined treatment options when antibiotics have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To effectively stymie PTLD, instead of neutralizing an infection that may no longer exist, efforts are underway to neutralize the inflammatory molecule, including weaponizing monoclonal antibodies to target peptidoglycan for destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R21AI159800, R01AI173256, R01AI178711), the Steven &amp;amp; Alexandra Cohen Foundation, the Department of Defense (TB220039), the Global Lyme Alliance and the Bay Area Lyme Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurology and Lyme disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b2722272a65392e322524272f380b2524393f233c2e383f2e3925652e2f3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Win Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Win Reynolds – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr2955" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The peptidoglycan of &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; can persist in discrete tissues and cause systemic responses consistent with chronic illness&lt;/a&gt;” by Brandon L.

One possible scenario involves the persistence of lingering antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have previously reported that patients with postinfectious Lyme arthritis often harbor the peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall of &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;, the Lyme disease agent, in the synovial fluid of their inflamed joints after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not yet known how &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG persists, in what form, or if it may play a role in other postinfectious complications after Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a murine model, we developed a real-time in vivo system to track &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG as a function of cell wall chemistry and validated our findings using both molecular and cellular approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike typical bacterial PG, the unique chemical properties of polymeric &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG drive murine liver accumulation, where the cell wall material persists for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kupffer cells and hepatocytes phagocytose and retain &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG and, although liver occupancy coincides with minimal pathology, both organ-specific and secreted protein profiles produced under these conditions bear some similarities to reported proteins enriched in patients with chronic illness after acute infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, transcriptomic profiling indicated that &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; PG affects energy metabolism in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how a pathogenic molecule can persist after agent clearance, potentially contributing to illness after infection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 14:59:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE16ZVBQMlVvcW1yMzhZS0lHTW4wUHJISE1kVEhEcWR0WnVHcFVzR0FDdWFubUMzX3NIWV9wdVNpRl9nMzRqdnRGNWhVV1dCcTFobUxQMzNZMlBWd1UyckJsMDA5ai1DYVNnVFZPa0dKeV8</guid></item><item><title>它曾经在美国被消灭，现在，我们可能处于流行病的边缘。-石板 | It Was Once Eliminated From the U.S. Now, We Could Be on the Verge of an Epidemic. - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxObWhSSDUzSGU2am1ET3V3cFJKbVBlN1NoRVFYdmFrRXJONTlvR1EtMWxwcHJoQWNtVXBqeDZJUlNOVmtEaV9lWl84OUJzRmU2OGFMMlZOb1RyenVFbzE5X2wyOTY1eWYtUlpCckhPY241aHY3Q29CVkpUbE1rRVljMGt3SWxVUzdmR1RN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

Before this year, there had been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/06/measles-third-death-new-normal/"&gt;three deaths&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the years since the U.S. eliminated the disease (meaning that the disease was no longer continuously spreading) in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb4001j3b75czf1c06t@published"&gt;It’s concerning. The numbers are high, especially considering we’re less than halfway through the year. It’s very possible that &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/third-measles-death"&gt;cases are being underreported&lt;/a&gt;. And they keep rising, with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00786-w"&gt;no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it will slow anytime soon. Which leads us to the million-dollar question: How bad could measles get this year?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001k3b75whtg35o0@published"&gt;While it’s impossible to say for certain, experts say that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/measles-epidemic-texas.html"&gt;we’re standing on a precipice&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not out of the question that measles could rip through the entire country like wildfire. If each case is a spark, “the brush is burning right now,” says epidemiologist Michael Mina, who studies how infections and vaccines affect human health. Whether the burning brush will ignite the whole forest just depends on how long our strained firewalls can hold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001l3b752lp8jc5q@published"&gt;Measles could continue breaking out in these bubbles (bad, but relatively confined to certain geographic areas). Or, if those bubbles grow large enough, they could converge and turn into a countrywide epidemic (very, very bad). To imagine &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; bad it could get, we can look to Europe, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/opinion/measles-epidemic-texas.html"&gt;Mina recently argued in a New York Times op-ed&lt;/a&gt;. In 2018, the continent saw more than 80,000 cases, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, and over 70 deaths, Mina says, including in countries that had achieved—and subsequently lost—elimination status. That’s possible here, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="176" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001m3b75xna6519c@published"&gt;If it feels like this is happening suddenly, it’s not. The U.S. has been moving toward this moment for decades, says Mina, long &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health secretary&lt;/a&gt;. There are a mix of factors. For one, public health is often a victim of its own success: Once a disease has been wiped out for long enough, people forget how bad it was. In the days before the measles vaccine (aka the MMR vaccine), almost every kid got measles, says &lt;a href="https://shea-online.org/dr-david-weber-named-incoming-president-of-the-society-for-healthcare-epidemiology-of-america/"&gt;David Weber&lt;/a&gt;, president of the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. Every year 3 million to 4 million people were infected; nearly 50,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;were hospitalized&lt;/a&gt;; hundreds died. The vaccine changed that. Those who survived the disease decades ago might protest, &lt;em&gt;Hey, I had the measles and just stayed home for a week, no biggie!&lt;/em&gt; People forget how many people died, says Weber. Not to mention, there are new parents today who never had to deal with the measles at all. For many, the idea of their kid getting the measles feels totally theoretical.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb5001n3b7545v6mxq4@published"&gt;The consequence of improved public health is that it becomes harder to convince people to go out of their way to vaccinate. Vaccination has always been hard to argue for; sticking a child with a needle full of some substance “goes against a parent’s natural evolutionary instincts,” says Mina. He doesn’t fault parents who worry about vaccination. Instead, he says, it’s the onus of public health officials to make sure parents are “exceedingly comfortable” to push back against those (totally reasonable!) instincts and make an informed decision to protect their child. That requires making sure parents have the information they need to evaluate the risks and benefits of a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb6001o3b75krhct2ix@published"&gt;Vaccine messaging by public health officials has left much to be desired, says Mina. Instead of acknowledging and addressing parents’ worries, they’ve taken a more paternalistic approach—i.e., “Just get the vaccine, it’ll be fine!” Then, early on in the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assured people that you couldn’t get COVID-19 after getting vaccinated, when you &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;in fact still get COVID-19, albeit a much milder version. People felt like they’d been lied to, recalls &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/about-us"&gt;Jess Steier&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the public health data science consulting firm (and &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/podcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;) Unbiased Science. “They burned the bridge of trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb6001p3b75pq7l21nn@published"&gt;Add all that to the fact that the MMR vaccine has been erroneously linked to autism (studies continue to show &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-on-vaccines-and-autism"&gt;no association between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;). The seed was planted way back in 1998 thanks to a paper in the Lancet—a paper that was later found to be riddled with faulty data and has since been retracted. But that didn’t matter. It had already set off a movement, fanned by RFK Jr. and other &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/13/opinion/rfk-jr-is-a-vaccine-cynic.html"&gt;vaccine cynics&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, measles vaccination rates had been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/13/upshot/vaccination-rates.html"&gt;dropping for many years&lt;/a&gt; before the pandemic came along.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001q3b75o8hbhq61@published"&gt;And we really need people to get the vaccine. Measles is incredibly contagious, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00786-w"&gt;far more so than COVID or flu&lt;/a&gt;. A single person with measles can walk through, say, a grocery store and continue to infect people for up to two hours after they’ve left the space, says Weber. Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of unvaccinated people exposed to measles will become infected.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001r3b75xnq2o75a@published"&gt;While measles’ mortality rate is relatively low compared with other diseases—about 0.2 percent of people infected with measles in the U.S. will die—the hospitalization rate is incredibly high: 20 percent, for people who haven’t been vaccinated. “This is not a benign disease,” says Weber. “How many infectious diseases do we have that 10 to 20 percent of the people end up in the hospital?” (It’s certainly not that high for flu, COVID, or other respiratory illnesses.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001s3b75jp4hxip7@published"&gt;All that being said, here’s the very &lt;em&gt;worst-&lt;/em&gt;case scenario for what could happen next with measles, according to Steier’s calculations. Given measles’ mortality rate of 0.2 percent, if the &lt;em&gt;entire &lt;/em&gt;unvaccinated U.S. population (23.5 million people) were exposed to measles, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIEM3qQuFTC/?img_index=3"&gt;nearly 50,000&lt;/a&gt; people could die. (This would likely occur over several years.) Given that 90 percent of exposed unvaccinated people become infected, and then 20 percent of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; number face hospitalization, millions could end up in the hospital, and some with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857"&gt;potentially lifelong complications&lt;/a&gt;, including neurological damage, intellectual disabilities, and hearing loss. They also face the risk of something called &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;, where the immune system “forgets” its immunity to other infectious diseases for a period of weeks to years. Even if they survive the measles, they could suffer or die from something else &lt;em&gt;because &lt;/em&gt;they got the measles. None of these calculations include the 22 million immunocompromised Americans who face heightened risk even if they were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001t3b75nyt9nq44@published"&gt;It’s unclear what a nationwide outbreak would mean for the vaccinated population, says Steier. The MMR vaccine is &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-outbreak-vaccine-booster-titers.html"&gt;incredibly effective&lt;/a&gt;—roughly 97 percent of people are protected with two shots—but it’s not been tested in an environment where there are thousands of cases. “We could see more breakthrough cases of measles, potentially,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb7001u3b75iv1ypjlv@published"&gt;It might also change how we live our lives. Like COVID days, we could see travel advisories or requirements to carry proof of immunity (which could cause procedural challenges, considering how many people are immune due to prior infection and thus have no vaccination records to prove their immunity, says Weber). This, of course, will depend on how the federal government responds.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001v3b75hz2r3mw5@published"&gt;Again, those are worst-case scenarios. How exactly measles will play out isn’t certain. But the way forward is clear, experts say: The only thing that can end the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine, full stop. That’s our firewall. In the current outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;96 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; who have been infected are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. In the case of a measles infection, which can take days to develop symptoms, even a vaccination right before an individual gets exposed and infected can still make a difference in protecting them. That means “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/essential-programme-on-immunization/implementation/catch-up-vaccination"&gt;catch-up&lt;/a&gt;” vaccination campaigns can be “very, very powerful” if an unvaccinated community gets hit hard with measles, says Mina. In other words, there are things that can be done late in the game, even if we cross into wildfire territory.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001w3b75cnk8nlfq@published"&gt;Alas, we continue to see mixed messaging about vaccines by the Department of Health and Human Services. In the past, kids dying of measles might have led to swift action by the CDC, such as widespread catch-up vaccination campaigns (some CDC employees &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-measles-cases-missed-texas-us-rfkjr-rcna201426"&gt;have been deployed&lt;/a&gt; to Texas, though resources are low after federal funding cuts last month). But even after the first child’s death in February, RFK Jr. continued to question the MMR vaccine and tout therapies, like vitamin A, that &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-rfk-jr-vitamin-a-research-vaccination-nutrition-debunk.html"&gt;are not preventive measures&lt;/a&gt;. It wasn’t until early April that he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/07/nx-s1-5354900/hhs-rfk-endorses-mmr-measles-vaccine-stoking-supporters-fury"&gt;finally endorsed the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. And yet “the only way that we can prevent measles is MMR,” says Steier. “It’s bananas that we’re talking about anything else.”&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001x3b753sezczft@published"&gt;The good news is that, regardless of lagging federal efforts, individuals can opt to protect themselves &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/03/measles-outbreak-vaccine-booster-titers.html"&gt;with a vaccine&lt;/a&gt; that is incredibly effective. If you’re in an outbreak area or planning to travel, make sure you and your children are vaccinated, says Weber. Infants can receive an early vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-vaccine-can-young-children-get-early-dose-mmr-shot-rcna198038"&gt;at 6 months&lt;/a&gt; (this would not be considered to be one of the standard doses, so they’d later still need the full two-shot regimen). As the threat has grown more imminent, “we are seeing an increased awareness amongst millions of people,” notes Mina. Hopefully many of them will update their risk-benefit analysis and get vaccinated, he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001y3b7581wzrae7@published"&gt;In the meantime, experts are keeping an eye out for red flags that we’re going the wrong way. If outbreak bubbles continue to grow—or worse, converge—we move closer toward a national epidemic, Mina says. Steier worries about a study that RFK Jr. has ordered to investigate the link between autism and vaccines, which will be headed by &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/dc-warns-major-measles-exposure-hhs-names-geier-study-autism-and-vaccines"&gt;David Geier&lt;/a&gt;, a man who &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;has been disciplined for practicing medicine without a license&lt;/a&gt;, has no advanced science degree, and has suggested for decades that vaccines cause autism. If the study claims to find a link (again, the existence of such a link has already been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;investigated thoroughly and disproven&lt;/a&gt;), Steier anticipates that vaccination rates could plunge—the opposite of what needs to be happening.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9ub1qb8001z3b75p1dbjwoo@published"&gt;Until vaccination rates improve, we’ll teeter on the edge with this disease. It’s not clear what will happen with measles next—but we’re not in a good &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;spot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The analysis, based on nearly two million people, showed that the more components of metabolic syndrome a person had, the greater their dementia risk, with women and those in their 40s being most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study does not prove causation, it highlights the importance of managing cardiovascular and metabolic health during midlife. Preventive lifestyle changes could play a key role in reducing early cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s and Vascular Dementia:&lt;/strong&gt; Metabolic syndrome was linked to both major dementia subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70% Risk Increase:&lt;/strong&gt; People with all five components of metabolic syndrome had a 70% higher risk of young-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex and Age Disparity:&lt;/strong&gt; Women and individuals in their 40s faced the highest increased risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a larger waistline, high blood pressure and other risk factors that make up metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia, according to a study published on April 23, 2025, online in &lt;em&gt;Neurology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young-onset dementia is diagnosed before the age of 65. The study does not prove that metabolic syndrome causes young-onset dementia, it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metabolic syndrome is defined as having excess belly fat plus two or more of the following risk factors: high blood pressure, high blood sugar, higher than normal triglycerides, which are a type of fat found in the blood, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or “good” cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most dementia is diagnosed in older age, young-onset dementia occurs while a person is still working and perhaps raising a family,” said study author Minwoo Lee, MD, PhD, of Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in Anyang, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our study found having metabolic syndrome in middle age is a risk factor for young-onset dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers reviewed national health insurance data in South Korea to identify nearly two million people between the ages of 40 and 60 who had a health check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The check-up included measurements of waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar, triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Of all participants, 25% had metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over an average follow-up period of eight years, 8,921 people, or 0.45% of all participants, developed dementia. For those with metabolic syndrome, the incidence rate was 0.86 cases per 1,000 person-years, compared to 0.49 cases for those without metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person-years represent both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, education and health factors such as level of physical activity, depression and stroke, researchers found metabolic syndrome was associated with a 24% higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific types of dementia, it was associated with a 12% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease and a 21% increased risk of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found female participants with metabolic syndrome had a 34% increased risk of dementia compared to male participants who had a 15% increased risk. People in their 40s had a greater risk than people in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found each component of metabolic syndrome was associated with an increased risk of dementia, which was cumulative. People with all five components had a 70% increased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking and reducing stress, may help reduce the risk of young-onset dementia,” said Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future research that follows people over longer periods of time and uses brain scans to look for biomarkers of dementia is needed to confirm and expand upon our findings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that researchers did not review genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Korean National Research Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this metabolism and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8b6bbb7b6aab9bc98b9b9b6f6bbb7b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natalie Conrad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Natalie Conrad – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:56:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5YNk4wS3poV0c4d0tTQl9UZXZRQ1A2Y2k5cXViVjJhaHlNRHJfakFVZUh6X0FNLXRVMlNXOXFoWDBGTUEwUTlCbG11enBJOGx0RkZocUFtR1NUdXBCVXhpNUMtWFlPUVdLRjNaLVJLZUI</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州确认第9例麻疹病例，警告可能的接触部位- MLive.com | Michigan confirms 9th measles case, warns of possible exposure site - MLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQU29FSkZRLWpXZmZrVE1TdmdNV3U5dTRsZ00waDhwd1VDVTZ0a0pfMVRWZlNBSG85YVRZYXItQXI5dFhQMHY1aDlQTWl2NWllc1U1RFFPczIwLXJtYWVtMWpPQmpvNDQ3MHVZdms4SHU5LTQ3Y1NrakVfblJMWk80OVp3b2U4MWYxWG8wdGNYUXRESm9tWkpyaWVzU3I0WERsei02LWFGT3RJd9IBvgFBVV95cUxQR2ZfWUxEd1B5VkdobWw3X1hmWDNQQk1ralB6QTQ4d1FySkEweW5qQ1V5OEQ2ZVlGUkcxcUY2XzNGUjU0MFd5ZDY5bGtHMDljRUJ0M3NiRTlCcVBaTjB0U21VeGQyRGh1OEdBaHFhRkdEY0lxak1hSjhUTkNkdTJoVFdTdnJIVWxpeEQwSTNFM2VqVTZYOS1qWDFQeC1wSFowQmpicGxjLWNCZVBVSlN6czBucDRzU3NjQXByYWxR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DVZT743OGNFOXBXJE5HX64Q3QM"&gt;Ingham County has its second confirmed measles infection of the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HIHEJVD5ZBHF5KHJFFHEXGH3FY"&gt;A 1-year-old boy tested positive for the highly infectious disease Tuesday, April 22, after being exposed to the county’s first confirmed case earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="425SRSHKNJAQHC55TYGUMLQXWI"&gt;The boy experienced only mild symptoms, Ingham County health officials reported late Wednesday, April 23. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6N6MOZBHD5BBNI6QE2WHKEL65Y"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/04/measles-trending-toward-worst-year-in-decades-warns-michigans-top-doc.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/04/measles-trending-toward-worst-year-in-decades-warns-michigans-top-doc.html"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measles trending toward worst year in decades, warns Michigan’s top doc&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3TEBTIKQOVF5RJ7EIW5VSUDDAI"&gt;He was “age-appropriately vaccinated,” which likely means he got his first dose, recommended at 12 to 15 months, but not a second and final dose, recommended at 4 to 6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GUVENI3FE5BYTAPSBL6DUBCB7U"&gt;The local health department said early isolation and limited exposure means the risk of infection for the public remains low.

These cultural meanings of affection, fun, and belonging made firearms easily accessible to the shooters—often without barriers at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, parents purchased the firearms used or stored them in places their children could reach. The findings highlight that gun culture wasn’t just background context—it was a formative part of the shooters’ lives, shaping both their identities and their access to deadly weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural Bonding:&lt;/strong&gt; Many shooters described guns as symbols of love, friendship, or identity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy Access:&lt;/strong&gt; All shooters had unrestricted access to firearms—often supplied or enabled by family.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventive Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; The study urges focusing on reducing gun access and improving student belonging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new analysis of school shootings in the U.S. suggests that most shooters had a social background in which guns were a key leisure item, with attached meanings of bonding and affection, which also translated into easy access to firearms. Anne Nassauer of the University of Erfurt, Germany, presents these findings in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; on April 23, 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For U.S. minors, guns are the leading cause of death. Some of these deaths occur in school shootings, where a current or former student fires at people at their school. Discussions of school shootings often cite the unique gun culture of the U.S. as a causative factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109074"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child with a gun." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/school-shooter-gun-culture-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The findings suggest that research on how to prevent school shootings could focus on making guns more difficult for students to access and on finding ways to foster student belonging. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, few studies have methodically analyzed the role of gun culture in school shooters’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, Nassauer analyzed all known U.S. school shootings across U.S. history (83 cases), some of which resulted in no deaths, some in a few deaths, and some in many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from court, police, and media records, she assembled a case file for each shooter and conducted cross-case and statistical comparisons to determine whether any patterns in gun culture emerged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggests that a distinct pocket of U.S. gun culture plays a key role in school shooters’ lives. Specifically, most shooters in the study came from a social background in which guns were key leisure items that were often important for family bonding time, often from a young age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some shooters described guns as being their “only friend” or the “love of [their] life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, all shooters in the study faced no difficulty in obtaining the guns they used in the school shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggests that this ease of access stemmed from the cultural meanings assigned to guns within the shooters’ social settings—namely, fun, bonding, and belonging—which translated into practices that made accessing guns easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, some parents had bought the guns their children then used for the school shooting, while others kept guns in easily accessible parts of their house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that research on how to prevent school shootings could focus on making guns more difficult for students to access and on finding ways to foster student belonging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author adds: “All school shooters in U.S. history had easy access to the firearms they used — even those who were very young or severely mentally ill. Many came from a gun culture where firearms are symbols of affection, bonding, and identity. The weapons were often freely accessible in the shooters’ homes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows school shooters don’t just use guns, but many grow up in worlds where guns are central to identity and belonging. Gun culture isn’t just a backdrop — it’s a formative part of many school shooters’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For many school shooters guns were what they called their ‘only friend’, or ‘the love of their life’. We can’t understand school shootings without understanding how gun culture shapes youth identities and gun access.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Guns don’t cause school shootings, but they make them possible — and often far too easy. There’s not a single school shooting in the US where a shooter had trouble getting a firearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So we have to ask: Why do only those with easy gun access do it? Are other potential shooters deterred because they don’t have a gun within easy reach?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and gun violence research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8a7a6adb8baadbbbb88b8a4a7bbe6a7baaf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hanna Abdallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hanna Abdallah – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0322195" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;“The only friend I had was my gun”: A mixed-methods study of gun culture in school shootings&lt;/a&gt;” by Anne Nassauer et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The only friend I had was my gun”: A mixed-methods study of gun culture in school shootings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firearms are the leading cause of death for minors in the United States and US gun culture is often discussed as a reason behind the prevalence of school shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, few studies systematically analyze if there is a connection between the two: Do school shooters show a distinct gun culture?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article studies gun culture in action in school shootings. It studies if school shooters show distinct meanings and practices around firearms prior to the shooting, as well as patterns in access to firearms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, I analyze a full sample of US school shootings. Relying on publicly available court, police, and media data, I combine qualitative in-depth analyses with cross-case comparisons and descriptive statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest most school shooters come from a social setting in which firearms are a crucial leisure activity and hold meanings of affection, friendship, and bonding. These meanings translate into practices: all school shooters had easy access to the firearms they used for the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings contribute to research on firearms and youth violence, public health, as well as the sociology of culture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:34:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNdEYxZFppWE85cXhpdk1ERlYzMkk5N3RaaUJiYUtxMmtnNjFjaEgyeHJCQ1djNU9hQUtFN0RoMjgzQWlzU3F1SVd0SHpxN09aZ2JoQ2VkNkphLVhOdy1QTkVxalJ2cndEeTJiMUtpeWx0Q3lQVUFWVUFoSW5INDVobg</guid></item><item><title>美国主要机场在感染世界上最具传染性疾病的患者通过后处于红色警戒状态-每日邮报 | Major US airport on red alert after patient infected with world's most infectious disease passes through - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials are sounding the alarm over a potential measles exposure at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An infected infant visited the airport's S Concourse with their family, potentially exposing others to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14618263/Michigan-state-measles-Ingham-County-baby-girl.html"&gt;the world's most infectious disease.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person was at the airport - the largest in the Pacific North West, and one of the busiest in America - on April 17 between 4:50pm to 7:45pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The individual also passed through the customs and baggage claim areas before exiting through the south end of main terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They later visited Seattle Children's Emergency Department after developing symptoms on April 17, 18 and 20, and they were admitted on April 20.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a major outbreak in West &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-bae8b720-10af-11f0-986b-856b684cc348" class=""&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, that has already sickened around 500 people and led to two deaths, marking the first fatalities in a decade in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, cases crossed a grim milestone last month surpassing the tally for the whole of 2024 and reaching their highest level since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials suspect the latest patient was exposed to measles while traveling abroad. They had not yet been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials are warning anyone who may have been exposed to the virus to monitor themselves for symptoms for the next two weeks, particularly if they are unvaccinated, and contact their health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone who develops symptoms is encouraged to immediately contact health services for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seattle–Tacoma International Airport is the primary international airport serving Seattle and its surrounding metropolitan area.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2024, it served 52.6 million passengers, ranking 11th in the US by passenger numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say no infections linked to the infected individual have been reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the matter, Seattle-based public health worker Elysia Gonzales said: 'Measles is highly contagious and if you don't have immunity, you can get it just by being in an area where a person with measles has been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've seen an increase in measles cases around the world and in the US, so it's an important time to check your vaccination status and get vaccinated if you aren't protected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world, with one person capable of spreading the virus to nine out of every 10 people they meet if those individuals are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is transmitted via breathing in infectious droplets that can remain suspended in the air for two hours after an infected patient passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients develop a fever, cough, and runny nose, which then develops into a rash that starts at the hairline before spreading to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's no cure for measles, with doctors instead using antibiotics to treat related infections and IV fluids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If unvaccinated, about one in five people who are infected are hospitalized while one in 20 children develop pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among unvaccinated children infected with measles, about one in 1,000 will develop encephalitis — or swelling of the brain. And nearly one to three out of every 1,000 will die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine is 97 percent effective at preventing an infection and is required for children attending school in some states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, Gonzales says: 'Children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

ROACH: I thought you could help with a stubborn problem. I am a healthy and active 78-year-old woman who, I admit, likes to look younger than my age. The problem is my skin, especially on my hands and arms; I get these bruises that look unsightly and take a while to resolve. I hear it is from age-related thin skin. My friends of this generation also complain about these red spots or bruises. They don’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6Q75IUAN75FVROIP2ET3TZKZM4"&gt;Could I take vitamin K or increase my platelets so as to limit their happening? I’ve read not to take aspirin or any pain reliever. Is there any medicine to take to help my blood coagulate better or make my skin thicker? -- S.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BJ4FHKD5CJHPJPLGWLOMEBGH5U"&gt;ANSWER: This common problem is called solar purpura, and it is largely the sun causing the damage to the skin, thinning it with age. Avoiding the sun and moisturizing your skin diligently can reduce the risk of this happening. Once it’s happened, these measures are still important for preventing it from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="X3HW7MPFJRBPFPNL2VPIQOXDOU"&gt;You should still avoid the sun and moisturize to prevent the condition from worsening. One study showed that bioflavinoid supplements helped reduce new bruises. These aren’t particularly expensive, but you can also get them through food, specifically citrus and other fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WM3GGPWBEREF3NIROJXWGJMXQM"&gt;Vitamin K deficiency causes clotting problems, but taking more vitamin K doesn’t help. Aspirin does reduce the effectiveness of platelets, but if you are prescribed it (for blockages in the heart, for example), you should definitely keep taking it. Occasional ibuprofen has little effect on platelets, and acetaminophen (Tylenol) has none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: For years, I have been plagued by a chronic nasal drip. It’s usually most present in the mornings, though it seems to be intermittent during the day. I frequently have to wipe or blow my nose. I thought it might be due to allergies, so I have been taking a Zyrtec tablet every morning. But it doesn’t seem to have any effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="55MVLIRNOVBQZK3WX6MPAOF73I"&gt;I talked with my primary care physician about this, but he didn’t have any recommendations. I don’t know what is going on or how to stop this. Do you have any recommendations? -- R.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ERNB4OIKOZBQ3ESMDTVAMJJNH4"&gt;ANSWER: An antihistamine like Zyrtec is a reasonable thing to try as allergic rhinitis often responds to antihistamines. (We just love our Latin and Greek names, and “rhinitis” comes from the Greek roots for “inflammation of the nose.”) Since an antihistamine didn’t work, it seems likely that you might have nonallergic rhinitis, and a nasal spray like ipratropium is usually effective for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VFTE6EDO2FAELN3PQKG2L5HYEM"&gt;I also recommend azelastine nasal spray, which is now available over the counter as “Astepro.” There are some steps you can do to help your environmental risk, such as reducing dust and avoiding excess dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKQRSIWKVZEA3AFWRSDDXZMCBA"&gt;I warn people against the habitual use of nasal decongestants like Afrin, which should only be used for a day or two -- never more than three. Once the body gets used to it, nasal congestion will worsen every time a person tries to go without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TPKIIVFQUJHIXATSWXKOI2IM7M"&gt;If the nasal spray doesn’t do the job, I’d recommend an evaluation by an expert, such as an otorhinolaryngologist, who may need to look for nasal polyps, laryngopharyngeal reflux, and other less-common causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HTULFGZG4NDGHFQWUJU7C2XQ4M"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

The vaccine showed effectiveness in mice and non-human primates, prompting researchers to pursue human clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It targets a specific region of the tau protein, pT181, linked to Alzheimer’s-related brain damage and cognitive decline.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because we’ve shown efficacy in the non-human primate, I think that is suggesting to us it’s much closer to a clinical trial,” Bhaskar said, adding that he and his colleagues are seeking funding from venture capitalists and the Alzheimer’s Association to launch a Phase 1 trial in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tau is a naturally occurring protein that helps stabilize neurons, but when it undergoes a process called phosphorylation, it deforms and is ejected from neurons into the extracellular space, creating the tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several new FDA-approved treatments for drugs that reduce levels of amyloid beta, another protein implicated in Alzheimer’s pathology, but they have only a modest effect on the progression of the disease, leading many to wonder whether targeting tau might be a better bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The active immunotherapy developed at UNM generates antibodies that bind to pT181, a region of the altered tau protein that has been identified as an Alzheimer’s biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2019 paper published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Vaccines&lt;/em&gt;, Bhaskar and his colleagues reported that when the vaccine was given to mice bred to express pathological tau they generated antibodies, reduced the extent of the tangles in key brain structures and improved their performance on tests to gauge their cognitive disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new paper expands on those findings. The vaccine elicited a strong immune response in two other strains of mice bred to develop tau-related disease – one of which had a human tau gene inserted in its genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with the University of California, Davis, and the California National Primate Research Center  the vaccine was also administered to macaques, primates whose immune systems and brains are closer to humans. They also showed a strong and durable immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested antibodies in the serum from the immunized monkeys on samples of blood plasma drawn from people with mild cognitive impairment, often a precursor to full-blown Alzheimer’s dementia, as well as the sera in brain tissue from people who had died from Alzheimer’s, and found that they bound to the human version of the tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine was developed using a virus-like particle (VLP) platform developed by Bryce Chackerian and David Peabody, Bhaskar’s colleagues in Molecular Genetics &amp;amp; Microbiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VLPs are essentially viruses whose DNA has been removed, rendering them harmless. Snippets of proteins – in this case pT181 – can be attached to their surface, rendering them visible to immune cells on the lookout for invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VLP-based vaccines have been shown to create durable immunity, with one primary inoculation and two booster shots, Bhaskar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don’t require adjuvants – substances (such as aluminum) administered with a vaccine to enhance the immune response. And, they have been shown to be safe in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicole Maphis, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the UNM Department of Neurosciences, was the first author on both of the vaccine papers. She said the collaboration with UC Davis was critical for validating the vaccine’s efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was important because it extends our work in an animal model that is more similar to humans,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mice don’t have a human immune response, but these non-human primates, their immune response is much more similar to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85e6ebe2e4f7e6ece4c5f6e4e9f0e1abf0ebe8abe0e1f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Ramirez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unm.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chris Ramirez – University of New Mexico&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques&lt;/a&gt;” by Kiran Bhaskar et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting of phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 by a Qβ virus-like particle vaccine is safe, highly immunogenic, and reduces disease severity in mice and rhesus macaques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathological accumulation of tau (pTau) contributes to various tauopathies, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and correlates with cognitive decline. A rapid surge in tau-targeted approaches via anti-sense oligonucleotides, active/passive immunotherapies suggests that targeting p-Tau is a viable strategy against tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHOD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We describe a multi-species validation of our previously described Qß virus-like particle (VLP)–based vaccine technology targeting phosphorylated tau on threonine 181 (pT181-Qß).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two vaccine doses of pT181-Qß, without any adjuvants, elicited robust antibody responses in two different mouse models of tauopathy (PS19 and hTau) and rhesus macaques. In mouse models, vaccination reduced AT180+ hyperphosphorylated, Sarkosyl insoluble, Gallyas silver positive tau, inflammasomes/neuroinflammation, and improved recognition memory and motor function without inducing adverse T-cell activation. Anti-pT181 antibodies are reactive to pTau in human AD brains, engage pT181+ tau in human brain lysates, and are central nervous system bioavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70101-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest the translational utility of pT181-Qß against tauopathies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The company behind the product, Contraline, says the approach offers a reversible alternative to condoms and vasectomies, with the hydrogel designed to break down in the body after a set period of time, restoring fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Contraline has released details of its phase 1 clinical trial, revealing Adam can successfully block the release of sperm for 24 months, with no sperm detected in the semen of the two participants who have so far reached this time point in the trial. In addition, it said no serious adverse events had been recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is really exciting because our goal since day one has been to create a two-year-long male contraceptive – that is what the demand is for: a two-year-long, temporary or reversible male birth control. And we have the first data to show that that’s possible,” said Kevin Eisenfrats, the founder and chief executive of Contraline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eisenfrats said the 25 participants in the clinical trial were enrolled at different points in time, with more results expected to follow. “It’s great proof of concept,” he added..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eisenfrats said the implant was inserted in a minimally invasive procedure that took about 10 minutes and used local anaesthetic, meaning the patient remained awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Adam is not the first male contraceptive in development that acts by blocking the sperm ducts (vas deferens), although Eisenfrats said some other implants had used materials that did not break down in the body. He said there was little data to show fertility was restored after these were removed, while there were also concerns such implants could cause scarring of the vas deferens and lead to permanent sterilisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The results from the Adam clinical trial have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal and do not include data on the reversibility of the implant. However, Eisenfrats said the hydrogel had a predictable lifespan and had been shown to break down over time in animal trials, with work using lower doses in men revealing a shorter period of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The way to think about this is sort of like the IUD [intrauterine device] for men,” Eisenfrats said, adding that after a two-year period men could decide whether to get another implant. The team is working on a procedure to enable “on-demand reversal”.

Researchers found that boys born to mothers who experienced early-life adversity gained significantly more weight per day than average, despite being full-term, healthy, and mostly breastfed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest early metabolic alterations linked to intergenerational trauma, with the male placenta being more vulnerable to maternal stress-related factors like inflammation and cortisol. While the changes raise concerns about long-term health risks, researchers emphasize that these effects are modifiable with early monitoring and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Only male infants showed excessive early weight gain linked to maternal trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Boys gained up to 78g/day—well above the WHO’s recommended 30g/day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Placental Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Male placentas are more sensitive to inflammatory signals from maternal stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adverse situations experienced by the mother during childhood – such as neglect or physical, psychological or sexual violence – can trigger excessive weight gain in male children as early as the first two months of life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was shown in a study that followed 352 pairs of newborns and their mothers in the cities of Guarulhos and São Paulo, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109066"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and baby." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-weight-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Another important issue is that the placenta of male fetuses tends to be more susceptible to fluctuations in substances and metabolites present in the maternal bloodstream compared to female placentas. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses indicated the occurrence of very early metabolic alterations in babies that not only led to weight gain above that expected for their age but also have the potential to increase the future risk of developing obesity and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first article resulting from a Thematic Project supported by FAPESP and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States. Using a database of 580 vulnerable pregnant women, the group is studying intergenerational trauma, i.e., negative effects that can be passed on to future generations, even if the offspring have not lived through such experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted by researchers from Columbia and Duke Universities, both in the United States, and the School of Medicine of the Federal University of São Paulo (EPM-UNIFESP) in Brazil, the study focuses on issues related to mother-baby interaction, development, and mental and physical health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that although the babies were born weighing within the expected parameters, in the first few days of life they showed altered weight gain, far above what’s recommended as ideal by the World Health Organization [&lt;em&gt;WHO&lt;/em&gt;],” says Andrea Parolin Jackowski, professor at UNIFESP and coordinator of the project in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, the ideal weight gain in the first stage of life is up to 30 grams per day. However, the male babies in the study had an average weight gain of 35 grams per day – with some gaining up to 78 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The babies who took part in the study were born full-term, healthy and within the ideal weight range. All of the pregnancies we followed were low-risk, but our data showed that every adversity the mother experienced during childhood increased the babies’ weight gain by 1.8 grams per day. And this was limited to males,” the researcher reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jackowski, there are many factors that can influence a baby’s weight in early life, and maternal childhood trauma appears to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the analysis took care to control for so-called confounders – variables related to the mothers’ stress levels that could influence the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some examples include lifetime trauma experiences (the effects of which are cumulative) and current trauma, as well as education level and socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also important to note that 70% of the babies who took part in the study were exclusively breastfed. The other 30% were on mixed feeding [&lt;em&gt;a combination of breast milk and formula&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that they weren’t eating filled cookies or other foods that could actually change their weight. Therefore, the results suggest the occurrence of an early metabolic alteration in these babies,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why only boys?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researcher, maternal trauma during childhood only had an impact on the weight of male babies because of physiological variations in the placenta associated with the sex of the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placenta is a temporary organ composed of maternal and fetal tissue that shows structural differences and differences in the regulation and expression of steroids and proteins depending on the sex of the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Male fetuses develop strategies to maintain constant growth in the face of an adverse intrauterine environment, leading to a greater risk of prematurity and fetal death,” explains the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she adds, childhood adversity is known to increase the risk of depression and anxiety during pregnancy, which can lead to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in the intrauterine environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “It appears that the placenta of female fetuses adapts to protect them, slowing down the growth rate without restricting intrauterine growth [&lt;em&gt;i.e., the size of the baby is within the expected range at the end of pregnancy&lt;/em&gt;] and allowing for a higher survival rate,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important issue is that the placenta of male fetuses tends to be more susceptible to fluctuations in substances and metabolites present in the maternal bloodstream compared to female placentas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, in these cases of trauma, it can become more permeable, causing the male fetus to be more exposed to inflammatory factors resulting from high levels of stress, such as cortisol and interleukins, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work now published is the first to identify intergenerational trauma as a trigger for physical changes at such an early age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s already known that adverse events in the mother’s childhood can trigger psychological and developmental problems, but our study is pioneering in showing that they can affect physical problems, such as weight gain, as early as the first two months of life,” says Jackowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the research team, which includes Vinicius O. Santana and FAPESP postdoctoral fellow Aline C. Ramos, will follow the weight development of the children of mothers who suffered adversity in childhood until they are 24 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to follow them for longer because we want to investigate the impact of the introduction of food, which usually occurs at 6 months of age,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers explain, the research suggests that metabolic changes can be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a matter of determinism. We need to monitor how the metabolism and inflammatory factors behave in these babies over a longer period of time to understand how to modulate this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to know that all of this is modifiable, and we’re now going to look at how we can intervene,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#056d77606c6b607771456364756076752b6777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-87078-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sex-specific association between maternal childhood adversities and offspring’s weight gain in a Brazilian cohort&lt;/a&gt;” by Andrea Parolin Jackowski et al. &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-specific association between maternal childhood adversities and offspring’s weight gain in a Brazilian cohort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to negative health and developmental outcomes in offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, whether maternal ACEs influence infant weight gain in the first months of life, and if this effect differs by infant sex, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study included 352 full-term newborns from low-risk pregnancies and their mothers in low-income settings in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropometric data (weight, length, head circumference) and other information (feeding type, offspring sex, family income) were collected at delivery (W0), discharge (W1), and up to 8 weeks postpartum (W2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACEs were assessed using the CDC-Kaiser Questionnaire, and weight gain was calculated as the difference between W2 and W1, divided by the number of days between measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association between maternal ACEs and offspring weight gain was positive only in male offspring (unstandardized coefficient (male) = 1.82, SE = 0.438, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001); for each 1-point increase in the ACEs score (e.g., from 0 to 1), weight gain increased by 1.8 g/day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that maternal ACEs are associated with increased weight gain in male infants during the first two months of life, potentially increasing the risk of future obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is required to investigate the underlying biological mechanisms and their neurodevelopmental implications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE52OHJJdnNhanpubnRYeTI3M3FmaXhQdFZ6RHRTSGlsUUx5aENzTE9peHVJX2JENnVLVVNzVW40N29uUWtQVTNrQU1SaC1fSWRCLWktLVh5Zl9rRE4xQ2tJb1VkTUFtVmZ4SzBQMFZldG1ZQQ</guid></item><item><title>免疫恢复力被确定为健康衰老和长寿的关键-神经科学新闻 | Immune Resilience Identified as Key to Healthy Aging and Longevity - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5Udkloamc1U0dxQk1zd1pXRHdYX2JYelY1ODlDMlFEWHYzd1RXSFZHdzkzdUcweFBqRFR5bFowQ0xON0hHa185OVk0Q1NvSWxaeEdySWs1RkhCMGNjSC1EOUZXbFhVamJwY1d3Z3lwVDJpRUVRMHRjaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that immune resilience, a person’s ability to maintain a robust, youthful immune system, plays a critical role in promoting long-term health and extending life. By analyzing data from over 17,000 individuals, researchers found that immune resilience, particularly involving the TCF7 gene, protects against chronic inflammation, immunosenescence, and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals in midlife with high immune resilience had a 69% lower mortality rate and a biological age advantage of up to 15 years.

After age 70, mortality rates converge between resilient and non-resilient groups, reflecting biological limits on longevity extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TNFα-blockers restore salutogenesis pathways, indicating IR delays aging-related processes rather than altering aging rates. By reframing aging as a salutogenic-pathogenic balance, we establish &lt;em&gt;TCF7&lt;/em&gt;-centered IR as central to healthy longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeted midlife interventions to enhance IR offer actionable strategies to maximize healthspan before biological constraints limit benefits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 12:13:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5Udkloamc1U0dxQk1zd1pXRHdYX2JYelY1ODlDMlFEWHYzd1RXSFZHdzkzdUcweFBqRFR5bFowQ0xON0hHa185OVk0Q1NvSWxaeEdySWs1RkhCMGNjSC1EOUZXbFhVamJwY1d3Z3lwVDJpRUVRMHRjaQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，常见药物与认知能力的微妙变化有关- PsyPost | Common medications linked to subtle shifts in cognitive performance, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPZ3hKMkVmdGVaU3FLbWk2TFJmTEc1ZU1SYnJfcnJpNFItSUJRbWhRbE1hcXJfTFdXQkZSZ1VRTk1PYld1c3oweFVjbHlBQllyNjkzWjFmbGp2aXRBZVRsc1VuTFl3U1dmczdpSEJjZzlrYk1YQUctUkF1SEFjSUJoMUliZFFtbzJlRkEyZnl5UkRWYjFUQVRKQWN2UHd0dF9jbGpWLW81WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70200" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Brain and Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that some widely used medications may have subtle but meaningful associations with cognitive performance—both positive and negative—when considered across entire populations. By analyzing data from more than half a million individuals in the United Kingdom and validating the findings in two additional cohorts, researchers developed a “cognitive footprint” framework to estimate how different medications might influence mental performance on a broad scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed in response to growing awareness that many medications can affect thinking and memory, even if cognitive function is not the drug’s intended target. Although these effects are often small, the widespread use of certain medications means that even slight impairments or improvements could add up to significant effects at the societal level. This has implications not only for public health but also for how drug trials and prescriptions are evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been exploring the concept of a cognitive footprint of individual-level and societal-level events and interventions. This is similar to the concept of a carbon footprint, which can be positive or negative and has a cumulative effect over time,” said study author Martin Rossor, a professor at the UCL Institute of Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Drug side effects are very common—particularly cognitive ones—but often not sufficiently recognized, especially for medications that do not specifically target the central nervous system. Even small effects may have significant societal impact if a medication is taken for a long time or by many people. So this was an opportunity to look at the positive and negative cognitive footprints of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers drew on three long-running population studies: the UK Biobank, which includes over 500,000 participants aged 37 to 73; the EPIC Norfolk study, with over 8,000 participants who completed cognitive testing; and the Caerphilly Prospective Study, a smaller cohort of nearly 3,000 older men. Each of these studies collected detailed data on participants’ medication use, health history, and cognitive performance. However, the cognitive tests used differed across studies, requiring sophisticated statistical methods to align the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK Biobank, researchers used a statistical approach called principal component analysis to create a summary measure of overall cognitive ability from various individual tests, including reaction time, fluid intelligence, and memory tasks. They then applied Bayesian regression models to estimate the relationship between regular use of different medications and cognitive performance, accounting for a wide range of other factors such as age, income, physical health, mood, and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that many medications had measurable associations with cognition, although the size of these effects was generally small. Among those most negatively associated were medications targeting the central nervous system, including some antiepileptics and antidepressants. For example, valproic acid, a commonly prescribed drug for seizure disorders, had one of the largest negative associations with cognitive speed. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, was also linked to reduced performance across several cognitive measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive side effects of medications are frequent and often overlooked,” Rossor told PsyPost. “Interventional trials and post-market surveillance should include structured assessments of cognition routinely, whether or not the intervention is plausibly neurotropic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, some medications showed positive associations. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, were linked to better scores on various cognitive tasks. Glucosamine, a supplement often used for joint pain, consistently showed small positive associations across all outcomes. Omega-3 fatty acids, known for their potential brain benefits, were also positively associated with several cognitive measures, particularly in the EPIC Norfolk and Caerphilly cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paracetamol, also known as acetaminophen, emerged as a drug of particular interest. It was one of the most frequently used medications and consistently showed small but negative associations with cognitive performance across the three cohorts. Because of its widespread use, this resulted in a relatively large “negative cognitive footprint” when scaled up to the population level. This means that, even though the individual impact may be minor, the overall effect across millions of users could be meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we anticipated negative effects, we were surprised that glucosamine and ibuprofen had a significant positive cognitive footprint,” Rossor said. “It’s also noteworthy that paracetamol and ibuprofen, which are often taken for similar purposes, had among the worst and best cognitive footprints observed in the study, respectively, across several cognitive domains.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To estimate the broader implications, the researchers extrapolated their findings to the general UK population aged 40 to 70. They used standardized effect sizes (Z-scores) to compare the cognitive impact of medications with other known factors, such as air pollution and aging. For instance, the positive footprint of ibuprofen on overall cognitive ability was roughly equivalent to reducing the average age of the population by two months or lowering nitrogen dioxide pollution by one microgram per cubic meter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cognitive effects were most consistent for measures of processing speed and attention, suggesting that these functions may be especially sensitive to drug-related changes. However, not all cognitive domains were equally affected, and the impact of some medications varied across different studies. For example, glucosamine showed a positive effect in the UK Biobank and EPIC Norfolk cohorts but not in the older Caerphilly sample, where it was used less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors caution that their findings are observational and do not prove that medications directly cause changes in cognitive performance. Despite using advanced statistical models to control for a wide range of potential confounding factors, such as pain or general health, it is still possible that unmeasured variables or reverse causation played a role. People who take certain medications may differ in important ways from those who do not, and some participants may have had early signs of cognitive decline before starting medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The major caveat is that association does not prove causation,” Rossor noted. “The cross-sectional nature of the study—since there was not enough data for exploring longitudinal effects—means that the relationship between medication and cognition may be difficult to interpret.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we tried to isolate the effects of medication by modeling as many other factors as possible—for example, the effects of pain on cognition in individuals taking paracetamol—these influences can never be entirely ruled out. We can only provide an upper bound of the potential effect at the population level of a medication’s cognitive footprint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study introduces a useful new tool—the cognitive footprint—for evaluating the broader effects of medications on mental performance. By incorporating both effect size and population prevalence, this approach highlights the importance of considering cognition in drug development, prescribing practices, and public health policy. It also underscores the need for more comprehensive research on the unintended cognitive effects of medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements that are widely used but rarely studied in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may benefit from applying the cognitive footprint concept to other areas, such as the impact of environmental exposures or lifestyle interventions on mental functioning. “We would like to explore the cognitive footprint of a variety of interventions and effects—such as, at an individual level, the footprint of shift work, and at a population level, the effect of heat waves,” Rossor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70200" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Cognitive Footprint of Medication Use&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Marta Suárez Pinilla, Charlotte R.

Then came the acne.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition that affects a woman's ability to regularly release an egg for fertilisation. This can result in difficulty getting pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@georgiaheins/video/7477251974262557974" data-video-id="7477251974262557974" data-embed-from="oembed"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a title="@georgiaheins" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@georgiaheins?refer=embed"&gt;@georgiaheins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;PCOS isn’t a TikTok trend. It’s losing your period, wrecking your skin, and fighting your body every day. I know - because I didn’t have any symptoms… until I went carnivore. Now, I’m not saying carnivore is bad, I’m not against it at all. Some people thrive on it and have only seen positive effects. But for me? It destroyed my hormones. I lost my period. Developed PCOS. Broke out worse than ever. And my energy? Non-existent. Truth is, women’s hormones are EVERYTHING. And extreme diets can mess with them more than you think. And the worst part? PCOS doesn’t have a cure. You don’t fix it with a detox tea, cutting carbs, or some influencer’s magic supplement. You manage it - with the right food, training, and lifestyle that actually supports your hormones. PCOS isn’t a trend. It’s not an excuse. It’s not something you self-diagnose on TikTok. It’s real. 💙&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a title="♬ original sound - Georgia Heins" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7477251991270361878?refer=embed"&gt;♬ original sound - Georgia Heins&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Georgia Heins said she didn't have any symptoms of PCOS until she went on the carnivore diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rajan explained that these symptoms can be caused by a lack of fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some people might even feel fine on a carnivore diet, but I'd argue they are in the minority', he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent data shows that some 200,000 people in the UK look for information about the carnivore diet online every month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many, including celebrities like Joe Rogan, have championed the eating plan for its fat-burning abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high-protein, low-carb diet works by putting the body into a state of ketosis - forcing it to burn fat, rather than carbohydrate, for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this too can have devastating consequences for a woman's reproductive system, experts have warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lisa Goldstein, a leading nutritionist who specialises in reproductive health, said: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When you don't eat enough - especially too few carbs - your brain can switch off ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medically known as hypothalamic amenorrhea, this is the body's way of avoiding pregnancy when energy reserves are low, she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can be caused by being on a calorie-restrictive diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unlike men, women's reproductive systems require a minimum threshold of calories, carbs and body fat to function', she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carnivore diets have also been linked to increased risk of bowel cancer, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 11:33:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我放弃了Ozempic ，接受了健康而不是追求瘦身的感觉- NPR | I quit Ozempic and embraced feeling healthy over striving for thinness - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxQX1cydFdxcjcwM1p4MnoyTTFWUERRdTJUTTMwc0hVaHAwbDFFUVJSazFROXF5YWI5VEpQS0V1N0VOVTc4WGhaRUFxWTFmdW1UMDc4U3FWUnJVb0xMR2xFYUxlUWhUbFRKRkF0WnZrMUl2TEt5em82NkZYTFNWX183RHEyQ1A0emhWNjNhWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;
      
   &lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2022, I decided to try taking Ozempic to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the time, I was an early adopter. The media frenzy about GLP1 agonists hadn't yet started. Even my own doctor was surprised at my request.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I haven't really prescribed them for weight loss much," she told me. "Have you tried Noom? Or meals from HelloFresh?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But I'm a primary care doctor, and I'd been following the scientific literature that showed GLP1 agonists could now be used specifically for weight loss. I wanted to try them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the end, I was also an early quitter: I stopped taking the drug within months of starting it. Ozempic made me nauseated, gave me heartburn, disrupted my sleep. It wasn't worth it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;I was not alone, it turns out, in finding it difficult to stick with the Ozempic. New research shows the vast majority of people who try GLP-1 agonists for weight loss end up stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while many people benefit from these medications, I think doctors can learn from the fact that so many people give up on them, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When I started thinking about giving Ozempic a try, I had given birth the year before. Like most women, I had gained weight in pregnancy. Also like most women, I thought I had to lose it all to "get healthy" again.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;My doctor's initial advice wasn't terrible – eating vegetables and regular exercise are indeed good for you — but I had heard it before. I had doled out the same recommendations to my own patients a million times, without much success.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the end, my doctor prescribed the Ozempic. When I gave myself my first injection, I was optimistic it would help me feel healthier.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Since then, I've started writing publicly about &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/04/1202723479/ozempic-body-positive-medicine-weight-stigma" target="_blank"&gt;being a size-inclusive physician&lt;/a&gt; who doesn't push my patients to lose weight. But at the time, I hadn't yet fully embraced a weight-neutral approach to caring for my patients — and caring for myself. After all, I had spent years of medical training absorbing the message that the only way to be healthy was to get down to a body mass index of 25 or below.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But my experience with Ozempic made me realize I had confused two distinct issues: Being healthy is not always the same thing as being thin.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When I tried Ozempic, I had been struggling to get back into exercise after childbirth. With a baby at home disrupting my sleep, I felt sluggish all the time. I thought the medication might help me get more energized.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Instead, I started feeling almost immediately terrible. The heartburn was the first side effect I noticed, then the nausea. At a friend's wedding that summer, I toasted the couple with a glass of champagne, then spent the entire reception vomiting in a bathroom stall. I felt too sick to exercise. It was hard to sleep because of the abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I felt, in a word, unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wasn't exactly systematic when I stopped taking it. I definitely didn't talk to my doctor about it. (Classic doctor behavior – we're the worst patients.) I just made excuses about skipping a week, and then another.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And I'm not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;My experience was not unique, new research shows. The majority of people who start GLP1 agonists end up stopping them, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;according to research published earlier this year in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study authors found that nearly 65% of study subjects who were taking the medications explicitly for weight loss, rather than diabetes control, ended up going off them within a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It wasn't clear why individual patients stopped the drugs, but researchers found some common reasons. Patients who experienced significant side effects were more likely to quit the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Patients with lower income levels were also more likely to quit, presumably because they couldn't afford them. (&lt;a href="https://whyy.org/articles/independence-blue-cross-restrict-coverage-ozempic-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;A growing number of insurers&lt;/a&gt; are no longer covering the medications, because they're so expensive, which shifts the costs directly on to patients.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who lost a significant amount of weight were another group who quit at a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Or maybe, like me, some of those quitters felt healthier when they weren't taking the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When I stopped the Ozempic, I slowly found myself feeling better. I started exercising again, taking my son in the jogging stroller and hiking with my family on the weekends. My sleep was less disrupted by an upset stomach. I allowed myself to enjoy food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I didn't lose weight, but my blood pressure and glucose levels remained normal. I felt more vibrant and alive. My mental health was better. Was it possible that I could be healthy &lt;em&gt;without &lt;/em&gt;a BMI of 25?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of my fellow doctors don't think so. "Greater efforts are needed to increase access and adherence," the &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;researchers wrote in their article about GLP-1 discontinuation rates, the assumption being that the goal of doctors everywhere should be to get patients to take the medications — and stick to them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I'm not anti-Ozempic; far from it. I prescribe GLP-1s for many of my patients, and lots of them show improvement on metrics like blood glucose, hypertension, and kidney function. Many of my patients say the drugs help them lead much healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a narrow focus on weight — which, so often, our medical training still teaches — misses the point that there's more to being well than a number on the scale. For me, I felt healthier at a higher weight because &lt;em&gt;stopping &lt;/em&gt;Ozempic helped me exercise regularly, sleep better, and feel less pain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of my patients tell me similar stories. One woman told me that having a peaceful relationship with food is more important to her than a few pounds of weight loss. Another patient told me that "being skinny isn't worth feeling sick every day."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I worry that in the age of Ozempic, we doctors have returned to a myopic obsession with weight as the definition of health. Instead of focusing on objective measures like kidney function or liver inflammation, doctors instead hone in on BMI, a metric that the American Medical Association has denounced as &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/ama-use-bmi-alone-imperfect-clinical-measure" target="_blank"&gt;not rigorous enough &lt;/a&gt;to evaluate an individual patient's health. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Just look at the hand-wringing &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819256" target="_blank"&gt;in another recent paper&lt;/a&gt; that showed high rates of people quitting GLP1s: "Discontinuation could have policy and medication coverage implications, especially if the weight reduction is not sustained after medications are discontinued," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This comes even as &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-adopts-new-policy-clarifying-role-bmi-measure-medicine" target="_blank"&gt;major medical organizations&lt;/a&gt; are putting less and less emphasis on BMI and as &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/5/339" target="_blank"&gt;new research emerges&lt;/a&gt; that shows cardiovascular fitness may be more important than body weight as a predictor of disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As I try to help my patients navigate decisions about these medications, I keep returning to the core value of bodily autonomy. Health is multidimensional and deeply personal. My patients decide what it means to be well — with or without a GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mara Gordon is a family physician in Camden, N.J., and a contributor to NPR.

The small percentage who do may initially experience a fever, headache, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms can emerge &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/vector-borne-diseases/mosquito-borne-diseases/mosquito-borne-diseases-of-concern/la-crosse-encephalitis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tn.gov/health/cedep/vector-borne-diseases/mosquito-borne-diseases/mosquito-borne-diseases-of-concern/la-crosse-encephalitis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;within three to 10 days&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of being bitten by an infected mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, especially children under 16, these symptoms can then progress to more severe disease. For instance, the virus may cause brain &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, known as encephalitis. Around 75% of the La Crosse cases that involve encephalitis occur in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fatality rate from La Crosse encephalitis is less than 1%. However, between 5% and 15% of patients who recover from this condition can go on to experience recurring seizures after the initial infection has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatments:&lt;/strong&gt; There is no cure for La Crosse virus disease, nor a vaccine that can help prevent infection.

								&lt;p&gt;You may feel that we all have enough to worry about, and thus have no need for the spectre of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/10/30/zombies-in-nature-halloween-science/" target="_blank"&gt;zombie-like reanimated bacteria&lt;/a&gt; or viruses in thawing permafrost that set off a story straight out of a sci-fi flick. Unfortunately, it's a looming reality thanks to climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, scientists tell us that while it's high time we thought carefully about how we are going to manage the vast numbers of microbes being released along with equally vast quantities of melting ice and thawing permafrost as a result of global heating, there is no need to panic nor to sensationalize the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Salon spoke with microbiologist Luis Andrés Yarzábal, an associate professor at the Universidad Católica de Cuenca in Ecuador, he was indeed careful to avoid sensationalizing the problem. But he noted that we've been aware since the '80s of dramatic quantities of microbes found in even the most pristine of Antarctic ice sheets or on top of mountains, such as the Andean glaciers, and in permafrost. The host of life on ice includes bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, even microscopic animals like nematodes, some dead and some alive in suspended animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yarzábal actually started studying the microbiology of the Andean glaciers, beginning in Venezuela 17 years ago, because he and his team were interested in the biotechnological potential of cold-loving, or psychrophile, microorganisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They can be used, for instance, for agricultural purposes, to improve agriculture in cold regions, in mountainous regions." But the country's glaciers melted, and as they did, it revealed huge numbers of pathogens in the melting ice. Some of these disease-causing bugs may be so old, human immune systems are totally naïve to them, which means unleashing them could infect millions, maybe even trigger another pandemic. The odds of such an event may be remote — we don't actually know how likely this all is — but we do know the likelihood isn't zero and it will increase as the world's ice retreats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Venezuela is now the first country in the modern world to have lost all its glaciers, and there were many, many pathogens," Yarzábal said. Some are very similar to modern human pathogens. From bioprospecting beneficial microbes, he was now forced to consider less cheery possibilities. After all, Venezuela's lost glaciers were far from the only ones releasing water that has been frozen for tens or hundreds of thousands of years. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08545-z" target="_blank"&gt;Newly published research in Nature suggests that&lt;/a&gt; between 2000 and 2023, the world's glaciers lost some 275  gigatonnes, give or take, in mass annually, with the rate of melting increasing substantially more recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disrupting the ecological equilibrium always has the potential to cause hazards to human health directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The rate at which we lost ice during these 23 years is approximately the amount of water contained in four Olympic pools, per second. So that's a lot of microbes that will disperse around the ecosystems, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems," said Yarzábal, who &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352004313_Climate_change_melting_cryosphere_and_frozen_pathogens_Should_we_worry" target="_blank"&gt;published a 2021 review with two colleagues exploring&lt;/a&gt; existing literature regarding the consequences of such a large store of microbes being steadily released back into the environment. And that's just glaciers. There are still the thawing permafrost and melting ice sheets to take into account. All of these, however unpolluted, contain their own microbial worlds. Worlds with between ten and 100 million microbes per milliliter of ice, depending on the kind of ice, Yarzábal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are talking [altogether] about an amount of microorganisms which has been estimated between 10^25 and 10^28 microorganisms enclosed, entrapped in ice prisons ... So it's a huge amount of microorganisms ... Consider that there are 10^23 stars in the universe," Yarzábal told Salon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, he said, while many of these captive microbes are dead, plenty of them are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In this group of viable microorganisms, there are some ancient ancestral pathogens, which can also reactivate ... and they can disseminate in different ecosystems and they can, of course, infect animals, plants and other microbes," Yarzábal said. Any of these could pose a problem, whether it's because we're talking about a virus that is deadly for humans, or a bacteria that infects livestock, or a type of fungus, say, that can blight plants. Disrupting the ecological equilibrium always has the potential to cause hazards to human health directly, or to risk altering or damaging the environment we depend upon or merely appreciate for its intrinsic value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is a fact," said Yarzábal. "So we can see it as a threat, and we can anticipate this problem by studying these pathogens or these microbes, by studying the ecology of glaciers and permafrost. It's a fact, so we must be prepared for what can happen."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Already we've had a warning of what could happen: in 2016, Siberia had &lt;span&gt;an extremely hot summer. The permafrost melted, exposing in the process the frozen carcasses of reindeer who had died an estimated 150 years before thanks to an epidemic of anthrax. While the animals were dead, some of the bacteria in them had remained alive, and when curious living reindeer came into contact with the remains of their frozen ancestors, they became infected with the spore-forming bacteria, &lt;em&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/em&gt;. As Yarzábal told Salon, almost 2,500 animals died and many hundreds of people (who, in this area, are in close contact with reindeer, relying on them as a source of protein for food and commerce) became infected, with at least one small human child dying as a result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt="Permafrost under the layer of soil" class="inserted_image" data-image_id="15056106" id="featured_image_img" src="https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/600/https://media2.salon.com/2025/02/permafrost_under_the_layer_of_soil_2196693440.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong class="article_img_desc insert_image"&gt;Permafrost under the layer of soil (Getty Images/Stasz D Sirotkin)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Yarzábal is at work in the Southern hemisphere, in the far North, Dr. &lt;span&gt;Emilie Andersen-Ranberg, senior veterinarian at the Department for Veterinary Clinical Sciences at the University of Copenhagen, has been studying Arctic pathogens that are zoonotic, meaning they cause illnesses that can spread between animals and humans. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not all zoonotic pathogens in the Arctic are frozen, mind you, and not all frozen pathogens in the Arctic are zoonotic. But about three quarters of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; human infectious diseases are zoonotic, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8808746/#:~:text=Although%20about%2060%25%20of%20novel,40%25%20have%20other%20origins2." target="_blank"&gt;including the majority of novel epidemics and pandemics in recent years&lt;/a&gt;, and there's overlap with the issue of thawing permafrost. In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724070268?via%3Dihub&amp;amp;__cf_chl_tk=JOFT_HErB.9yw0pWk.DTtI5Sf1yVWIWXfqdpLZQn.dE-1744945773-1.0.1.1-NUJH6yIoBmeBgX8RkqnPSbEazvn3SqtT3ylZR4HHw0c" target="_blank"&gt;a paper published in December&lt;/a&gt;, Andersen-Ranberg and a host of co-authors describe zoonotic viruses, bacteria and parasites of concern in the Arctic, arguing that "&lt;/span&gt;the Arctic represents a changing world where pollution, loss of biodiversity and habitat, and maritime activity are likely driving forward occurrence of infectious diseases", with thawing permafrost being one factor among many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How concerned should we really be about thawing zoonotic infections? In an email interview, Andersen-Ranberg told Salon that's not exactly clear.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is not necessarily grounds to fear that the viruses in the frozen environment are more pathogenic&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We simply don’t exactly know. There is, however, a clear theoretical risk since glaciers and permafrost are melting and they store millennia old microbes and some of these organisms have been found to revive and re-function after thawing," she said. "For example, a wide array of both RNA and DNA viruses have been detected in thawing permafrost and have been able to re-activate, [such as] RNA viruses that are highly similar to viruses that today infect mammals. On the other hand, we are constantly exposed to potentially pathogenic viruses from various natural sources, and there is not necessarily grounds to fear that the viruses in the frozen environment are more pathogenic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did note, however, that thawing permafrost could re-introduce ancient pathogenic viruses that are now extinct, or where today's strains have evolved to have such a different genetic makeup that our (or other mammals') immune systems are less able to detect and fight off the ancient strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such pathogens would be unknown to our immune systems, as smallpox was to the immune systems of the Indigenous people who &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2013/05/04/a_lost_plague_remembering_canadas_smallpox_epidemic_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;encountered it as a result of European colonizers&lt;/a&gt; who brought the virus to the Americas, Australasia and elsewhere, leading to mass deaths from succeeding waves of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not just the resurgence of ancient diseases, but the fact that pathogens can and will trade genetic information if they come into contact with one another, a process known as viral recombination. Bacteria are also "promiscuous," easily exchanging genetic material. This could allow them to acquire genes from frozen pathogens that confer &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/07/12/climate-change-could-return-us-to-the-pre-antibiotic-era/" target="_blank"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; or greater virulence. As it's common for hosts like humans or other animals to harbor more than one infection at once, there can be plenty of opportunities for gene transfer to occur. Therefore, infectious agents released from melting ice "represents an even greater pool of genetic viral diversity to be introduced in already circulating viral populations," Andersen-Ranberg explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This for example means more potential ways to avoid the immune system of the host, or an increased ability to infect a variety of hosts," Andersen-Ranberg added. "Moreover, this melt-induced introduction of potential pathogens occurs simultaneously with other great changes to disease dynamics worldwide currently occurring due to climate change and changing human activities. Put simply, it's a lot happening all at once." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can or should we be doing about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I don't know," Yarzábal acknowledged soberly. That is, beyond what he already recommended — we must do far more to anticipate potential disease outbreaks or reoccurrences and to understand the specific pathogens we're likely to encounter. The microbiologist is not sure what other action we might take, practically-speaking, as vast areas of ice and permafrost unleash the microorganisms they've been hanging onto all these years. Unless we reduce emissions enough to keep some of those frozen pathogens in ice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Aerial view above the glaciers melting into the permafrost of Jostedalsbreen National Park" class="inserted_image" data-image_id="15050676" id="featured_image_img" src="https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/600/https://media2.salon.com/2024/06/glacial_melt_rivers_lakes_jostedalsbreen_national_park_1784183054.jpg"&gt;&lt;strong class="article_img_desc insert_image"&gt;Aerial view above the glaciers melting into the permafrost of Jostedalsbreen National Park (Getty Images/MICHAEL WORKMAN)&lt;/strong&gt;Beyond that, this is a genie that can't be put back in its bottle, only monitored and managed as it plays its tricks. But that monitoring and containment of potential disease outbreaks will be absolutely critical to protect us. In 2019, the European Academies Science Advisory Council &lt;a href="https://easac.eu/fileadmin/PDF_s/reports_statements/Climate_Change_and_Health/EASAC_CCH_Main_Report_WEB_2August.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;issued a report&lt;/a&gt; that noted that pathogen release of infectious disease from thawing permafrost was one among various ways climate change could affect human health in Europe. And that same year, EASAC along with the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) and InterAcademy Partnership, a global network of science, engineering and medicine societies, brought researchers and public health officials together from North America, the European Union and Russia to assess the current state of knowledge and gaps in knowledge relating to the risks similarly posed by infectious agents in thawing Arctic permafrost and ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we really need much more scientific investigation to understand the degree of threat such pathogens may pose to human, animal and ecosystem health, Yarzábal said. Meanwhile, the Arctic Council, which brings together Arctic countries and Indigenous Arctic communities to share knowledge and discuss policy affecting the region, &lt;a href="https://cphpost.dk/2024-07-01/news/politics/denmark-will-chair-the-arctic-council-in-2025-what-is-it-up-against/" target="_blank"&gt;has been weakened in recent years by&lt;/a&gt; political divisions, and different nations' territorial ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To me, there is a mind-blowing gap between the knowledge and worries of scientists and the opinions and aims of decision makers, i.e. an incongruent relationship between knowledge and political realities," Andersen-Ranberg told Salon. "I find this most noteworthy, because there is such relatively little emphasis on and monitoring of zoonoses as well as emerging/reemerging disease in the Arctic — an area subjected to the greatest degree of climate change in the world which currently drastically changes disease dynamics."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ditto for the way serious cases of COVID-19 rapidly declined as the number of people who got vaccinated against the virus increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite still being the fifth leading cause of death in the United States, stroke is another example of an area we're seeing improvement.

This decrease is due, in part, to improvements in controlling major stroke risk factors such as high cholesterol and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-one-wants-high-blood-090047558.html" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant improvements are still needed, however, as someone in the country is dying of stroke &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/data-research/facts-stats/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about every three minutes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;about every three minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what a stroke is, what causes it and what treatment usually looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a stroke?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of stroke. An ischemic stroke is what happens when something blocks the arteries or reduces blood flow from the heart to the brain. This blockage deprives brain tissue of vital oxygen and nutrients, which causes brain cells to die within minutes. Sometimes called a brain attack, a hemorrhagic stroke is caused by blood vessels in the brain bursting or leaking, which increases pressure on brain cells and kills or damages them. "About 85% of strokes are ischemic and about 15% are hemorrhagic," says Dr. Lawrence Wechsler, a professor of neurology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain cells are damaged in either way, it can cause difficulty seeing out of one or both eyes, numbness in the face, legs or arms (which usually manifests more on one side of the body than the other), a sudden and&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/dealing-migraine-heres-rid-according-090305173.html" data-ylk="slk:acute headache;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt; acute headache&lt;/a&gt; or slurred speech/difficulty talking. "General confusion or difficulty understanding speech can be another sign to look out for," says Dr. Jonathon Parker, a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some strokes are more severe than others, with people experiencing only mild confusion or a drooping smile while others can lose mobility or even consciousness. "The severity depends on which part of the brain is affected and how long the brain goes without blood flow – which is why some strokes can sadly be life-threatening," explains Dr. Rosy Thachil, director of the cardiovascular intensive care unit at NYC Health + Hospitals/Elmhurst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No one wants high blood pressure. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/no-one-wants-high-blood-090047558.html" data-ylk="slk:Here's the secret to keeping it low (but not too low).;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;Here's the secret to keeping it low (but not too low).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes strokes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ischemic stroke is caused by blood vessels becoming narrowed or arteries being blocked by fatty deposits. Other forms of blockage include "plaque buildup in the arteries or &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/08/08/sugar-substitute-erythritol-blood-clots/74691702007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt; from the heart," says Wechsler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaks and ruptures associated with a hemorrhagic stroke can be the result of any number of things that include head trauma, bulges at weak spots in blood vessel walls (known as aneurysms) or uncontrolled &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/blood-pressure-may-change-age-090131900.html" data-ylk="slk:high blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these various causes are preventable or modifiable, explains Dr. John Hanna, a vascular neurologist for the Atlantic Health System in New Jersey. This is why risk factors such as &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/09/26/obesity-rate-in-america-us-chart/75367963007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, excessive drinking and limited physical activity are all recommended against. Medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/sleep-apnea-sleep-disorder-might-100017819.html" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol and high blood pressure commonly increase one's risk of stroke and are also often within a person's control to reduce or avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Atrial fibrillation, which is a specific type of &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/healthy-resting-heart-rate-experts-090021040.html" data-ylk="slk:irregular heartbeat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;irregular heartbeat&lt;/a&gt;, can be another risk factor," adds Parker; and taking certain medications is yet another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two non-avoidable factors that predispose some individuals to vascular issues like stroke are getting older and genetics/a family history of heart disease, says Thachil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is sleep apnea? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/sleep-apnea-sleep-disorder-might-100017819.html" data-ylk="slk:The sleep disorder you might have could be why you're sluggish;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;The sleep disorder you might have could be why you're sluggish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the best treatment for stroke?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's critical to get medical treatment as soon as a stroke begins to improve recovery time and diminish or avoid longer-term damage, disability or death. If you suspect a person may be having a stroke, the "F.A.S.T." warning signs can help – as recommended by the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Stroke Association.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Stroke Association.&lt;/a&gt; This acronym includes signs of stroke to look out for that include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;.  Face drooping to one side that will be obvious if you ask the person to smile and it appears uneven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;. Arm weakness or numbness that may be apparent if you ask the person to raise both arms and they can't lift one or one arm drifts downward after being raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;. Speech difficulty such as being hard to get words our or words that sound slurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;. Time to call 911 if you identify such signs, as a stroke is a medical emergency that requires immediate care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the hospital, "treatment depends on the type and severity of the stroke," says Thachil. Ischemic strokes, he explains, may be treated with clot-busting medications like tPA, or, in more severe cases, with specialized devices introduced through a catheter. "Hemorrhagic strokes require a different approach and are typically managed by neurosurgery," says Hanna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/jay-leno-undergoing-very-aggressive-213356728.html" data-ylk="slk:oxygen stabilization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;oxygen stabilization&lt;/a&gt; and treatment, blood thinning or antiplatelet medications are often prescribed to decrease the patient's risk of having another stroke. Blood pressure and cardiovascular health are also carefully monitored going forward to prevent future damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recovery approaches such as rehab, medications and/or lifestyle changes," says Thachil, "are tailored to the needs of each individual patient based on the extent of their brain injury."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/04/24/what-is-a-stroke/83165459007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What is a stroke?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What is a stroke?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:06:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5PNktXd3lDcGJ4NjZYcGZWRmZzODh2S1lLNjRDWkxtWXdiRGNmR1lueEoxc0hkZ2xFSWZGTEFPQndCUllFcW1jOWlaU2lPbkRJdFQ4R2VrSm9ZM2k4Umw2QWxWVTA5UHBvS0toS1h5VU03RXc</guid></item><item><title>随着疾病的增加，援助削减扰乱了儿童疫苗计划-路透社 | Aid cuts disrupt childhood vaccine programmes as diseases rise - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNY0tBcWVGaWVEalBXWERZVE85Uk56Rl9DMGVMOElRMjZ0bWc2S3djOTk2NTlpVmJOMmJ0NjhZZEd0T1FSOTlRNVhuYjJyMFRZNlUxNTZVMGxvM0YxYWFfUEkwcGNuaWtTS1k4ZG5LdkFyWV9aeFZ6d3NBUnR5SnRmdC1ld05kQU5XT2tMUzF5a21PNTlsX2lfNFByZm1XTHpYNFpvUWc1V09MSE5MMDZSUnh2RkY3ZHd3Y3NVN0lvWkhLdDdkVEcwVWxrckYzRHJTb3dZVmhXTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2025 07:09:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNY0tBcWVGaWVEalBXWERZVE85Uk56Rl9DMGVMOElRMjZ0bWc2S3djOTk2NTlpVmJOMmJ0NjhZZEd0T1FSOTlRNVhuYjJyMFRZNlUxNTZVMGxvM0YxYWFfUEkwcGNuaWtTS1k4ZG5LdkFyWV9aeFZ6d3NBUnR5SnRmdC1ld05kQU5XT2tMUzF5a21PNTlsX2lfNFByZm1XTHpYNFpvUWc1V09MSE5MMDZSUnh2RkY3ZHd3Y3NVN0lvWkhLdDdkVEcwVWxrckYzRHJTb3dZVmhXTQ</guid></item><item><title>年轻人的肠癌正在上升。儿童毒素暴露可能是原因-《独立报》 | Bowel cancer in young people is on the rise.

It's produced by a specific strain of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, distinct from the strains associated with infections like diarrhoea. This finding offers a new avenue for understanding and potentially addressing the concerning trend of bowel cancer in younger demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, including from the UK and backed by &lt;a href="/topic/cancer-research-uk"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, found that exposure to colibactin in early &lt;a href="/topic/childhood"&gt;childhood&lt;/a&gt; imprints a genetic signature on the DNA of bowel cells, which may then &lt;a href="/topic/increase"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; the risk of developing bowel cancer before the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2"

aged 25-49 in the UK every year and around 44,100 new cases among all ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work has been ongoing to discover why more younger people are developing bowel cancer, with experts believing poor diet, more ultra-processed foods, obesity and a lack of exercise are playing a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in the latest study, led by the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and published in the journal Nature, researchers have uncovered another possible culprit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts examined 981 colorectal (bowel) cancer genomes from patients with both early and late-onset disease in 11 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found colibactin can leave behind specific patterns of DNA mutations that are 3.3 times more common in early-onset bowel cancer cases (in the study this was adults under 40) than in those diagnosed after the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mutation patterns were also particularly common in countries with a higher rate of early-onset bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1kgrxrh-0 IuFeK"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-1kgrxrh-3 bCcmfs"&gt;Symptoms of bowel cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="sc-1kgrxrh-4 gFApdk"&gt;According to The NHS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1kgrxrh-5 iJEtqr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of bowel cancer may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;changes in your poo, such as having softer poo, diarrhoea or constipation that is not usual for you &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;needing to poo more or less often than usual for you &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;blood in your poo, which may look red or black &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bleeding from your bottom &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;often feeling like you need to poo, even if you've just been to the toilet &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;tummy pain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a lump in your tummy &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bloating &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;losing weight without trying &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;feeling very tired for no reason &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer can cause anaemia (when you have fewer red blood cells than usual), which can make you feel very tired, short of breath and have headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author, Ludmil Alexandrov, a professor at UCSD, said: “These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study first author Marcos Diaz-Gay, a former postdoctoral researcher, said: “When we started this project, we weren’t planning to focus on early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our original goal was to examine global patterns of colorectal cancer to understand why some countries have much higher rates than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But as we dug into the data, one of the most interesting and striking findings was how frequently colibactin-related mutations appeared in the early-onset cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that colibactin-related mutations account for around 15% of what are known as APC driver mutations – some of the earliest genetic alterations that directly promote cancer development – in bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they’re 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60,” Professor Alexandrov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is part of Cancer Grand Challenges team Mutographs, funded by Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now developing early detection tests that analyse stool samples for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director of Cancer Grand Challenges, Dr David Scott, said: “Globally and in the UK, we’re witnessing an alarming increase in some types of cancer in people under the age of 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is unlikely that there will be one clear driver but Cancer Grand Challenges scientists are racing to solve this puzzle, and our Mutographs team has uncovered a surprising clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many early-onset colorectal cancer patients appear to have been exposed to a toxin, called colibactin, produced by some strains of the bacteria E. coli in early life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s unclear how the exposure originates, but we suspect that a combination of factors – including diet – may intersect during a crucial phase in the development of the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study adds an important piece to the puzzle of early-onset cancers, but it isn’t conclusive, and more research will be needed to establish a definitive link between colibactin and an increased risk of early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other Cancer Grand Challenges teams, like Optimisticc and Prospect, are looking deeper into the microbiome and other environmental factors to uncover what’s behind the global rise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr

class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-69eaed10-207d-11f0-b31c-6f6c22fda53e"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, Irvine created lab-grown immune cells that can track down toxic brain buildup and clear it away, restoring memory and brain function in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They did this by turning&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14583499/dire-wolf-species-deextinction-animals-revived.html"&gt; stem cells — which can become any cell in the body —&lt;/a&gt; into brain immune cells called microglia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The edited cells were able to clear the junk without harming healthy tissue, leading to reduced inflammation and a dramatic improvement in brain performance in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment could mark the start of a whole &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14485993/Urgent-warning-common-sexual-act-lead-DEMENTIA.html"&gt;new approach to neurodegenerative disease &lt;/a&gt;— with potential applications for brain &lt;a

class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 7 million Americans are living with &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-801f6f70-207d-11f0-b31c-6f6c22fda53e"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; today, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Current treatments can only slow symptoms — not reverse them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Human trials are still several years off, but the early results have scientists buzzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the therapy works in people like it did in mice, it could rewrite the future of brain health, the team said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers developed this new therapy by turning stem cells into immune cells called microglia (pictured) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results suggest that the researchers have overcome one of the biggest hurdles to treating degenerative brain diseases: getting medicine past the blood-brain barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This protective layer of cells lines the inner surfaces of the blood vessels inside the brain and functions as a sort of gateway, keeping harmful substances out and keep helpful ones in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traditional cell-based treatments have failed to bypass this barrier, but the microglia don't have to because they are already present inside the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've developed a programmable, living delivery system that gets around that problem by residing in the brain itself and responding only when and where it's needed,' said co-author and professor of neurobiology Mathew Blurton-Jones in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/04/21/engineered-microglia-show-promise-for-treating-alzheimers-other-brain-diseases/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typical microglia both help and hurt the progression of Alzheimer's disease. When plaque begins to build up in the brain, they spring into action, releasing enzymes to break it down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But over time, they begin to run amok, triggering inflammation and damaging neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blurton-Jones and his colleagues found a way to create microglia that treat brain damage without making it worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, they grew human microglia from stem cells, then used CRISPR gene editing — a technique that allows scientists to make precise changes to a cell's DNA — to reprogram the way they function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The modified microglia reduced brain plaques (pictured in orange) without damaging neurons and synapses (pictured in green)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plaques disrupt normal brain function by interfering with cell signaling, thus driving cognitive decline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The modified microglia secrete neprilysin, an enzyme that breaks down brain plaque, only when they are actually near a plaque. This prevents them from accidentally  harming critical, healthy parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plaques disrupt normal brain function by interfering with cell signaling, thus driving cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because the therapeutic protein was only produced in response to amyloid plaques, this approach was highly targeted yet broadly effective,' said lead-author Jean Paul Chadarevian, a postdoctoral researcher in the Blurton-Jones' lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This work opens the door to a completely new class of brain therapies,' said Robert Spitale, co-author and professor of pharmaceutical sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Instead of using synthetic drugs or viral vectors, we're enlisting the brain's immune cells as precision delivery vehicles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This new therapy could give hope to Alzheimer's patients and their families, but it will have to go through multiple rounds of rigorous testing before it can be used to treat humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted that there is still a lot of work to be done to translate their microglial-based therapy into human trials, including demonstrating long-term safety and charting a path toward scalable manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that latter hurdle could be addressed by producing microglia from the patient's own stem cells, which would also reduce the risk of the immune system rejecting them, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This has been done to treat other types of diseases, such as blood cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, it can take about three to five years for a treatment that's successful in mice to go to human trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Apple’s weather app, too, showed that the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/air-quality-index.html" title=""&gt;Air Quality Index&lt;/a&gt; had climbed into the 400s, a reading so hazardous that people are encouraged to stay indoors. (The Air Quality Index, which ranges from 0 to 500, is a measure of the density of five pollutants in the air: &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/ground-level-ozone-basics#effects" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ground-level ozone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;particulates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/co-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;carbon monoxide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;nitrogen dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.epa.gov/so2-pollution" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To put that in perspective, that’s as high as the levels reached in 2023 when smoke from wildfires in Canada blanketed much of the East Coast and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/07/nyregion/nyc-wildfire-smoke-scenes.html" title=""&gt;turned the sky in New York City orange&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At those levels, people are advised to stay indoors, and Madeline Blair, 24, did just that. She checked her Apple weather app when she woke up and, seeing unhealthy air quality levels, skipped her morning walk.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST. LOUIS — Missouri's first measles case was confirmed last week. A child tested positive in Taney County after international travel. There have been no cases reported in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately we don't have any treatment for measles," reports SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Pediatric Infectious Disease Physician Dr. Zacharoula Oikonomopoulou, "Its attack rate is close to 90% and this is more than flu and COVID-19."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Oikonomopoulou says most people don't realize they or someone in their household has measles, "It's going to present initially with cough that is usually dry, runny nose and watery red eyes." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial symptoms of measles are generic. Dr. Oikonomopoulou says the tell-tale rash develops within three to five days, "(a) rash that is going to start from your head all the way to the bottom, accompanied by a very high fever up to 105 degrees Fahrenheit."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sneaky start of measles is a likely contributor to its recent spread in the U.S. "It is important to know that you are contagious four days before to four days after the development of that rash," explains Dr. Oikonomopoulou. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, three children have died in the United States. "Before these deaths were reported in 2025 and we have two confirmed deaths right now and one that likely was linked to measles, the most recent death was back in 2015," reports Dr. Oikonomopoulou.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Oikonomopoulou says measles is preventable, "The most effective way is to be vaccinated with two doses. If you don't know your vaccination status I would urge you to check your records or talk to your healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

(WPDE) — &lt;/span&gt;About a dozen neighbors who live on Doe Trail in Dillon County believe the material on the road is making them sick with major breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"This stuff is hazardous  to us. We breathe this stuff. And everybody in the community. In this area. Chronic breathing problems. Everybody is sick to death. We can’t keep breathing this. If we continue to keep breathing this stuff. We all gonna be dead back here," said Erika Nelson. "It feels like it’s sticking to your lungs. And you can’t breathe. So, we just go in the house until he comes down. It’s a coincidence that everybody’s got this. I can’t say that this is causing it or not. Because I’m not in the medical field. But, it’s mighty strange, since they put that on the road, everybody starting to have health problems with breathing and stuff," said JoJo Hunt.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighbors said the material on the road was a cheaper alternative to paving it, but they feel as if they're paying a price when it comes to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do take two breathing twice a day. And I do try to stay out of this dust. But, when you drive on this road, the dust flies up. In your house. You can’t even leave your doors open. I went to open my refrigerator to clean it up and I had dust, this here dust,  inside the refrigerator. It be all over your floors. And we need something done," said Deb Dula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can be laying down at night . And in the middle of the night, you've got to get up. And run outside to get air. Because you can't breathe in your own house," said Anthony Parsley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erika Nelson said she's started a petition to have the material removed altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODAY: &lt;a href="https://wpde.com/news/local/construction-site-robeson-county-arrests-theft-stolen-goods-fairmont" target="_blank" title="https://wpde.com/news/local/construction-site-robeson-county-arrests-theft-stolen-goods-fairmont" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Construction site theft leads to meth arrest in Robeson Co.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that nearly everyone she's talked with who has signed the petition has complained that the dust from the material has impacted their breathing and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm a witness because I do it every night. Coughing up mucus and stuff. And coughing real bad. Sometimes I’ll be thinking I may have to go to the hospital. Because I can’t hardly breathe at night. Got to sleep on my stomach to get to breathing right. Ride down this road and see all the dust clouds that come up in the air. It’s not good for our breathing. And for our health. Dust, it gets all in your house. All in your vehicle. All under your tires. Your car be purely white. White, like snow," said Nelson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt said he spent more than $300 to have the material tested at a state-certified laboratory in Florence, and that company sent the sample off for further testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunt shared the results of the laboratory of the results with ABC 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the sample taken from Doe Trail show a "mixture of composed primarily of calcium carbonate in the form of calcite and limestone and silicon dioxide in the form of quartz."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also said other minerals, composed of calcium sulfate and aluminum oxide, were also detected in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a laboratory report, the minerals detected in the powder is consistent with those typically found in powdered cement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillon County Administrator Tim Harper said they put down a Marine-grade limestone-based course on Doe Trail in October of 2020 because it was a cheaper option than  paving it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper said  it's been approved by the S.C. Department of Transportation (SCDOT) and they've placed it on 42 roads in the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added they've received complaints from neighbors on Doe Trail and in response, they're working with the Dillon County Transportation Committee (CTC) and checking with other counties to see what they've done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper added they'll be scheduled in May to apply a calcium chloride solution to the road to help cut down on all the dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He shared information with ABC 15 from a website on calcium chloride to help with dust control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information says calcium chloride is one of the most "effective dust control and dust suppression agents in the industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighbors are hoping that it will work because they said they can hardly walk in their yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Hunt said he's not taking any chances and may not be around to see if the solution works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bad enough that I’m fixing to put this place up for sale and get out of here,” said Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPDE</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 23:19:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxOb0hKeDRvVGFuVE9IVXQ3dkkzLTZuLThLcEF2OVlNTjlfZzJudjVlSjRlSlYzcjZWSjBWQmJvUnNlbU9VVmprNVNuUTV5UURyMVM2RFNYSVd2R0xRRG15emxjcElrTkV4OWkxRzlSOG1sYi1VcGdPdGM0RzJRMjh0U25POExZWHJXVU9kNkJrRTdOM3FRNU1HOGgxcWJpRFZvUGlUeDNZSnROd1N4ZFREQkxNLWoxMG9HaldYTDc2Uy1rbUN6Rl9vcmZwOEJ2U3A5dUZhTQ</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织、联合国儿童基金会、全球疫苗和免疫联盟-世界卫生组织（世卫组织）警告，疫苗可预防疾病暴发的增加威胁到多年的进展 | Increases in vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks threaten years of progress, warn WHO, UNICEF, Gavi - World Health Organization (WHO)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2gFBVV95cUxPUlA4OFJCNTc3TUdHTnlydzBIaWJJLVI4YnlyT2tGZUotWV96c0VvODZZT0hUOGROYzA0R0pwUGRDaXp0aWVGbWl5azNYRHdVZ0dHSXlrbjlBVGQ4NVBDR1NmQWxIdi05QVZhT19jV3RHWUpqemt4RV83Mk1CTmtWSmgzOEZJXzBhc25pSGsyTy1ZbmRyTTRtZVcyVWI1dHF5NTFoVXVOZFZac1A3eEhKR0tTYlJYTGdDOFFfU3pUNmZxdDlQazdWeEFxcDlzTlN0czFILUhGRmxSZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunization efforts are under growing threat as misinformation, population growth, humanitarian crises and funding cuts jeopardize progress and leave millions of children, adolescents and adults at risk, warn WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi during World Immunization Week, 24–30 April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, meningitis and yellow fever are rising globally, and diseases like diphtheria, that have long been held at bay or virtually disappeared in many countries, are at risk of re-emerging. In response, the agencies are calling for urgent and sustained political attention and investment to strengthen immunization programmes and protect significant progress achieved in reducing child mortality over the past 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the past five decades,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Funding cuts to global health have put these hard-won gains in jeopardy. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases are increasing around the world, putting lives at risk and exposing countries to increased costs in treating diseases and responding to outbreaks. Countries with limited resources must invest in the highest-impact interventions – and that includes vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rising outbreaks and strained health systems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is making an especially dangerous comeback. The number of cases has been increasing year on year since 2021, tracking the reductions in immunization coverage that occurred during and since the COVID-19 pandemic in many communities. Measles cases reached an estimated 10.3 million in 2023, a 20% increase compared to 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agencies warn that this upward trend likely continued into 2024 and 2025, as outbreaks have intensified around the world. In the past 12 months, 138 countries have reported measles cases, with 61 experiencing large or disruptive outbreaks – the highest number observed in any 12-month period since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningitis cases in Africa also rose sharply in 2024, and the upward trend has continued into 2025. In the first three months of this year alone, more than 5500 suspected cases and nearly 300 deaths were reported in 22 countries. This follows approximately 26 000 cases and almost 1400 deaths across 24 countries last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow fever cases in the African region are also climbing, with 124 confirmed cases reported in 12 countries in 2024. This comes after dramatic declines in the disease over the past decade, thanks to global vaccine stockpiles and use of yellow fever vaccine in routine immunization programmes. In the WHO Region of the Americas, yellow fever outbreaks have been confirmed since the beginning of this year, with a total of 131 cases in 4 countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These outbreaks come amidst global funding cuts. A recent &lt;a href="/publications/m/item/the-impact-of-suspensions-and-reductions-in-health-official-development-assistance-on-health-systems"&gt;WHO rapid stock take&lt;/a&gt; with 108 country offices of WHO – mostly in low- and lower-middle-income countries – shows that nearly half of those countries are facing moderate to severe disruptions to vaccination campaigns, routine immunization and access to supplies due to reduced donor funding. Disease surveillance, including for vaccine-preventable diseases, is also impacted in more than half of the countries surveyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the number of children missing routine vaccinations has been increasing in recent years, even as countries make efforts to catch up children missed during the pandemic. In 2023, an estimated 14.5 million children missed all of their routine vaccine doses – up from 13.9 million in 2022 and 12.9 million in 2019. Over half of these children live in countries facing conflict, fragility, or instability, where access to basic health services is often disrupted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The global funding crisis is severely limiting our ability to vaccinate over 15 million vulnerable children in fragile and conflict-affected countries against measles,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “Immunization services, disease surveillance, and the outbreak response in nearly 50 countries are already being disrupted – with setbacks at a similar level to what we saw during COVID-19. We cannot afford to lose ground in the fight against preventable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continued investment in the ‘Big Catch-Up initiative’, launched in 2023 to reach children who missed vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, and other routine immunization programmes will be critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How immunization addresses these challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint efforts by WHO, UNICEF, Gavi and partners have helped countries expand access to vaccines and strengthen immunization systems through primary health care, even in the face of mounting challenges. Every year, vaccines save nearly 4.2 million lives against 14 diseases – with nearly half of these lives saved in the African Region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination campaigns have led to the elimination of meningitis A in Africa’s meningitis belt, while a new vaccine that protects against five strains of meningitis holds promise for broader protection, with efforts underway to expand its use for outbreak response and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress has also been made in reducing yellow fever cases and deaths through increasing routine immunization coverage and emergency vaccine stockpiles, but recent outbreaks in Africa and in the Region of the Americas highlight the risks in areas with no reported cases in the past, low routine vaccination coverage and gaps in preventive campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the past two years have seen substantial progress in other areas of immunization. In the African Region, which has the highest cervical cancer burden in the world, HPV vaccine coverage nearly doubled between 2020 and 2023 from 21% to 40%, reflecting a concerted global effort towards &lt;a href="/initiatives/cervical-cancer-elimination-initiative"&gt;eliminating cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The progress in immunization also includes increases in global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, particularly in the South-East Asia Region, alongside introductions in Chad and Somalia, countries with high disease burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another milestone is the sub-national introduction of malaria vaccines in nearly 20 African countries, laying the foundation to save half a million additional lives by 2035 as more countries adopt the vaccines and scale-up accelerates as part of the tools to fight malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Call to action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNICEF, WHO, and Gavi urgently call for parents, the public, and politicians to strengthen support for immunization. The agencies emphasize the need for sustained investment in vaccines and immunization programmes and urge countries to honour their commitments to the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA2030).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of integrated primary health-care systems, vaccination can protect against diseases and connect families to other essential care, such as antenatal care, nutrition or malaria screening. Immunization is a ‘best buy’ in health with a return on investment of $54 for every dollar invested and provides a foundation for future prosperity and health security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Increasing outbreaks of highly infectious diseases are a concern for the whole world. The good news is we can fight back, and Gavi’s next strategic period has a clear plan to bolster our defences by expanding investments in global vaccine stockpiles and rolling out targeted preventive vaccination in countries most impacted by meningitis, yellow fever and measles,” said Dr Sania Nishtar, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “These vital activities, however, will be at risk if Gavi is not fully funded for the next five years and we call on our donors to support our mission in the interests of keeping everyone, everywhere, safer from preventable diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavi’s upcoming high-level pledging summit taking place on 25 June 2025 seeks to raise at least US$ 9 billion from our donors to fund our ambitious strategy to protect 500 million children, saving at least 8 million lives from 2026–2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#####&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes to editor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download multimedia content here: &lt;a href="https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4086M4S1G" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;https://weshare.unicef.org/Package/2AM4086M4S1G&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About WHO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dedicated to the health and well-being of all people and guided by science, the World Health Organization leads and champions global efforts to give everyone, everywhere, an equal chance at a safe and healthy life. We are the UN agency for health. We connect nations, partners and people on the front lines in 150+ locations – leading the world’s response to health emergencies, preventing disease, addressing the root causes of health issues and expanding access to medicines and health care. Our mission is to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/home" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;www.who.int&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About UNICEF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;UNICEF works in some of the world's toughest places, to reach the world's most disadvantaged children. Across more than 190 countries and territories, we work for every child, everywhere, to build a better world for everyone.

Since its inception in 2000, Gavi has helped to immunize a whole generation – over 1.1 billion children – and prevented more than 18.8 million future deaths, helping to halve child mortality in 78 lower income countries. Gavi also plays a key role in improving global health security by supporting health systems as well as funding global stockpiles for Ebola, cholera, meningococcal and yellow fever vaccines. After two decades of progress, Gavi is now focused on protecting the next generation, above all the zero-dose children who have not received even a single vaccine shot. The Vaccine Alliance employs innovative finance and the latest technology – from drones to biometrics – to save lives, prevent outbreaks before they can spread and help countries on the road to self-sufficiency.

Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/food-allergy/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day "on high alert hoping nothing bad happens". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite being "really nervous", Chris agreed to sign up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;From milligrams to whole nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;In the trial, patients were started on tiny amounts of peanut powder to slowly build up their tolerance&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt.

So it provides them with some protection against that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-64987074" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;in children&lt;/a&gt; whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away," says Prof Till.

"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;'Wonderful feeling'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step," explains Prof Till. "But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay – as recommended by his doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into "nuclear meltdown" has changed his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's a wonderful feeling," Chris says.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists gradually introduced 21 severely allergic adults to peanut products and peanuts in increasing amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the trial, 14 of them were able to tolerate a whole handful of peanuts without an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradual exposure to allergens – otherwise known as oral immunotherapy – has been successful in previous trials on children and babies, but this is the first time it has been tested on adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Investigator &lt;a href="https://www.allergylondon.com/team/professor-stephen-till/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof Stephen Till&lt;/a&gt;, an adult allergy expert at King’s College London, said in a statement that his team was “very pleased with the results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Constant fear of life-threatening reactions places a huge burden on people with peanut allergy,” he said. “The only way to manage a peanut allergy is strict avoidance and treatment of allergic reactions, including with adrenaline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peanut allergies affect approximately 2 per cent of the general population of Western countries, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8247890/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems to be becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till said that this trial provided “preliminary evidence” that adults with severe allergies could be desensitised, and that this would improve their quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants in this study were 18- to 40-year-olds who had been diagnosed with severe peanut allergy at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started out by trying tiny amounts of peanut flour mixed with food under strict supervision. The first dose was 0.8 mg – equivalent to less than 0.3 per cent of a whole peanut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that was well tolerated, participants would try 1.5 mg half an hour later. If that went well, they would try 3 mg half an hour after that: 1 per cent of a peanut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who were able to eat either 1.5 or 3 mg continued to eat that amount every day for two weeks. After that, they returned to the clinic and were supervised while trying higher doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, the participants would take their dose of peanut flour. Every two weeks, it would be increased slightly – until they were able to tolerate 50 mg to 1 g of peanut protein: the equivalent of two to four whole peanuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they reached that level, the participants switched to real peanuts, peanut butter or peanut products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris, 28, who took part in the study, said: “All of my life, I had associated the taste and smell of peanuts with fear and death. I started with a small amount of peanut flour with yoghurt, and by the end of the trial, I could eat four peanuts in one sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris now eats four peanuts every day with breakfast to maintain his immunity. He added: “Before, a tiny mistake could have life-threatening impacts, but now I don’t have the fear that I might collapse and die from eating a takeaway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.allergylondon.com/team/professor-adam-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof Adam Fox&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the National Allergy Study Group and professor of paediatric allergy at King’s College London, said that, while small, this study was an “important proof of principle” that exposure may help treat allergies in adults. Fox was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he warned: “This treatment requires careful medical supervision and should never be attempted without this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/13989995" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Allergy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        Your child may fear the monster under their bed. They'd be smarter to fear the air around it, or so suggests a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00051"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/child-mattress-bedding-toxins-wellness/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; reports researchers who analyzed the air in the bedrooms of 25 kids between the ages of 6 months and 4 years found "worrisome" levels of more than two dozen phthalates, flame retardants, and UV filters—particularly near the bed. To determine why, they launched a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.5c03560"&gt;companion study&lt;/a&gt; in which they evaluated 16 new lower-cost children's mattresses to determine whether they were off-gassing the chemicals. The did indeed find them to be a source of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). The &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/21/children-mattresses-toxic-chemicals-research"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; explains that semi-volatile means "they can lift off objects and seep into the air over time."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        They then tested and confirmed an additional hypothesis: that children's body heat and weight, which is a realistic scenario, would increase emissions and hence exposures." That's "a factor that current safety standards don't consider," said Jane Houlihan, research director for Healthy Babies, Bright Futures, who was not part of the study. The researchers also noted that children's exposure to SVOCs and other environmental contaminants exceeds that of adults due to "their 10-times higher inhalation rate, 3-times larger skin surface area per body weight compared to adults, and their unique behaviors such as frequent hand-to-mouth contact and mouthing objects."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        "We were really shocked to find what was in the mattresses," co-author Miriam Diamond of the University of Toronto tells the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, which notes one mattress's weight was 3% flame retardant. Phthalates and flame retardants are types chemicals whose compounds have been linked to everything from cancer and hormonal disruption to lower IQs. Phthalates are generally used as plasticizers to facilitate bending and get added to plastic mattress covers, but Diamond said researchers were surprised to find them in non-plastic covers as well.

                                        As for what concerned parents can do, the chief scientific officer at the Food Packaging Forum explains her choices to CNN: "We opted for large brands that I knew had at least some chemicals policies, and tried to get natural materials—latex, cotton, merino—or buy second hand, because I figured that most chemicals that would gas out will already have gassed out."

&lt;p&gt;What's more, according to &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/5/24-1608_article#suggestedcitation"&gt;a newly published study in Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, even if you have somehow feasted on fox feces and acquired this nightmare parasite, it's looking less likely that doctors will need to hack out chunks of your organs to try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the good news from the new study. The bad news is that, while this infection is fairly rare, it appears to be increasing. And, if you do get it, you might have a shorter lifespan than the uninfected and may be sicker in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meet the fox tapeworm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study is a retrospective one, in which a group of doctors in Switzerland examined medical records of 334 patients who developed the disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE) over a 50-year span (1973–2022). AE is an understudied, life-threatening infection caused by the fox tapeworm, &lt;em&gt;Echinococcus multilocularis&lt;/em&gt;. The parasite is not common, but can be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, particularly regions of China and Russia, and countries in continental Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/echinococcosis/index.html"&gt;In the parasite's intended lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;, adult intestinal worms release eggs into the feces of their primary host—foxes, or sometimes coyotes, dogs, or other canids. The eggs then get ingested by an intermediate host, such as voles. There, eggs develop into a spherical embryo with six hooks that pierce through the intestinal wall to migrate to the animal's organs, primarily the liver. Once nestled into an organ, the parasites develop into multi-chambered, thin-walled cysts—a proliferative life stage that lasts indefinitely. As more cysts develop, the mass&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/echinococcosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt; looks and acts like cancer&lt;/a&gt;, forming necrotic cavities and sometimes metastasizing to other organs, such as the lungs and brain. The parasite remains in these cancerous-like masses, waiting for a fox to eat the cyst-riddled organs of its host. Back in a fox, the worms attach to the intestines and grow into adults.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Parents on Wednesday were notified of a whooping cough case at a Wake County school.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the Wake County Public School System, Leesville Road High School sent a letter to parents stating the county had confirmed a case of pertussis, known as whooping cough, among one of its students.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Whooping cough is a respiratory infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by intense coughing fits that can end with a “whooping” sound when someone exhales.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms can include a runny nose, low fever, coughing that gets worse over time an apnea.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/whooping-cough-wake-county-school-march-2025/"&gt;the county detected whooping cough in a student at Oberlin Middle School&lt;/a&gt;. The Department of Health and Human Services said there were 106 cases of whooping cough in the first three months of 2025, which they say is a 106% increase from the same time period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state added that they are seeing whooping cough infections across all age groups, with the highest frequency among school-aged children and the highest rate among infants. While anyone can catch whooping cough, it can be dangerous among babies and children.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state also said only 49% of the cases have been up to date on their vaccinations, which doctors is the best but not perfect way to prevent whooping cough infections.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/whooping-cough-leesville-road-high-school-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Doctors also say it’s best to treat whooping cough with antibiotics as soon as possible so it won’t become more serious and prevent the spread of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The CDC provided the following suggestions for managing the illness at home while you’re child is recovering:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take antibiotics exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your home free from things that cause coughing like:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smoke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chemical fumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a clean, cool mist humidifier to loosen mucus and soothe the cough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat small meals every few hours to help prevent vomiting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get plenty of fluids, including water, juices, and fruits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/drive.google.com/file/d/1kA-EBWKlOQ1RuARHzUiXyNrXnWI7up3Q/view?usp=drive_link__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!HtDs-QvGX-K_0ZOJz1GnBjXBZ-k1VsOcHxBxnQu0jYLJOIs1Xj--BQmu5RaCtU3RzXsNkuWqMMY$"&gt;Wake County Health Services also sent a letter to families&lt;/a&gt; for any further questions on whooping cough. In the letter Leesville Road High School sent to parents, the school said it is taking every measure to ensure the health and safety of its students.&lt;/p&gt;

They may also contribute to the accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins - two substances strongly linked to &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-298d6050-207c-11f0-9351-af23485eec1b"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, high triglyceride levels have actually been associated with a lower risk of dementia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said their findings were sobering, given the prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been increasing in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions in which someone has three or more of five characteristics, including high triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood), high blood pressure or high blood sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the incidence of early-onset dementia among people with metabolic syndrome (pick line) and without (black line)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An exact number for metabolic syndrome diagnoses isn't known, but a 2020 &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2767313"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in JAMA found about 37 percent of US adults were estimated to have metabolic syndrome in 2016, compared to 32 percent in 2011 - the most recent comparable figures available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the same time, 640,000 Americans have early-onset dementia, a number that is also rising.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And overall cases of the disease are also increasing. There were 514,000 new cases of dementia among Americans in 2020, but that will rise to 730,000 in 2030 and 1.03million in 2060.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers from Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in Anyang, South Korea, reviewed health insurance data from 2million people between 40 and 60 years old. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They analyzed records from doctors appointments that included waist circumference, blood pressure, blood sugar and triglyceride and cholesterol levels. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of those included in the study, published in the journal Neurology, 25 percent had metabolic syndrome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a follow-up period of eight years, nearly 9,000 people - 0.45 percent - developed some form of dementia before the age of 65. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data revealed women with metabolic syndrome were at a higher risk of early-onset dementia - 34 percent - compared to men - 15 percent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, people in their 40s were more at risk than people in their 50s. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently nearly 8million Americans currently have some form of dementia and there are around 500,000 new cases diagnosed per year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common form - with 7million diagnoses - but as the aging population of the US continues to grow, so will diagnoses. By 2050, the number of Alzheimer's patients is projected to rise to nearly 13 million.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Estimates for the growth previously projected the number of Alzheimer's patients to rise to nearly 13million by 2050 (illustrated above), but NYU's new research has far higher predictions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the main cause of the dementia is still debated, scientists believe the disease is likely to be the result of an abnormal build-up of proteins - amyloid and tau - in and around brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Alzheimer's patients, amyloid proteins are not effectively cleared from the body and eventually form plaques in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, tau proteins detach from neurons and form tangles, causing neurons to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When neurons die, messages can't be delivered as effectively throughout the brain, which scientists believe is what causes the thinking difficulties in dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetics also play a strong role in the risk of Alzheimer's and in 2022 researchers identified 31 new genes that appear to affect processes that play a role in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for dementia - only medications and therapies to control symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To ward off metabolic syndrome, the researchers said people should follow a healthy diet, exercise regularly, maintain a healthy weight, quit smoking and reduce stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while this study has begun to look at the relationship between metabolic syndrome and early dementia, study author Dr Minwoo Lee said more needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Future research that follows people over longer periods of time and uses brain scans to look for biomarkers of dementia is needed to confirm and expand upon our findings.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 20:07:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPalJnYTRISm9sWmI5WklRZnoxbG5fRHJHZ0NDWkdScWEtc2hPTUN1aTQzSDZ4V3RUVWw2X1lIREVvdDVTcVRfS3JGQ1k1UjFfMVV0X09lWWJZbTVGU1pDejIybC1zVW55YjF1Uy02QUg3aTQwaWxVcV9mMUs2MkpzVTN6WjJSWFdZMURSRzhQSmtJQUZtQ3V5cWhSaGFCNmvSAaQBQVVfeXFMTThFZzdZeUhZbDdxbDhnV01pZFdUVjhvT2ZiSXF6YzdlNGcwTmxsYmFsODRjbGg1MHJITWRsMTZaZEpRbW8xTk02UGdtVVBQQnpUbEE5N1hUZXFTOEZTMWJXd1QtenNkTzFaMXRQbXlwVEFXc3NFX3huaTRnbU9UVnJwZmFRc2pNTE94bzF0YVNuWnN4bVlNOGxwVEltUFRud0JYYmQ</guid></item><item><title>融化的北极冰可能释放古老的致命疾病，科学家警告-SciTechDaily | Melting Arctic Ice May Unleash Ancient Deadly Diseases, Scientists Warn -

He was not involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“People of all ages –– from the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s and beyond –– should be empowered to make brain-healthy choices early on,” Isaacson said. “I think this study gives us more evidence to suggest that these brain-healthy choices may lead to better brain outcomes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Causation vs. correlation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It is important to note that the study was observational, which means that researchers can’t say that metabolic syndrome caused dementia, only that there was a correlation between the two, Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I don’t really think that vascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome causes Alzheimer’s disease, but I think it can fast-forward someone towards it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More research will need to be done to determine whether treating metabolic syndrome actually delays the onset of dementia or reduces the number of cases, Isaacson said. Researchers will also need to look into more populations to see if the results from South Korea can be broadly applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the latest study does give hope that there are actions people can take to combat young-onset dementia, he said. “Some people say young onset-dementia, you can’t do anything about that –– it’s preordained, but I don’t agree with that. These lifestyle factors are nontrivial,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lee believes people can influence their odds. “My advice is to proactively manage metabolic health by maintaining a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and routine medical check-ups,” he said. “Addressing metabolic syndrome early can substantially reduce the risk of dementia later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;The connection between vascular and brain health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The conditions that make up metabolic syndrome may not seem immediately connected to dementia risk, but there are a few ways that vascular health can impact cognitive decline, Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Metabolic syndrome can lead to inflammation, and “when someone has inflammation in the body and in the brain, it can fast-forward aging,” Isaacson said. “And when you have inflammation in the brain, things don’t work as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Your blood vessels working efficiently is also important to cognitive health to keep enough oxygen flowing to the brain, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And finally, he noted that metabolic syndrome may affect the brain’s ability to metabolize energy, which may lead to cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The different conditions that make up metabolic syndrome tend to happen together because they have similar causes and impact one another, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When a person is physically inactive and has an unhealthy diet … and someone is not sleeping and just kind of burning the candle at both ends … poor activity, low exercise: These are the medical or clinical manifestations of that sort of thing,” Isaacson said. “That’s why these risk factors often flock together — because they really are interrelated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;People can take steps to get healthy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute to dementia cases, some people can do everything their doctor suggests and still get dementia, Isaacson said. But making healthy lifestyle changes and addressing metabolic syndrome may still prevent or delay dementia in many people, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Treatment for metabolic syndrome, which can also increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, starts with lifestyle changes, said Dr. Pam Taub, a preventive cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego. She was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In general, the lifestyle recommendations that we recommend are really having a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/health/mediterranean-diet-recipes-wellness/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, a diet that is balanced in terms of proteins, carbohydrates, and fiber, and also limiting the amount of calorie intake,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of Taub’s research into metabolic syndrome shows that time-restricted eating can help manage the conditions, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Maintaining regular physical activity is key, though the amount and the proportion of strength, cardio and flexibility training may be specific to you and discussed with your doctor, she said. Getting enough sleep and handling stress are also essential in managing almost every chronic condition, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Of course, we can’t control the stress that’s thrown at us, but it’s how we modulate our response that is important,” Taub said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But lifestyle changes alone may not solve the problem completely, she said. Your doctor may recommend medications to help with blood pressure, blood sugar, insulin resistance, lipid lowering and weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s really not one or the other,” Taub said. “You have to synergize both lifestyle and pharmacology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 20:00:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPUURQbWlqbFFXRDdPV3pxVzBkLWladnkxaVBwMV9WdXp1bHMxMWR1Z3I0WVZraTFpa1QtamY2LTE0eFlSdFNjYnVYWFNoN3NkbW5adFZkVjgzS0dvellDYkY1NzV0UFBzNUtWTERpcUJhTzVVUjBleHEwYUJfbXN6YnFnTHUyd1Bu</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，代谢综合征是早期痴呆症的一大风险因素，您所做的事情会有所不同- CNN | Metabolic syndrome is a big risk factor for early dementia, and what you do makes a difference, study suggests - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxOYnpUd2N6a0lRcE1VR3NrcEgwNTBNcW90U016MTZfUVE5ak1MQ2ZYdDNWcEtpVHRKV0xVank5dWJBaDVEMGZnRjZETHVRRVlMeTdvRUloZDVkTkpZT0V4VURCdUNsX1N5YnBtXzFaMjNlX21la0lwR3NtbVY2QUJadU9iZWpnMXNoTWlITDhnM0xJeHM4cVHSAYwBQVVfeXFMTkF1dmRlNlgwRDZVM2dtUVBNN09ob0FkejJld0JDN05vR1JtTlpSSjFiTU1vZWR3bl9UT2hxcHhvZWY3MkFhSHdYSXo2Sms4b0lKQXB2NUpjcm5MNE1zd3ZRSE5QSTk2OE9qcERmQTZZeFBxaERJRFplUzFwR2NTMlYxeGpHeWh0bjBabXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            To be diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/metabolic-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a person must have three of the following conditions: a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high blood triglycerides, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, also known as HDL or “good” cholesterol.

            “The key takeaway (of the study) is that metabolic syndrome significantly increases the risk of developing young-onset dementia,” which is dementia before age 65, said principal study investigator Dr. Minwoo Lee, in an email. “Our findings highlight the importance of managing metabolic health early to potentially prevent dementia and maintain brain health.”

            The study analyzed data of nearly 2 million people from the Korean National Health Insurance Service who underwent health checkups.

            “Each component — such as elevated blood pressure, high blood sugar, obesity, abnormal cholesterol levels — is individually linked to higher dementia risk,” said Lee, assistant professor in the department of neurology at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital in South Korea.

            The finding suggests an increased risk for much of the US population, as about 1 in 3 adults in the United States have metabolic syndrome, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000l3b6o0kkzur7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The conditions that make up metabolic syndrome may not seem immediately connected to dementia risk, but there are a few ways that vascular health can impact cognitive decline, Isaacson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000m3b6o77yqfqzy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Metabolic syndrome can lead to inflammation, and “when someone has inflammation in the body and in the brain, it can fast-forward aging,” Isaacson said. “And when you have inflammation in the brain, things don’t work as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000n3b6ope1tcmfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your blood vessels working efficiently is also important to cognitive health to keep enough oxygen flowing to the brain, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000o3b6o7ybj8blq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And finally, he noted that metabolic syndrome may affect the brain’s ability to metabolize energy, which may lead to cognitive impairment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000p3b6oe9gg88vm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The different conditions that make up metabolic syndrome tend to happen together because they have similar causes and impact one another, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000q3b6otxfhm991@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When a person is physically inactive and has an unhealthy diet … and someone is not sleeping and just kind of burning the candle at both ends … poor activity, low exercise: These are the medical or clinical manifestations of that sort of thing,” Isaacson said. “That’s why these risk factors often flock together — because they really are interrelated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000r3b6oub6ls64m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because both genetic and lifestyle factors contribute&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to dementia cases, some people can do everything their doctor suggests and still get dementia, Isaacson said. But making healthy lifestyle changes and addressing metabolic syndrome may still prevent or delay dementia in many people, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000s3b6od03oyjqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treatment for metabolic syndrome, which can also increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, starts with lifestyle changes, said Dr. Pam Taub, a preventive cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Diego. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000t3b6odvvmam5u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In general, the lifestyle recommendations that we recommend are really having a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/01/health/mediterranean-diet-recipes-wellness/index.html"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, a diet that is balanced in terms of proteins, carbohydrates, and fiber, and also limiting the amount of calorie intake,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000u3b6obfdxbagx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of Taub’s research into metabolic syndrome shows that time-restricted eating can help manage the conditions, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000v3b6o7ixesjvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maintaining regular physical activity is key, though the amount and the proportion of strength, cardio and flexibility training may be specific to you and discussed with your doctor, she said. Getting enough sleep and handling stress are also essential in managing almost every chronic condition, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000w3b6of0lzz2ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, we can’t control the stress that’s thrown at us, but it’s how we modulate our response that is important,” Taub said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000x3b6o2oy79lx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But lifestyle changes alone may not solve the problem completely, she said. Your doctor may recommend medications to help with blood pressure, blood sugar, insulin resistance, lipid lowering and weight management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9u3xxwo000y3b6o5cf0pr8b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really not one or the other,” Taub said. “You have to synergize both lifestyle and pharmacology.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

It’s also shaped like the letter H and can be worn either vertically or horizontally, depending on preference (I found it sticks to my skin better when I wore it vertically, looking like the letter H). I had my boyfriend try this tape, as well, and he noted that he pulled some mustache hairs out while removing it, which did hurt—take note if you have facial hair and want to try mouth-taping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nordstrom.com/s/mouth-tape/7798817" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/7EaqjGTiGVEZLexsfubg4muH8whVaNRbmGWFPUZtXxyXPM2ZAmaqxA9juAjJY9S7HrjYRFk5sJsJKKYUxfwtZBnC5NXTjCfh735oQjKVWK9iySSQ74WbrqKMDHhKSc5Q21hGRzc6XxwJ6pFKBaBDA"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/7EaqjGTiGVEZLexsfubg4muH8whVaNRbmGWFPUZtXxyXPM2ZAmaqxA9juAjJY9S7HrjYRFk5sJsJKKYUxfwtZBnC5NXTjCfh735oQjKVWK9iySSQ74WbrqKMDHhKSc5Q21hGRzc6XxwJ6pFKBaBDA" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;Skinny Confidential&lt;/a&gt;’s mouth tape is pink, so I’m automatically a sucker for that.

But I wanted to get some experts’ takes on it too. Is it safe to sleep with mouth tape? Is there anyone who shouldn’t use mouth tape? Ahead, everything you need to know about sleeping with mouth tape, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is sleeping with mouth tape safe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes—sleeping with mouth tape is safe, but with some caveats. You can sleep with mouth tape if “your nasal passages are clear and not prone to congestion, and if you do not have moderate to severe sleep apnea,” says Anjali Rajpal, DMD, a cosmetic dentist at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://bhdentalarts.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://bhdentalarts.com/"}' href="https://bhdentalarts.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beverly Hills Dental Arts&lt;/a&gt; in Beverly Hills. If your snoring is caused by sleep apnea, you should avoid mouth tape, and if you’re not sure if you have sleep apnea, Power says to get a medical sleep test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel hesitant to start mouth-taping, “it is best to try it for short naps first and to tape it partially to monitor how you feel,” adds Dr. Rajpal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you want to use tape that’s specifically created for this purpose, both experts note. “Specialized mouth tape allows for easy removal and does not block airflow completely in emergencies,” says Dr. Rajpal. “Using a gentle, breathable tape is recommended to avoid skin irritation or panic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For healthy adults who want to enhance their sleep, Power believes it can be a great tool. But if you snore, take caution: “My biggest concern is that people often use it to cover up snoring, which is frequently a sign of undiagnosed sleep apnea. That’s not just unhelpful—it can be dangerous,” she warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jDNkKp" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE fjaOW caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI gNkiCc asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd eegjEw fNaHcW caption__credit"&gt;Original image by Catharine Malzahn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why do people sleep with their mouths taped?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleeping with mouth tape encourages nasal-breathing and discourages mouth-breathing, which comes with a slew of benefits. “Many people report deeper, more rejuvenating sleep and fewer sleep disruptions throughout the night, but this is not well proven in research,” Power notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="4" class="heading-h4"&gt;To encourage nasal-breathing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Paltrow also noted, mouth-taping “can help optimize sleep quality and improve breathing by promoting nasal-breathing,” says Dr. Rajpal. “Taping the mouth encourages breathing through the nose, which is a more natural and efficient way to breathe while sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>glamour.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 19:50:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE84MzNqQWlKUDgwN1M5ZGg3T3l0d2RGQ3kyZ3cxb2d0RG1VVldZdmVyeEJCM3pWZUZqR3pja2I2TllBOTA0MjBRcWRUbnZSSGxOYzlBUE10WGk5YUZCd0t4dG42YkRlWEhfNDV3dUROeGgzcjg</guid></item><item><title>患有麻疹的婴儿通过西雅图-塔科马国际机场、儿童医院-《西雅图时报》 | Infant with measles went through Sea-Tac Airport, Children’s hospital - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQWW5vc2Jaek9yRndBWmgyTDAwQWt6TThIdEFrOVdsUHVCdUN0b0RXOUR2N3dXb2tMN2UzMjZuRGJBT2xjTkR5UnhGMF9RYVFuQng0MmZWNlJiemF5Rm5xOWdYRHNnX3VtWVdfcDhQSVJ3Q0ZOOTktV0pyZWhfWGtXcDVRblBHRkNzZmp5eC03amR5R2FGVHFzemFpcEZ6RVhxSUlWWTQxYk41Y2J0MURfVEpIektzYUhl?oc=5</link><description>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQWW5vc2Jaek9yRndBWmgyTDAwQWt6TThIdEFrOVdsUHVCdUN0b0RXOUR2N3dXb2tMN2UzMjZuRGJBT2xjTkR5UnhGMF9RYVFuQng0MmZWNlJiemF5Rm5xOWdYRHNnX3VtWVdfcDhQSVJ3Q0ZOOTktV0pyZWhfWGtXcDVRblBHRkNzZmp5eC03amR5R2FGVHFzemFpcEZ6RVhxSUlWWTQxYk41Y2J0MURfVEpIektzYUhl?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Infant with measles went through Sea-Tac Airport, Children’s hospital&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFA1VmFkaFZMMWgwRkZRUWR1TGZ3WVNzdFVveVhzOE1naVlubmxPZHB0N2ZYejYyZk9VMHZXYTVFclFCdGpJREFiX2EtbkpOUWV1YWJfWC1kWndMMGpocnpVS01hdmNDaHBrWHVB?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Fifth measles case in WA confirmed, locations revealed&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;MyNorthwest.com&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxOWDFCZERqb0hqVW9sQkpuYy05VGF2LTJHVzl0Unp2VmpHN05KajNaOUxqbWtSWXZmQ3JWTXFZNzZKcmVzc3R4emlGWVFDU2dYdk5tWmFkU3FZU1d6eGd5WWNjM1g1OVZ2MnE1OFZVblNYNUIwVGVQbWwwMm15Mmd6VTY4enpqUkRCU1BjV3gyaXJxdXBMdzg3YnNzVWlWRnpibXg4VnY5endZaDFKYlVRVlhDRU9rQTQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Fifth case of measles in Washington state identified in a King County infant&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;King County (.gov)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.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?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Infant measles case confirmed in King County;

By combining brain imaging with clinical data, researchers developed machine learning models that accurately predicted treatment outcomes across two large trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding brain-based biomarkers significantly improved prediction accuracy over traditional factors like age or symptom severity. This marks a major step toward personalized, faster, and more effective treatment for depression—reducing the frustration of trial-and-error prescribing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Based Prediction:&lt;/strong&gt; Connectivity in a key brain region improves antidepressant outcome forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Trial Success:&lt;/strong&gt; Models trained in one study accurately predicted outcomes in another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Personalization:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings pave the way for tailored depression treatments based on brain scans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;CAMH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding the right antidepressant treatment can be a frustrating, time-consuming process — one that often requires individuals to endure weeks of ineffective medication before trying something new. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study offers hope for a more personalized approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109053"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-scan-antidepressants-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;They found that adding a brain connectivity marker to traditional clinical data (such as age, sex and baseline depression severity) significantly improved prediction performance across both studies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, the study reveals promising progress toward predicting how patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) will respond to antidepressant medications using brain imaging and clinical data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrated that brain connectivity patterns — specifically in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex — could significantly improve predictions of treatment response across two large, independent clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In spite of the availability of several antidepressant treatments, including medications and psychotherapy, many individuals with depression have difficulties finding the treatment that works best for them,” said Diego Pizzagalli, PhD, director of the Noel Drury, M.D. Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries at UC Irvine and Distinguished Professor at the Charlie Dunlop School of Biological Sciences and the School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, for many, treatment follows a trial-and-error approach. Discovering brain-based markers predicting positive antidepressant response promises to allow a more personalized treatment and thereby speed up reduction of symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning models trained on clinical and neuroimaging data from more than 350 participants in two international trials — EMBARC in the U.S. and CANBIND-1 in Canada — the researchers evaluated whether their algorithms could reliably predict who would respond to common antidepressants like sertraline and escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that adding a brain connectivity marker to traditional clinical data (such as age, sex and baseline depression severity) significantly improved prediction performance across both studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified a brain connectivity marker that was predictive of response to common antidepressants across two large-scale clinical trials in the U.S. and Canada,” explained Peter Zhukovsky, a former postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Pizzagalli’s laboratory and now Scientist in the Brain Health Imaging Centre at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The predictive performance of our algorithm was improved by the addition of the brain connectivity feature to clinical and demographic markers, reaching moderate levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings are promising for the search for biomarkers predicting depression response. We hope these efforts will help connect patients with treatments that are most likely to work for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also tackled the often-overlooked challenge of generalizability — whether a prediction model developed in one trial will hold up in a completely separate population. That’s where this research stands out. Models trained on one trial performed surprisingly well when tested on another, highlighting the potential for broader real-world use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data harmonization and building a large-scale database with different treatments is challenging,” noted Zhukovsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we’re hopeful that cross-trial analyses such as the one we conducted in this project will advance precision medicine goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s implications are far-reaching. By developing biomarkers that are not limited to one treatment setting or population, researchers are laying the groundwork for clinical tools that could eventually match patients with effective treatments earlier, potentially reducing suffering and speeding recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We investigated biomarkers predicting antidepressant treatment response,” Zhukovsky added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, many other options are available for treating depression and if we can identify markers for specific treatments, then the resulting decision support tools could be tested in biomarker-guided clinical studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mental health disorders continue to rise globally, the need for faster, data-driven treatment approaches is more urgent than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s findings underscore the promise of brain-based diagnostics to transform how depression is treated. But they also stress that more research is needed — larger trials, new treatment comparisons and real-world implementation studies — to bring these insights from the lab to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of work will be one of the key priorities within the recently launched Noel Drury, M.D. Institute for Translational Depression Discoveries at UC Irvine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was made possible through a multi-institutional collaboration among researchers from McLean Hospital and Harvard Medical School; the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center; the New York State Psychiatric Institute; Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons; Stony Brook University; the University of Toronto; and the Centre for Depression and Suicide Studies at Unity Health Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EMBARC study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (U01MH092221 and U01MH092250).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAN-BIND-1 trial was conducted in partnership with, and received financial support from, the Ontario Brain Institute and the Brain-CODE platform, with partial funding from the government of Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and psychopharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9be1faf8b5f8faf7ffecfef7f7dbf8faf6f3b5f8fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zachary Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://camh.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CAMH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Zachary Caldwell – CAMH&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.1310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Generalizability of Treatment Outcome Prediction Across Antidepressant Treatment Trials in Depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Diego Pizzagalli et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generalizability of Treatment Outcome Prediction Across Antidepressant Treatment Trials in Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several predictive models for response to antidepressant treatment have emerged on the basis of individual clinical trials, it is unclear whether such models generalize to different clinical and geographical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess whether neuroimaging and clinical features predict response to sertraline and escitalopram in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) across 2 multisite studies using machine learning and to predict change in depression severity in 2 independent studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This prognostic study included structural and functional resting-state magnetic resonance imaging and clinical and demographic data from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) randomized clinical trial (RCT), which administered sertraline (in stage 1 and stage 2) and placebo, and the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CANBIND-1) RCT, which administered escitalopram. EMBARC recruited participants with MDD (aged 18-65 years) at 4 academic sites across the US between August 2011 and December 2015. CANBIND-1 recruited participants with MDD from 6 outpatient centers across Canada between August 2013 and December 2016. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prediction performance for treatment response was assessed using balanced classification accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). In secondary analyses, prediction performance was assessed using observed vs predicted correlations between change in depression severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 363 adult patients (225 from EMBARC and 138 from CANBIND-1; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [13.1] years; 235 women [64.7%]), the best-performing models using pretreatment clinical features and functional connectivity of the dorsal anterior cingulate had moderate cross-trial generalizability for antidepressant treatment (trained on CANBIND-1 and tested on EMBARC, AUC = 0.62 for stage 1 and AUC = 0.67 for stage 2; trained on EMBARC stage 1 and tested on CANBIND-1, AUC = 0.66). The addition of neuroimaging features improved the prediction performance of antidepressant response compared with clinical features only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of early-treatment (week 2) instead of pretreatment depression severity scores resulted in the best generalization performance, comparable to within-trial performance. Multivariate regressions showed substantial cross-trial generalizability in change in depression severity (predicted vs observed &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; ranging from 0.31 to 0.39).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this prognostic study of depression outcomes, models predicting response to antidepressants show substantial generalizability across different RCTs of adult MDD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 19:38:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFByVzd3UG1QYkY0TGE1ejBHVllGTEJBaUpTX2JrbThsTGp3Q0tjM3UxUmNuUFZqcEpBT3hHMzhJd1pBcGQxUmlNd3UwdjI1OGk0Z3gtdThmbUxnRmpJb25rTFdvdmhZT2tqOVJBQlZn</guid></item><item><title>寄生虫会增加宫颈癌的风险，研究发现- Live Science | Parasitic worm raises risk of cervical cancer, study finds - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPZ0dMaldIenM2eUQtc0tENEZqNUxITWV5azl6RmkzR1VpWUJfclh3WU53SzRES1FHQnFJZDQ5V2dXWG5Ub1JWREp6Vk9fVzZEamhYajBpbE5sREUtaGk1aG0xSjVsZFNXRHJBampBc3NLOTdVdUYyLVVwLXJlcDNncjYzUzZTOTliOS0yM2NMWmFJNDl5bEFRelNRQU52OEtt?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

To investigate how the worm might affect the cervix, researchers analyzed tissue samples from 39 women in Tanzania — 20 with active infections and 19 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the infected participants received the standard treatment, a drug called praziquantel. Tissue samples were collected before this treatment and then again four to 12 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed the tissues' gene activity, pinpointing several genes that behaved differently in infected women than in uninfected women; they also identified genes that changed their activity after the antiparasitic treatment. Four of the altered genes are known to play roles in cancer, typically by driving abnormal cell growth and tumors when their activity is turned up too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After treatment, genes involved in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and tissue repair, along with genes associated with the breakdown of the cervix's protective barriers, became more active. These changes were tied to more blood-vessel growth and less cell death, as well as to the activation of some processes seen in cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in the genes that help maintain the cervix's protective barrier are "especially concerning," lead study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://globalhealth.weill.cornell.edu/fellowship/global-health-fellows" target="_blank" data-url="https://globalhealth.weill.cornell.edu/fellowship/global-health-fellows" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Anna Mertelsmann&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at University Hospital Zurich and Weill Cornell Medicine who specializes in infectious diseases and molecular oncology, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1079324" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1079324" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "Without these, women may become more vulnerable to HPV infection and persistence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, these changes in the cervix could open the door to cancer-causing viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-the-worm-raises-cervical-cancer-risk-3"&gt;How the worm raises cervical cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, when the parasite's eggs become lodged in cervical tissue, they provoke a strong inflammatory response, Mertelsmann told Live Science in an email. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-oxidative-stress"&gt;&lt;u&gt;This inflammation produces reactive molecules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that could damage DNA in cells in the surface of the cervix, she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same mechanism is believed to lead to bladder cancer, which can occur when &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium &lt;/em&gt;eggs enter the bladder, Downs said. An estimated 40% to 70% of women and girls infected with the parasite likely have eggs lodged in the genital tract, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the carcinogenic effects of the eggs, the infection triggers repeated cycles of injury and healing that can lead to abnormal tissue growth, Mertelsmann said in an email. Simultaneously, changes in the cervix's protective barrier may impair the body's ability to detect and eliminate precancerous cells before they progress to cancer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that praziquantel may carry risks for cancer, as it was associated with genetic changes linked to the disease. "At least shortly after treatment, the elimination of the &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; might at least transiently increase the risk for oncogenesis," or cancer growth, Mertelsmann told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, while the data point to these cancer-related genetic changes, "we don't know if &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; infection or the treatment causes or contributes to cervical cancer," she emphasized. Longer, larger studies are needed to unpack exactly how the genetic changes might impact cancer risk, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, if left untreated, &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/em&gt; infection &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/symptoms/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can damage organs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the lungs, intestines and spleen, so forgoing treatment would come with its own risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insights from this study could have significant implications for cancer prevention in regions where schistosomiasis is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-an-endemic-disease"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Women diagnosed with &lt;em&gt;S. haematobium &lt;/em&gt;should be closely monitored for early signs of cervical tissue abnormalities," Mertelsmann said in the statement. Additional therapies, such as anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating drugs, may also help to counteract the harmful effects seen after treatment, she suggested. "Moreover, widespread HPV vaccination could play a crucial role in reducing cervical cancer risk for women affected by schistosomiasis," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the researchers are following a larger group of 180 women over a year to confirm these early results. Future studies will explore whether women with a history of schistosomiasis are more likely to develop cervical cancer due to long-term HPV infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-bQKnrmL75b7ET6oUSoWbM4-rQ0gjvUzuoFzg2PlRgqkBjzKgzqkbT5q" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-bQKnrmL75b7ET6oUSoWbM4-rQ0gjvUzuoFzg2PlRgqkBjzKgzqkbT5q slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;According to an April 23 &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/News/2025/Second-2025-Measles-Case" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment (DDPHE), a second 2025 case of measles has been confirmed in the Mile High City, this case involving an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The press release described measles as a "highly contagious" disease, with cases often severe but preventable. The most effective way of preventing measles is through vaccination, which the majority of Americans receive – about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/measles.htm" target="_blank"&gt;91 percent of children born in 2016 were vaccinated by age two&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.denver7.com/news/front-range/denver/denvers-second-measles-case-of-the-year-found-in-adult-relative-of-unvaccinated-infant" target="_blank"&gt;Denver7&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent Denver case involves a relative of an infant who was taken to Mexico while still too young to be vaccinated, bringing measles back to Colorado upon their return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as how contagious measles is, CPR reports that up to &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;nine of every ten people&lt;/a&gt; exposed to the virus behind the disease without vaccination can be infected. Meanwhile, DDPHE reports that two doses of the MMR vaccine offer long-last protection that's &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Public-Health-Environment/News/2025/Second-2025-Measles-Case" target="_blank"&gt;97 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DDPHE press release on the matter encouraged vaccination, but also noted that there is no risk of measles to the general public regarding this new case, given that most of the public has been vaccinated for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles primarily affects the respiratory system, resulting in symptoms of fever, a cough, and a runny nose, often followed by the red rash that the disease is known for. While many people recover, it can lead to death. CPR &lt;a href="https://www.cpr.org/2025/04/01/colorado-below-herd-immunity-for-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that an estimated 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles and 400 to 500 people died each year prior to when the vaccine was introduced. To help put those numbers into perspective, as of April 17 of this year, a total of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;800 cases had been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in 2025 nationwide. Between 2020 and 2024, a single case of measles was confirmed in Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when your blood presses relentlessly against your artery walls. As this pressure rises, your heart is forced to work harder than usual to pump blood through your body. Over time, this extra workload can damage blood vessels and heighten the risk of serious complications like heart attack and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Half of adults in the U.S. live with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, it often goes unnoticed in the early stages, earning it the nickname “the silent killer.” While managing high blood pressure typically includes lifestyle changes and medication, many people turn to supplements for additional support. Although many of these pills and powders contain naturally derived ingredients, not all are as heart-friendly and innocent as they may seem. To help protect your ticker, we reached out to a cardiologist and a cardiovascular dietitian to find out which supplements you should avoid if you have high blood pressure.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-bitter-orange"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Bitter Orange &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bitter orange extract, derived from the dried peel of the bitter orange fruit, is often used in supplements marketed for weight loss and athletic performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, for people with high blood pressure, this extract can pose a serious risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This herb contains synephrine, which can raise blood pressure and trigger dangerous heart rhythms,” says&lt;a href="https://myhhn.org/meet-our-founders/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Columbus Batiste, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a board-certified interventional cardiologist and co-founder of Healthy Heart Nation. For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that prolonged bitter orange use may raise systolic blood pressure (the top reading) by 6 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (the bottom reading) by 4 mmHg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This supplement may also raise the likelihood of serious complications like heart attack and stroke. Like many of the supplements on this list, bitter orange is frequently combined with other ingredients. So, label reading is critical.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-licorice-root"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Licorice Root &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Known for its distinctively sweet flavor and soothing properties, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877890/health-benefits-of-licorice-root/#:~:text=If%20you%20decide%20to%20give,can%20lead%20to%20serious%20complications." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;licorice root&lt;/a&gt; has traditionally been used as an herbal remedy to ease digestive issues, fight viruses and soothe sore throats.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, “if you have high blood pressure, it’s best to avoid licorice supplements or products containing licorice as a secondary ingredient,” says &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiovascular dietitian and owner of Entirely Nourished. This is because licorice contains glycyrrhizic acid, a compound that can cause the body to retain sodium, potentially increasing blood pressure. One study found that even low doses of licorice root containing as little as 100 milligrams of glycyrrhizic acid may significantly raise blood pressure when consumed regularly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, licorice root has been shown to decrease potassium levels. That can lead to muscle weakness and irregular heart rhythms, putting further strain on the heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While some licorice root supplements claim to be free of glycyrrhizic acid, keep in mind that supplements aren’t regulated in the same way as foods. That means you may not always be getting what the label says. For instance, the above study found that the glycyrrhizic acid content of the supplement tested was actually 50% higher than the amount listed on the supplement label.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-caffeine-containing-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Caffeine-Containing Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine isn’t just in your morning coffee or afternoon tea. It’s also a common ingredient in many supplements that claim to boost energy, improve alertness and enhance physical performance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, this popular stimulant can cause a temporary spike in blood pressure, making it a risky choice for those with hypertension, says Routhenstein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that caffeine supplements raised systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 2 mmHg. While this slight increase in blood pressure might seem harmless, even a small bump of around 2 mmHg can impact heart health in high-risk individuals. If you’re wondering how much is safe, we all metabolize caffeine differently, so the answer is different for everyone. Even small amounts of caffeine may spike blood pressure in some people. And the more you consume, the more those numbers climb. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to looking for caffeine on your supplement’s label, you’ll also want to keep an eye out for guarana. This caffeine-rich ingredient, often found in energy supplements and drinks, also raises heart rate and blood pressure, says Batiste.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-yohimbine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Yohimbine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yohimbine, a compound found in the bark of the yohimbe tree, is frequently found in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/herbal-teas-to-avoid-high-blood-pressure-8691951" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supplements and teas &lt;/a&gt;marketed for weight loss, athletic performance, improved sexual health and—ironically—high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Not so fast, says Batiste. “Yohimbine is a stimulant that can dangerously raise blood pressure and heart rate,” he warns. Routhenstein agrees, explaining that it increases blood pressure by raising the levels of a hormone and messenger called norepinephrine. And as norepinephrine levels rise, blood vessels begin to narrow, impairing blood flow and leading to higher blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-ephedra"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Ephedra &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ephedra is an herbal dietary supplement that has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for colds, headaches, coughs and fever, particularly in China and India. Fast-forward to the 21st century when it became a sought-after ingredient in dietary supplements promoted for weight loss, physical performance and enhanced energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it is far from risk-free. “This herb contains ephedrine alkaloids, strong stimulant compounds linked to high blood pressure, heart attacks, strokes and even sudden death,” says Batiste. “It can also interfere with blood pressure and heart medications, making them less effective.” Due to these serious side effects, ephedra has been banned by the Food and Drug Administration for use in supplements. Although it’s banned in dietary supplements, its active ingredient, ephedrine, can be found in some allergy and asthma medications&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, you should always consult your health care provider before taking anything with ephedra listed in the ingredients.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keeping your blood pressure in check isn’t just about avoiding certain supplements. A healthy lifestyle can have a significant impact on your numbers. For instance, avoiding cigarettes and limiting alcohol are proven ways to reduce your risk of hypertension. These expert-approved tips can also help:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow the DASH Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289964/7-day-dash-diet-menu/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; (short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) has a long, solid track record for lowering blood pressure. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, fish, lean meats and low-fat dairy products, yet is low in trans and saturated fats and added sugars.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Regularly: &lt;/strong&gt;For better blood pressure, the American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity each week. They also suggest muscle-strengthening exercises like weight lifting at least two days per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, sleep impacts your blood pressure, too! Strive for seven to nine hours of restful sleep each night. If you snort, snore or momentarily stop breathing during the night, you may have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7908018/sleep-apnea-can-make-heart-disease-worse-a-new-study-proves/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;, a hidden cause of high blood pressure. If that sounds familiar, speak with your doctor, who can help you find effective treatment..&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Everyone is stressed out sometimes. But when stress becomes the norm, it can raise your blood pressure. Meditation, deep breathing, practicing gratitude, adopting hobbies you enjoy and connecting with friends and loved ones can all help restore calm in your life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Store shelves are filled with supplements claiming to improve your health. While some supplements may offer certain health benefits, others can raise blood pressure or negatively interact with blood pressure-lowering medications. Cardiologists and dietitians agree there are specific supplements you shouldn’t take if you have high blood pressure, especially bitter orange, licorice root, caffeine, yohimbine and ephedra. Because supplements can contain multiple ingredients, it’s especially important to take the time to read the ingredient list. If you’re considering taking these or any other supplements, talk to your health care provider to make sure that they’re safe and effective for your unique health needs.&lt;br&gt;

You typically don't see those things unless there is a major acute event that has occurred.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Usually, the worst of the immediate effects are in somebody with an illness like asthma or emphysema (where tiny air sacs in the lungs are damaged or destroyed),' Dr Gupta continued.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Heavily polluted air could cause an exacerbation like chest pain, short breathing, and may require these people to go to the hospital,' the pulmonologist added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One person revealed on X that they had received &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/J5182J/status/1915111352328147270"&gt;an air quality alert message&lt;/a&gt; on their phone, warning that 'everyone is even more likely to experience serious health effects.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another person on X shared a message from their son, showing that Chicago's air was inundated with both carbon monoxide and PM10 - meaning particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both are toxic to humans, but they harm the body in different ways and vary in their toxicity depending on exposure levels and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The readings, taken at 2pm ET, showed that Chicago was seeing carbon monoxide levels of 318 ppb (parts per billion) in their air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While that level is relatively low in terms of outdoor air quality, the amount of fine particulate matter in the air set off alarm bells on Google Maps' air quality tracking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chicago's reported PM10 concentration of 669 µg/m³ (micrograms per cubic meter) is extremely bad and fell into the 'Hazardous' category of the Air Quality Index, indicating serious health risks for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, many on Reddit argued that both AccuWeather and IQAir had listed the city's air quality as either 'fair' or 'good.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conversely, air quality readings produced by Apple were also registering a major problem in the Chicago area on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Social media users on X shared disturbing images of what appeared to be an air quality emergency in Chicago Wednesday afternoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Levels of fine particulate matter reportedly reached extremely hazardous levels and set off air quality alerts on mobile phones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Why is my iPhone weather app telling me that Chicago’s air quality is hazardous right now but other websites say otherwise?' an X user asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some commenters suspected that the extreme air quality emergency may have been nothing more than a glitch in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;IQAir reported that there were only a handful of small fires being reported on in the area Wednesday, but nothing large enough to cause an environmental emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tragically, one firefighter did die while battling a blaze on Chicago's west side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chicago is known for poor air quality.

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;rare sixth-century sword&lt;/strong&gt; has been uncovered in an Anglo-Saxon burial site near Canterbury, England. This remarkable find offers new insights into early medieval life and could reshape our understanding of Anglo-Saxon society and weaponry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The discovery, widely covered in media like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/26/really-incredible-sixth-century-sword-found-in-kent" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is comparable to the famous Sutton Hoo sword and has been detailed in a report by the University of Central Lancashire.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ancient Weaponry in Perfect Condition&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sword, which was found in excellent condition, boasts a &lt;strong&gt;silver-and-gilt hilt &lt;/strong&gt;adorned with &lt;strong&gt;intricate decorative patterns&lt;/strong&gt;, making it an exceptional example of high-status weaponry from the early medieval period. Its blade bears an embossed runic script. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, parts of the sword’s scabbard—crafted from leather and wood and lined with beaver fur—have remarkably survived centuries of wear and decay. Duncan Sayer, the lead archaeologist on the project, emphasized the uniqueness of the sword, stating that it “rivals the swords from Dover and Sutton Hoo.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alice Roberts, professor and presenter of &lt;em&gt;Digging for Britain,&lt;/em&gt; also noted the discovery’s importance, calling it “&lt;strong&gt;an astonishing sword&lt;/strong&gt;” amid an extraordinary Anglo-Saxon cemetery filled with weaponry and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/archaeologists-unearth-1874-message-in-a-bottle-from-a-viking-grave-a-150-year-old-secret-revealed/"&gt;finely furnished graves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery: An Unprecedented Find&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery was made in a previously unexplored Anglo-Saxon cemetery located in Kent, a region rich with historical significance. Archaeologists have so far excavated twelve graves, with estimates suggesting that&lt;strong&gt; around 200 more remain buried at the site&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These graves date back to the fifth and sixth centuries, a period in Anglo-Saxon history that remains largely enigmatic due to the limited written records from the time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; cemetery&lt;/strong&gt; has yielded numerous other artifacts, including iron spear-points, &lt;strong&gt;seaxes (Anglo-Saxon knives)&lt;/strong&gt;, and an array of decorative items, all of which offer a wealth of information about the burial practices and material culture of the Anglo-Saxons. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that the cemetery is the final resting place of individuals who were part of the elite class. The &lt;strong&gt;exact location of the cemetery&lt;/strong&gt; has been kept secret, as excavations are ongoing. Duncan Sayer explained that revealing the site’s location could jeopardize further research and preservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Sword’s Symbolism: A Royal Connection?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the fascinating features of the sword is the presence of a ring attached to its pommel, which archaeologists believe might symbolize an oath or a bond with a high-status figure, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/3000-year-old-secret-tutankhamun-tomb/" data-type="post" data-id="83600"&gt;possibly a king.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This detail opens a window into the social and political structures of the Anglo-Saxon elite. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The presence of such symbols and the&lt;strong&gt; sword’s high craftsmanship&lt;/strong&gt; suggest that the individual buried with this weapon was a person of considerable importance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Window Into Anglo-Saxon Life&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Historians and archaeologists alike have long struggled with the lack of written records from this period, often referred to as the “&lt;strong&gt;Dark Ages&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the ongoing excavation at this site, combined with the sword’s survival. Once fully researched and conserved, the sword will be displayed at the &lt;a href="https://kentdowns.org.uk/activities/folkestone-museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Folkestone Museum in Kent&lt;/a&gt;, where visitors will have the opportunity to witness a tangible connection to this fascinating period of history.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“ Now it’s absolutely definite that there has to have been a &lt;strong&gt;very significant influx&lt;/strong&gt;, especially in the east coast taking place over generations. They’re not coming from one place, but multiple places. This cemetery is right at the cutting-edge of that work,” explained Sayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT have developed a noninvasive medical monitoring device powerful enough to detect single cells within blood vessels, yet small enough to wear like a wristwatch. One important aspect of this wearable device is that it can enable continuous monitoring of circulating cells in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology was presented online on March 3 by the journal &lt;em&gt;npj Biosensing &lt;/em&gt;and is forthcoming in the journal’s print version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device — named CircTrek — was developed by researchers in the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek research group, led by Deblina Sarkar, assistant professor at MIT and AT&amp;amp;T Career Development Chair at the MIT Media Lab. This technology could greatly facilitate early diagnosis of disease, detection of disease relapse, assessment of infection risk, and determination of whether a disease treatment is working, among other medical processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas traditional blood tests are like a snapshot of a patient’s condition, CircTrek was designed to present real-time assessment, referred to in the &lt;em&gt;npj Biosensing&lt;/em&gt; paper as having been “an unmet goal to date.” A different technology that offers monitoring of cells in the bloodstream with some continuity, in vivo flow cytometry, “requires a room-sized microscope, and patients need to be there for a long time,” says Kyuho Jang, a PhD student in Sarkar’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CircTrek, on the other hand, which is equipped with an onboard Wi-Fi module, could even monitor a patient’s circulating cells at home and send that information to the patient’s doctor or care team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CircTrek offers a path to harnessing previously inaccessible information, enabling timely treatments, and supporting accurate clinical decisions with real-time data,” says Sarkar. “Existing technologies provide monitoring that is not continuous, which can lead to missing critical treatment windows. We overcome this challenge with CircTrek.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device works by directing a focused laser beam to stimulate cells beneath the skin that have been fluorescently labeled. Such labeling can be accomplished with a number of methods, including applying antibody-based fluorescent dyes to the cells of interest or genetically modifying such cells so that they express fluorescent proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a patient receiving CAR T cell therapy, in which immune cells are collected and modified in a lab to fight cancer (or, experimentally, to combat HIV or Covid-19), could have those cells labeled at the same time with fluorescent dyes or genetic modification so the cells express fluorescent proteins. Importantly, cells of interest can also be labeled with in vivo labeling methods approved in humans. Once the cells are labeled and circulating in the bloodstream, CircTrek is designed to apply laser pulses to enhance and detect the cells’ fluorescent signal while an arrangement of filters minimizes low-frequency noise such as heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We optimized the optomechanical parts to reduce noise significantly and only capture the signal from the fluorescent cells,” says Jang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detecting the labeled CAR T cells, CircTrek could assess whether the cell therapy treatment is working. As an example, persistence of the CAR T cells in the blood after treatment is associated with better outcomes in patients with B-cell lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep CircTrek small and wearable, the researchers were able to miniaturize the components of the device, such as the circuit that drives the high-intensity laser source and keeps the power level of the laser stable to avoid false readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sensor that detects the fluorescent signals of the labeled cells is also minute, and yet it is capable of detecting a quantity of light equivalent to a single photon, Jang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device’s subcircuits, including the laser driver and the noise filters, were custom-designed to fit on a circuit board measuring just 42 mm by 35 mm, allowing CircTrek to be approximately the same size as a smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CircTrek was tested on an in vitro configuration that simulated blood flow beneath human skin, and its single-cell detection capabilities were verified through manual counting with a high-resolution confocal microscope. For the in vitro testing, a fluorescent dye called Cyanine5.5 was employed. That particular dye was selected because it reaches peak activation at wavelengths within skin tissue’s optical window, or the range of wavelengths that can penetrate the skin with minimal scattering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety of the device, particularly the temperature increase on experimental skin tissue caused by the laser, was also investigated. An increase of 1.51 degrees Celsius at the skin surface was determined to be well below heating that would damage tissue, with enough of a margin that even increasing the device’s area of detection, and its power, in order to ensure the observation of at least one blood vessel could be safely permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While clinical translation of CircTrek will require further steps, Jang says its parameters can be modified to broaden its potential, so that doctors could be provided with critical information on nearly any patient.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that when 15-month-olds heard a new word in a familiar context—like “kumquat” during a conversation about fruit—they later identified the unseen object correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This ability to form a mental “gist” of meaning without direct visual cues marks an early milestone in abstract learning and language development. The findings highlight that babies are not just passive listeners—they actively construct knowledge from the language they hear, even about things they can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Word Inference:&lt;/strong&gt; 15-month-old infants can infer meanings of unseen words using context.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Representation:&lt;/strong&gt; Infants form a “gist” of new words, even without visual cues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; The study reveals how language fuels abstract learning in infancy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human language allows us to learn new words for things we’ve never witnessed directly. We do this seamlessly, for example, in conversations, using clues from the overall context to infer a new word’s meaning.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how early does this ability become available? And what makes it possible to create a new mental representation of an object or event that we cannot see directly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109045"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a baby and fruits." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/language-learning-babies-visual-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although they had never seen any object paired with that novel word, 15-month-olds nevertheless used the context clues to identify which object was most likely the one to which the novel word referred. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by developmental scientists at Northwestern University and Harvard University offers the first evidence that infants as young as 15 months can identify an object they have learned about from listening to language — even if the object remains hidden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine an infant playing with blocks on the floor while listening to parents talk about kumquats in a conversation about more familiar fruits like apples and bananas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might the infant form an initial representation, or gist, about what kumquat means — something edible, likely a fruit? Can they then use this initial gist later when the infant first sees a novel fruit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the questions the researchers sought to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people believe that success in word learning requires that the infant ‘map’ a new word to an object that is physically present (e.g., “Look at the kumquat!”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in the natural course of a day, it is very common for us — and for infants — to hear words when the objects to which they refer to are not available to our immediate perception,” said senior author Sandra Waxman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re asking whether infants, too, can use the conversational contexts in which a word occurs to begin to learn their meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman is the Louis W. Menk Professor of Psychology, director of the Infant and Child Development Center and an Institute for Policy Research Fellow at Northwestern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s co-author is Elena Luchkina, formerly a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern, and now a research scientist at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers engaged 134 infants, 67 each at 12 months and 15 months in a three-part task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers presented infants with words they understand, paired with an image of the object to which it referred (e.g., apple, banana, grapes). Next, infants heard a new word while the image of a novel object (e.g., a kumquat) was hidden from their view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, two novel objects appeared (e.g., a kumquat and a whisk) and infants were asked, e.g., “where is the kumquat?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen-month-olds, but not 12-month-olds, looked longer at the novel fruit (e.g. kumquat) than the novel artifact (e.g., whisk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they had never seen any object paired with that novel word, 15-month-olds nevertheless used the context clues to identify which object was most likely the one to which the novel word referred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study shows that even babies who are just beginning to say their first words learn from the language they hear, even if the objects or events being discussed are not present,” Waxman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Babies take in what they hear, and even if no object is present, they form a mental representation, or ‘gist’ of the new word’s meaning, one that is strong enough for them to use later when its referent object does appear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman suggested that at 12 months, infants may not yet know enough of the familiar words they heard in the context to begin to form a representation or gist of the new word’s meaning (e.g., that it is likely another fruit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gleaning the meaning of kumquat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By introducing infants to novel words in the absence of any visible object, the researchers devised a powerful test of how much infants can learn about the meaning of a novel word based on language input alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study provides new insight for the developmental origins of the human capacity to learn about things that are not perceptually present. It also begins to address how, and how early, the human mind can create mental representations of objects and events never witnessed directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new work also highlights the power of language in infants’ daily lives. In listening to conversations and in book-reading, infants often hear words that they don’t yet understand, and that they cannot ‘map’ immediately to an object or event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this study show that by 15 months, infants spontaneously use the linguistic context in which a new word occurs to build a gist of its meaning that will support subsequent learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we hear new words, like “kumquat” in conversation when there are no kumquats around, we don’t waste the opportunity to home in its meaning,” Waxman said. “We now know this is also true about tiny babies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c8bbbcadb8a0a9a6a1ade6a3bda4a3ad88a6a7babca0bfadbbbcadbaa6e6adacbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stephanie Kulke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://northwestern.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Stephanie Kulke – Northwestern University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0321775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;By 15 months, infants begin to learn new words for objects, even those they’ve never seen&lt;/a&gt;” by Sandra Waxman et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By 15 months, infants begin to learn new words for objects, even those they’ve never seen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human language permits us to call to mind representations of objects, events, and ideas that we cannot witness directly, enabling us to learn about the world far beyond our immediate surroundings. When and how does this capacity emerge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, we evaluated infants at 12 and 15 months, asking whether they establish a representation of a novel noun’s meaning in the absence of any visible referents, and use this representation to identify a candidate referent when it later becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During training, infants (67 12-month-olds; 67 15-month-olds) were primed with words and images of objects from a particular semantic neighborhood (e.g., fruits) and were also introduced to a novel noun (e.g., “a modi”), used to name a hidden object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During test, infants heard that noun again, this time with two unfamiliar objects present—one from the primed neighborhood (e.g., a dragon fruit) and the other from an unrelated semantic neighborhood (e.g., an ottoman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If infants can represent something about the meaning of the novel noun in the absence of a visible referent and then use such a representation when a candidate referent appears, then at test, they should prefer the object from the primed semantic neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 15 months, infants succeeded. In contrast, 12-month-olds did not succeed on this task even after a full week of vocabulary training designed to boost the effect of priming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible then that 12-month-olds’ representations of novel nouns’ meaning are not yet sufficiently rich (if any at all) to guide their choice of referent when one does appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest that the capacity to establish a representation of a novel noun’s meaning in the absence of any visible referent and use this representation later to identify a candidate referent object emerges between 12 and 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:55:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9iazVLVkRRQ1JlR3JsamZlSE93eTlqellSbm0zVzY4VUxHRzdKR0ZLSHlsSHVYTjdQSFk0bXZGZEo2M2dJOHBMUVVpazA3d0FnS0F0WXhPdmc5OFFya29TWXpYUmZHX29WNE04UFdxMHRHSUZ5bFA0</guid></item></channel></rss>
