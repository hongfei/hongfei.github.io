			&lt;p&gt;Canned salmon are the unlikely heroes of an accidental back-of-the-pantry natural history museum, with decades of Alaskan marine ecology preserved in brine and tin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasites can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parasites-are-actually-vital-for-some-species-survival-study-shows"&gt;tell us a lot&lt;/a&gt; about an ecosystem, because they're usually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-want-you-to-stop-hating-on-parasites-and-they-ve-got-a-12-step-plan-to-help"&gt;up in the business of several species&lt;/a&gt;. But unless they cause some major problem to humans, historically we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-we-don-t-know-about-parasites-could-be-disastrous-for-both-us-and-them"&gt;haven't paid them much attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a problem for parasite ecologists, like Natalie Mastick and Chelsea Wood from the University of Washington, who had been searching for a way to retroactively track the effects parasites had on Pacific Northwestern marine mammals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when Wood got a call from Seattle's Seafood Products Association, asking if she'd be interested in taking boxes of dusty old expired cans of salmon – dating back to the 1970s – off their hands, her answer was, unequivocally, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cans had been set aside for decades as part of the association's quality control process, but i&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIYz3FOsYTU"&gt;n the hands of the ecologists&lt;/a&gt;, they became an archive of excellently preserved specimens; not of salmon, but of worms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIYz3FOsYTU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the idea of worms in your canned fish is a bit stomach-turning, these roughly 0.4-inch (1-centimeter) long marine parasites, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisakidae"&gt;anisakids&lt;/a&gt;, are harmless to humans when killed during the canning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everyone assumes that worms in your salmon is a sign that things have gone awry," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Wood when the research was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But the anisakid life cycle integrates many components of the food web. I see their presence as a signal that the fish on your plate came from a healthy ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_123845" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123845" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg" alt="A red circle around tweezers grabbing a piece of cooked salmon" class="size-full wp-image-123845" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/NematodeInSalmon_Body-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-123845" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An anisakid worm (circled in red) in a canned salmon fillet. (Natalie Mastick/University of Washington)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anisakids enter the food web when they are eaten by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill"&gt;krill&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn are eaten by larger species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how anisakids end up in the salmon, and eventually, the intestines of marine mammals, where the worms complete their life cycle by reproducing. Their eggs are excreted into the ocean by the mammal, and the cycle begins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If a host is not present – marine mammals, for example – anisakids can't complete their life cycle and their numbers will drop," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wood, the paper's senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 178 tin cans in the 'archive' contained four different salmon species caught in the Gulf of Alaska and Bristol Bay across a 42-year period (1979–2021), including 42 cans of chum &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chum_salmon"&gt;Oncorhynchus keta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), 22 coho (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coho_salmon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;kisutch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), 62 pink (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_salmon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;gorbuscha&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and 52 sockeye &lt;em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sockeye_salmon"&gt;Oncorhynchus nerka&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the techniques used to preserve the salmon do not, thankfully, keep the worms in pristine condition, the researchers were able to dissect the filets and calculate the number of worms per gram of salmon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_123844" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123844" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg" alt="A brownish worm magnified on a white background" class="size-full wp-image-123844" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/04/DegradedNematodeInSalmon_Body-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-123844" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A highly degraded anisakid found in canned salmon. (&lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;Natalie Mastick/University of Washington&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found worms had increased over time in chum and pink salmon, but not in sockeye or coho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Seeing their numbers rise over time, as we did with pink and chum salmon, indicates that these parasites were able to find all the right hosts and reproduce," &lt;a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2024/04/04/canned-salmon/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mastick, the paper's lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That could indicate a stable or recovering ecosystem, with enough of the right hosts for anisakids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145288" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-642x352.jpg" alt="Graph showing number of cans from each year that contained each species" class="size-medium wp-image-145288" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-642x352.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-756x415.jpg 756w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-768x422.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-1536x843.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-2048x1124.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ece311043-fig-0001-m-600x329.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145288" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The distribution of canned salmon samples available for each salmon species in each decade. (Mastick et al., &lt;em&gt;Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's harder to explain the stable levels of worms in coho and sockeye, especially since the canning process made it difficult to identify the specific species of anisakid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Though we are confident in our identification to the family level, we could not identify the [anisakids] we detected at the species level," the authors &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11043"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So it is possible that parasites of an increasing species tend to infect pink and chum salmon, while parasites of a stable species tend to infect coho and sockeye."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastick and colleagues think this novel approach – dusty old cans turned ecological archive – could fuel many more scientific discoveries. It seems they've opened quite a can of worms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.11043"&gt;Ecology and Evolution.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in April 2024&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NewsNation&lt;/a&gt;) — Researchers at Stanford Medicine have discovered a naturally occurring molecule that they believe is similar to the active ingredient in the same &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/weight-loss-drugs-compound-fda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes drugs&lt;/a&gt; that have shown weight loss potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BRINP2-related peptide, or BRP, is a naturally occurring molecule that can suppress appetite and promote weight loss in mice and pigs without causing common side effects like nausea, according to the &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/ozempic-rival.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery may provide a solution for those who suffer from some of the more severe side effects of Wegovy and Ozempic, which include inflammation of the pancreas, changes in vision, increased risk of thyroid cancer and others.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues,” said assistant professor of pathology Katrin Svensson. “That’s why Ozempic has widespread effects, including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels. In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/health-headlines/ap-yearslong-shortage-of-popular-weight-loss-and-diabetes-drugs-is-resolved-fda-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/ap-about-half-of-americans-approve-of-using-weight-loss-drugs-to-treat-obesity-ap-norc-poll-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; sales have soared in recent years, but shortages and challenges with insurance coverage have made it difficult for many patients to get the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 100 million adults in the U.S. are obese — defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher — and more than 22 million adults are severely obese, with a BMI of 40 or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A worsening measles &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5188576-texas-measles-outbreak-unvaccinated/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5188576-texas-measles-outbreak-unvaccinated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; has spread to two other states, providing Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. his first real test of responding to a major public health incident.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak, which has killed two people to date and sickened nearly 260 &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5191117-measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5191117-measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;across three states&lt;/a&gt;, represents the first time Kennedy has had to reckon with his past as a longtime critic of vaccines and his new leadership of the federal health establishment. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Public health experts and advocates don’t think he is passing.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The response has been “as expected for a Secretary Kennedy HHS. But that’s not saying much,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist who has been tracking the outbreak in her Your Local Epidemiologist newsletter.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has made two appearances on Fox News in recent weeks, where he downplayed the seriousness of measles and touted fringe theories about prevention and treatment, like the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5178797-texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy-vaccines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5178797-texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits of vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; and cod liver oil over the measles vaccine, which is the only proven way to prevent infection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had two measles deaths in 20 years in this country — we have 100,000 autism diagnoses every year,” Kennedy said. “We need to keep our eye on the ball. Chronic disease is our enemy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He suggested that natural immunity gained from a measles infection will provide better and longer-lasting protection than the vaccine. He said local doctors had achieved “almost miraculous and instantaneous” recoveries with steroids or antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he has talked about the shot, he’s framed it as a personal choice while also suggesting the vaccine can cause just as much harm as the disease itself. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks in the past have been all-hands-on-deck affairs across the federal government, Jetelina said, pointing to a 2014 measles outbreak that began at Disneyland as well as the 2019 outbreak in New York. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This outbreak has largely been quiet. We’ve had the distant Fox News interviews. We’ve had one [CDC alert] and that’s about it, and that is not normal compared to past responses, and there’s certainly been very little transparency on what’s being done,” Jetelina said.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) team of infectious disease “detectives” arrived on the ground to aid in the response earlier this month, a move that first required Texas officials to request federal assistance, because the agency can’t send a team without an official state ask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But experts said an early communications blackout across the government ordered by the Trump administration may have prevented local health officials from sharing data and information with HHS, potentially delaying the response. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health experts said one of the essential parts of controlling a measles outbreak is to partner with trusted messengers on the ground to spread the word that vaccines are safe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The messaging should be very clear and straightforward in that the way we stop a measles outbreak is through vaccination. And the way we prevent measles outbreaks is through vaccination. And so that should be the clear, unambiguous message coming out from HHS,” said William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But in a sweeping 34-minute interview that was posted on Fox Nation last week, Kennedy pledged that the CDC team would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency, including vitamin A and an antibiotic called clarithromycin.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phil Huang, director of health and human services in Dallas County, Texas, said he was concerned Kennedy’s words would dilute the message and make it more difficult to persuade people to get vaccinated.     &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy spoke about the distrust many in the Mennonite community have toward vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Vaccines will be “recommended,” Kennedy said, but as a personal choice that must be recognized. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He indicated the Mennonites have raised serious and legitimate concerns about the dangers of vaccines, and that he’d been told a dozen Mennonite children had been injured by vaccines in the county. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy said the public doesn’t know the true risks of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know what the risk profile is for these products. Americans have the right to know to be able to make an informed choice. You need to know the cost and the benefits. And we’ve never quantified the cost. And that’s why there’s so much mistrust and we need to restore government trust,” Kennedy said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate interview with Sean Hannity, Kennedy again touted the benefits of vitamin A as an almost miracle cure, something even a Kennedy adviser has cautioned against. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US – helps in Africa where there is deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” Brett Giroir, a first-term Trump health official now advising Kennedy on infectious disease policy, &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wrote in a post&lt;/a&gt; on the social platform X.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A has been used for years in children in developing countries with severe measles, but doctors have said the evidence of its effectiveness is mixed. It isn’t used widely in the U.S., likely because children aren’t vitamin A-deficient. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, the longtime executive director of the American Public Health Association, said Kennedy’s HHS is already behind the outbreak and risks falling even further, which could result in a national outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“He’s practicing medicine without a license, and he needs to be very careful,” Benjamin said. “Normally, what happens when you have someone who’s not a health professional? Their talking points are written by experts, and they stick to the script. And, you know, he’s saying things that are just wrong.”  &lt;/p&gt;

After all, she was a single parent to a three-year-old. She also worked full-time. Almost every day, when she picked her son up from daycare, she'd fall asleep with him during his afternoon nap. She didn't think much about it. "I just thought, 'Oh, this is motherhood'," says Ryan, who lives in upstate New York, US. At a routine medical check-up in June 2023, her doctor asked if she felt exhausted. Blood test results showed that Ryan had iron deficiency anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Looking back, there had been other signs. Despite regularly working out, Ryan had suddenly started to feel winded on routine hikes. She had also had iron deficiency before, during pregnancy. That time, her midwife suspected it after Ryan mentioned that her only pregnancy craving was ice – a classic sign of pica, which is, in turn, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10199804/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a symptom of iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Iron deficiency is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00029-3/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;most common micronutrient deficiency&lt;/a&gt; in the world today, affecting roughly one in three people. It is especially prevalent among children as well as women of reproductive age, including pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The condition can cause a wide range of consequences.

Infancy," says Mark Corkins, chair of the Committee on Nutrition at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). "You triple your birth weight by a year of age. You double your length." As our bodies grow, they need more blood. And red blood cells are built – in part – on iron. Without that necessary iron, says Corkins, you risk not able to produce enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your growing tissues, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eLrdPC"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-e11d1f0-0 eVThlc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-1 kDQByp"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-e11d1f0-3 fBWdkT"&gt;Iron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, and anaemia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-2 ewSByo"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-e11d1f0-4 gxuhBx"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Anaemia occurs when someone is not producing enough normal red blood cells or haemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen around in your blood. While this can be due to various factors, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(07)61235-5/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;around half of all anaemia cases&lt;/a&gt; are caused by iron deficiency. Adults with this condition, iron-deficiency anaemia, might experience weakness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355034" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;among other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Symptoms in babies and small children are similar, though they might also have sleep issues – particularly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632071/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;frequent night wakes, restlessness during sleep,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3632071/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;difficulty falling asleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Just because someone is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/126/5/1040/65343/Diagnosis-and-Prevention-of-Iron-Deficiency-and" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;iron deficient&lt;/a&gt; does not necessarily mean they will have anaemia. "Iron deficiency can be considered a stage prior to anaemia," says clinical haemotologist Sant-Rayn Pasricha, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health who specialises in iron deficiency and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The severity of the deficiency plays a key role, Pasricha explains. When someone gets low on iron, their body begins to form red blood cells differently, he says. They get smaller and, eventually, the amount of oxygen-carrying haemoglobin in that person's blood drops below a healthy level. "That's when we reach iron deficiency anaemia," Pasricha says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Iron deficiency and anaemia are generally diagnosed with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355040" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;blood test&lt;/a&gt; – usually one that examines levels of ferritin, a protein that helps store iron, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK259/#:~:text=Definition,deciliter%20(g%2Fdl)." class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;haemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="a-matter-of-debate" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-matter-of-debate" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A matter of debate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some specialists question whether iron deficiency is always a cause for concern – especially if it arises in the absence of any physical symptoms and if the patient does not have anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While those women in clinical trials who were iron deficient and reported feeling fatigued found that their fatigue improved upon taking iron supplements, the intervention didn't change the energy levels of women who were also iron deficient, but who had not reported fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This hints to us that, at least in adults, if you're clinically unwell with an iron deficiency, then of course you should be treated and that will improve how you feel," Pasricha says. "But it also suggests that, if you're feeling perfectly fine, and someone just finds that you have a low iron level – then it's hard to be sure that that treating you then would boost you to feel any different."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall, iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia has been studied less than iron-deficiency anaemia. But there are some broad conclusions we can make, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The consensus is that iron-deficiency anaemia is certainly worse," says Zimmermann.

"It's not just about [poor health outcomes] – it is that you didn't maximise your development," Corkins says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This complexity lies at the heart of all nutrition research: is it the absence of a nutrient itself that's the problem, or is that deficiency a sign of something else going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;To complicate matters further, the criteria for defining iron deficiency in children is still up for debate, says Zimmermann. Because children are growing so fast, he adds, iron deficiency normally quickly leads to anaemia – which means it's not easy to find, and study, iron-deficient children who are not anaemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="to-supplement-or-not-to-supplement" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="to-supplement-or-not-to-supplement" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;To supplement or not to supplement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Given that, and the potential consequences for their development, guidelines often advise supplementing children with iron at any sign of deficiency – or even to supplement as a prevention measure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But some researchers question this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We did see that haemoglobin and iron status did improve in the children that received iron – but we didn't see that affect child development," says Pasricha. The "why", he says, "is something that the team is really grappling with".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One possible reason might be that even a brief period of deficiency can lead to long-lasting harm. One study, for example, found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37143078/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;when children had had iron deficiency at birth&lt;/a&gt;, they had less activation in the regions of their brain related to cognitive control at eight to 11 years old – even if their iron levels had been corrected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But another possibility, Pasricha says, is that it isn't the low iron itself that causes poorer development, but that low iron is an indicator of something else – such as other nutrients in a person's diet that are missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Meanwhile, there could also be downsides to supplementing children who don't actually have a deficiency. Some studies have found that babies and toddlers who had adequate iron levels, but received supplementation, had &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673694921512" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;poorer weight gain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12729289/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;less growth&lt;/a&gt; compared to controls. Randomised controlled trials have found that babies randomly assigned to high-iron formula milk scored more poorly on cognitive tests of abilities like visual memory, reading comprehension and mathematics at both &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22064877/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;10 years old&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31253407/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;16 years old&lt;/a&gt;, compared to those on a low-iron formulation. However, exactly how much iron supplementation would avoid these effects remains unclear, the researchers say as other factors could also be involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Supplements can also have other side effects. Zimmermann, for example, has studied &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/64/5/731.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;how supplementation can affect people's microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. Bacteria thrive on iron, he says. The very small amount of iron that breastmilk has is bound to protective substances like lactoferrin, which helps to keep iron away from potential pathogens in the gut – especially protective for babies, who have immature immune systems. Giving a baby aged six months old micronutrient powders containing iron, which is what many experts recommend, could result in a negative outcome, says Zimmermann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"These powders have very high amounts of iron in them… which can cause a very rapid shift in the microbiome," says Zimmermann. The babies can't absorb all that iron, which ends up impacting their gut microbiome – potentially towards a balance favouring "the pathogens we worry most about in babies", he says. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/64/5/731.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;This includes &lt;i id="e.-coli" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which grows prolifically in the presence of iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kxpnwk.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images If an iron deficiency is making an adult feel unwell, iron supplements can help – but the story is less straightforward in children (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;If an iron deficiency is making an adult feel unwell, iron supplements can help – but the story is less straightforward in children (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many clinicians and researchers agree, however, that when someone has iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anaemia along with symptoms, supplementing can be one of the fastest ways to help them improve. One review of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/49/21/1389.short" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;iron deficiency in endurance athletes&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found that supplementation not only improved ferritin and haemoglobin, but athletes' aerobic capacity, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Whether to take supplements – or give them to a child – is something that people should decide with the help of a doctor, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="a-balanced-diet" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="a-balanced-diet" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;A balanced diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Part of the higher recommendation for younger babies is because of their rapid development, experts say. But it's also because there is an assumption being made that most infants' first solids will be foods like iron-fortified cereals, as well as fruits and vegetables – non-heme sources of iron, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/iron/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;which the body absorbs less readily&lt;/a&gt; than heme sources, which are animal-derived, like meat, fish and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Diet is the best approach. Your body tends to take it up better. Your body tends to use it better," Corkins says. "Now, if someone is profoundly anaemic, and you're trying to get them fixed faster – then you do supplementation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As for Ryan, she was able to correct her iron deficiency both times it happened: in pregnancy, with a supplement, and in 2023, with iron infusions, administered at her hospital, every two weeks for five months.

(His responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="is-the-us-prepared-for-another-pandemic"&gt;Is the U.S. prepared for another pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We are better prepared than we were five years ago. We are not as prepared as we need to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Preparedness is always an ongoing exercise. The U.S. military thinks a lot about preparedness, and they're constantly exercising, they're constantly updating. We need to have a very similar approach to thinking about health crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next one may be a natural pandemic. The next one may be a biological agent that's been man-made. We have got to be keeping on our toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-has-improved-since-the-start-of-the-covid-19-pandemic--and-what-needs-to-improve"&gt;What has improved since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic — and what needs to improve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We have a pretty good wastewater surveillance system that can help us track the spread of viruses around the country in a way we did not five years ago; we built that. Now a majority of communities are tracking various viruses using wastewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What could be better is that we could expand that to more communities. We've got a majority, but we don't have everybody, and we could do that better. What I worry about is that that's going to get pulled back. A lot of that came originally from funding for COVID, and the current administration and their effort to cut everything may end up destroying our surveillance system, and that would be very, very bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The second thing that I think is better is we obviously have learned how to build vaccines very quickly. I think Operation Warp Speed was a huge success that taught us a lot about how to move vaccines forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I worry a lot about this administration's commitment to vaccines, even though ironically it was President Trump who brought us Operation Warp Speed. But obviously we have a health secretary who undermines vaccines at every step. I think that the big challenge is: Are we going to be able to continue investing in a new generation of vaccines or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A third area where I think we made a lot of progress that makes us better is if we get a major threat, we have learned how we can build up treatments quickly, particularly monoclonal antibodies. We built those very rapidly during COVID. They're going to be essential for the next pandemic, and we have to make sure we are investing in that platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-there-any-foreseeable-challenges-the-us-could-face-ahead-of-another-pandemic"&gt;Are there any foreseeable challenges the U.S. could face ahead of another pandemic?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Where I worry we may be worse off than we were five years ago is the sort of confidence in the scientific process. There has been such an active undermining of public health, of overplaying every mistake in public health. Now let's be clear, public health officials, public health experts didn't get it all right, we made mistakes, all of us did, and there is an active campaign to find every error, every mistake, and amplify it to try to discredit the entire public health enterprise. That means that if there is another crisis, it's going to be very hard to build confidence in a science-based response. We've got a lot of work to do between now and whenever that next crisis happens to try to build up that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="should-we-be-worried-about-bird-flu"&gt;Should we be worried about bird flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bird flu has been something that a lot of us have been worried about for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's a virus that has a very high fatality rate. In the literature, about half the people who've gotten infected have died. That is obviously extraordinarily high, and we've all worried about it. We've always hoped that we would never see the day where we see a bird flu pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, I think what we've seen in the last couple of years is things kind of moving in the wrong direction. It used to be that we almost never saw mammal populations getting infected. It was almost all largely among birds with the occasional spillover to people. Now we've seen large mammal die-offs. We've seen cows get infected. Obviously, the spread among birds is very large, and all of this is just substantially increasing the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So I think none of us knows if we're going to see a bird flu pandemic in three months, three years or 30 years. ... But the risk of it is very different now than it was five years ago, than even two years ago. When I say 'different,' I mean much higher, and we've got to start preparing with the concern that it might happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-about-measles"&gt;How about measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The problem is that if vaccination rates fall below 95% in the community, that community starts becoming vulnerable to the spread of measles. Let's say somebody who's unvaccinated comes from traveling abroad, brings measles back home or increasingly just gets it here, and if they go to a community with an 80% or 85% vaccination rate, you're going to start seeing an outbreak because it's so contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Obviously, people who are not vaccinated are at risk. But I want to remind us that there are many people who are not vaccinated who wish they could be. You have immunocompromised kids who might be undergoing cancer therapy. They can't get the vaccine, and they rely on everybody around them being vaccinated to protect them. If you're in a community with low vaccination rates, those kids are very vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Second is that the first dose of the measles vaccine isn't given until 12 to 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the CDC recommends that parents don't travel to areas of measles outbreaks with kids less than 1 year of age until they've had their first shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Well, that's a problem if the outbreak is in the community where you live. So you may be a parent who's very committed to protecting your kids with vaccines, but you have a 4-month-old who can't get a vaccine yet. And that kid is vulnerable if they get measles, and they can get quite sick, and there's not much you can do about it, obviously, except avoiding being in contact with people with measles. But it's so contagious that you can't even reliably do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 09:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOT01aSldwc1ZQbnJPS0lwSWNqSEF1UGJOSzBWZmF0X3RMMTZwLW9SdElndVEyNGxMeHVPQlRMLTZvcXdZbEZFcHA2NGp2dzVLVnlnUGNpT0x3VlFYRXJCbmFlQmFuQ20wV04wNEotSGJ1WTYyeTRZXzE2Rk1Iclg1UWtZNlRGWnRZ</guid></item><item><title>Experts Warn Against Slushies For Kids, After UK Hospitalizations - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQZWNmUG1ud1NPWEFvVGFrMWFHR0lVa3ZTTEhIb3Z2cVVBd0VMdnNRTFRyTll0U2RicEJHRE5RT18yVWlmMWc0bjFOM1Bwbl84Wll4QUlIRFV2ekJtUzd5a0xRajFaNWswODlLbmZhLXFKVzhwbHVROUU1VjZIby04Y0xHdGxtb2tZOUZNNVIxSG9pM3VQT1hQVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Children under eight should not drink slushy ice drinks containing glycerol, researchers have warned after a string of hospitalisations in the UK and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brightly coloured drinks marketed towards children often use glycerol as a sweetener and anti-freezing agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But high levels can be harmful, especially to children – glycerol intoxication can cause shock, low blood sugar and loss of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/consciousness" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73104" data-postid="154838" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a peer-reviewed medical review published in the &lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2025/02/10/archdischild-2024-328109"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archives of Disease in Childhood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; journal on Tuesday, researchers looked into a "recent apparent surge in cases" in the UK and Ireland, and suggested children under eight should avoid the drinks entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642.jpg" alt="slushy machine" class="wp-image-154858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/slushy_machine_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Glycerol is sometimes added to icy drinks to keep them from freezing solid. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC9doJlv_s/"&gt;dnberty/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They studied the medical records of 21 children aged two to seven who needed emergency treatment after drinking slushies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cases took place between 2018 and 2024 and many of the children became acutely ill within an hour, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the children lost consciousness and showed signs of high blood acidity and low sugar, while four needed brain scans and one had a seizure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The children all recovered swiftly, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slushy machines were invented in the United States in the 1950s, and the drinks do not always contain glycerol because sugar can be used to stop them freezing solid instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested the spate of cases could be linked to increased concern about high sugar consumption and sugar taxes adopted in the UK and Ireland in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food safety agencies in the two countries already advise that children aged four and under should not have slushies containing glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the researchers said the age should be raised further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol," &lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/early/2025/02/10/archdischild-2024-328109"&gt;they said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review's authors also said there could be cases where children have suffered less serious illness and not been taken to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, some parents said they supported raising the recommended age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mother Elsa Qorri, 46, told AFP she became worried after her two girls aged five and seven drank slushies last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They both got brain freeze and couldn't have any more," she said. "I'm not going to buy them again until the girls are a little bit older."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Being married triples the risk of men becoming obese, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chance of piling on the pounds increased for both sexes after marriage, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women's risk of being overweight was 39% higher - and men's 62% - compared with unmarried couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But married men were 3.2 times more likely to be classed as technically obese than their unmarried counterparts, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding wasn't mirrored in females, which the Polish researchers said could be because women who are obese "are more often stigmatised" by society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Alicja Cicha-Mikolajczyk, from Warsaw's National Institute of Cardiology, suggested women "cannot accept living with obesity" and are more likely to take action to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the NHS generally classes obese people as having a body mass index (BMI) of above 30, and being overweight is associated with a BMI of 25-30.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;However, the measure (which looks only at height and weight) has been criticised by some as over simplistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study - which looked at 2,405 Polish people, typically aged 50 - also found getting older increased the risk of becoming heavier in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;        
    
&lt;p&gt;Each extra year increased the risk of being overweight by 3% in men and 4% in women; and the risk of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/obesity-7171/1" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by 4% in men and 6% in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression or poor health knowledge also had a significant impact on the risk of women becoming obese - but this wasn't found in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more from Sky News:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/norwegian-ski-jumpers-suspended-in-cheating-scandal-over-modified-suits-13327349" target="_blank"&gt;Ski jumpers suspended over modified suits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/pakistan-hostages-killed-after-separatist-militants-hijack-train-carrying-hundreds-of-passengers-13326922" target="_blank"&gt;Hostages killed after militants hijack train&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team concluded: "Age and marital status have undeniable impact on living with overweight or obesity in adulthood regardless of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In turn, inadequate health literacy and having at least borderline depression were associated with obesity in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It appears from our results that the dissemination of health knowledge and health promotion across the lifespan could reduce the worrying phenomenon of increasing levels of obesity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings will be presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Spain in May.&lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3p2u000v25p84zmq7px0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases in the ongoing measles outbreak have risen to 258 across Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and state health departments are urging more people to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00023b5vqs67xs0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that “people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves. And what we need to do is give them the best information and encourage them to vaccinate. The vaccine does stop the spread of the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000g3b5vav88tonm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Kennedy also downplayed the safety of the vaccine and wrongly told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that measles outbreaks could be driven in part by people who have waning immunity from the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00053b5v0v5kz16s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you and I were kids, everybody got measles, and measles gave you … lifetime protection against measles infection. The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people, it wanes,” Kennedy told Hannity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000h3b5vxwevrnfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some years, we have hundreds of these outbreaks. … And, you know, part of that is that there are people who don’t vaccinate, but also the vaccine itself wanes. The vaccine wanes 4.5% per year,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000i3b5v3z5d4ls8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, says that if that were the case, measles wouldn’t have been declared eliminated in the US in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000j3b5vo28cp0c5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s some dispute among experts about how much protection may wane, if at all. However, they all agree that in most cases, the vaccine confers lifelong immunity against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000k3b5vfzpe8mrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current outbreak “is absolutely being driven and started by unvaccinated individuals,” said Dr. Michael Mina, chief scientific officer of the telehealth company eMed and an expert in the epidemiology, immunology and spread of infectious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000l3b5vcnumhxex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even those who may have waning immunity will not transmit large amounts of virus, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000n3b5vu7qf6jqq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Levels of antibodies created by the vaccine might decrease over time, but with a virus like measles, its longer incubation period gives the body’s immune memory cells more time to help fight the infection. This enables long-lasting immunity from vaccination, Offit explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000o3b5v4h6ba485@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since measles was declared eliminated in the US, there have been an average of about 179 cases reported each year, many of them related to international travel. There have been an average of about eight outbreaks per year – ranging from 1 to 25 annually – and most years, at least 60% of all reported cases have been tied to outbreaks. But even the worst outbreaks typically stay under 50 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86g9olv00023b6mxzc4gjla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is only the fifth year since 2000 that an outbreak has led to more than 100 cases and only the third year with more than 200 cases. The others were 2014, with an outbreak tied to Disneyland, and 2019, when a nearly year-long &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;outbreak in New York came&lt;/a&gt; within weeks of ending the nation’s elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00043b5vh4511r14@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some of Kennedy’s statements promoted natural immunity, acquired when someone gets measles, over vaccine induced immunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00063b5va3ru8iqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles. People who were naturally infected with measles will also have immunity, but not without serious risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00083b5vntjmvb6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal of a vaccine is to induce the immunity that is a consequence of natural infection without paying the price of natural infection,” Offit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq00093b5vt0ttubit@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The price of infection can be high: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Encephalitis.,deaf%20or%20with%20intellectual%20disability." target="_blank"&gt;One in five&lt;/a&gt; unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis or swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000a3b5v2gwpstk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One to three in 1,000 children who have measles will die from complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. A school-age child who was not vaccinated is among the two deaths that have already been associated with the ongoing measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000b3b5vbwnrlb9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another possible consequence of infection is “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/health/measles-amnesia-study-intl-hnk-scli-scn/index.html"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;.” When the measles virus infects immune cells, it can erase the body’s memory of how to fight other infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000c3b5v8d7lomlf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So if you want to take the natural immunity route … you’re destroying your previously existing immune memory and putting yourself at risk for every other infection that you could get. And so there is no world in which measles is good for the body, and there’s no world in which getting measles infection is better than getting a measles vaccine,” Mina said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000d3b5vvmg0itxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also inaccurately said vaccine-induced immunity may not be passed through breast milk to nursing infants the way natural immunity is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trq000e3b5vo9dpuopq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He is wrong. Maternal antibody transfer is a key form of neonatal protection against infectious diseases,” said Dr. Lynn Yee, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine. “Even when a mother had vaccination many years ago, antibodies still transfer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f6gni001b3b5vqrw4t065@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is especially important because infants can get protection against the virus through antibodies from their mother in the first six months of life, when they are too young to be vaccinated, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86f3trr000q3b5vlis2ldbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also incorrectly described adverse events from the MMR vaccine, saying it “causes deaths every year. … It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes: encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86h84sf00053b5vufashffu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, called this “disinformation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86i7fzb000r3b6m5x054zpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The measles vaccine is incredibly safe,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “This is what anti-vaccine activists do is, they play up and try to scare you with the very, very rare side effects and forget to tell you about the horrific effects of the illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm86fiw6100003b5vq5g5pbyc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles infection can cause encephalitis and blindness, but only a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; of these kinds of illnesses related to vaccination have ever been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4599698/pdf/nihms724114.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in which the US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC reviewed reports from the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System, in addition to medical records, death certificates, and autopsy reports, did not find evidence to suggest “a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The MMR vaccine is extremely safe. The most common side effects that people may get is the low-grade fever for a few days, and sometimes people can get this temporary rash It usually resolves within 24 to 48 hours. Those are by far the most common symptoms, and there are a few more that are much less common, but they are extremely rare,” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            More serious side effects from vaccination are extremely rare, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.

            “All of those [common side effects] are signs that the vaccine is working and your immune system is mounting the responses it’s supposed to to gain memory to protect you later. But many folks are touting these as significant adverse events, and so I think that the devil is really in the details on this,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.

by then she had tried six different contraceptive pills to find a way of helping her pain, but nothing seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I came off the pill and that's when my periods became absolutely, completely unmanageable. They took over my life. I wasn't going to university, I wasn't going to work," Ami says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If I was going to work, I was collapsing in pain consistently every single month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ami kept going back to her GP because the pain was "completely unbearable".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was just so desperate, my mental health was on the floor. I don't even know how I survived. It was like 20 to 25 days out of the month where I was just completely bed-bound," she told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ami had her first surgery in October 2021, which reduced the pain for seven or eight months, but then it gradually came back. A second operation in April 2024  was not as successful. She is now trying to raise enough money to have a third surgery, privately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ami says it is good to hear that further treatment is being developed for endometriosis because "a lot of the time it feels like you're being left in the dark".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Usually, the first treatments for endometriosis, after pain relievers, are hormone injections which temporarily shut down the body's production of estrogen. This is the hormone that causes endometriosis tissue to grow and cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, patients often need to travel to hospitals to have the injections, which last for up to three months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;With the new all-in-one tablet, there is no need for patients to remember to take hormone replacement therapy as a separate tablet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It can be stopped quickly if side effects are difficult and taken up until the menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a step forward and will give patients more choice, but it will impact a relatively small number of people," says Emma Cox, chief executive of Endometriosis UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We need to see more investment in other research and treatments," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The treatment will cost £72 for a 28-day supply, NICE said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 00:43:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE41cVRlSlhBRHo5Y0Eza05JdF9vSHdvbmpxOTZlWjk2Z1BDQWgzLWlhTUVVX2tMZ2RZdXhURHdJbHFBdTNBTnJLd3BxOXlWWVdDcVVUeW1kNnFiZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFAzbWhJNm0wQzJqRmladTlKbjVuUHZYODZtVlh4OW1BWC1aRm9xVEdtUlNXc2Z0cTlZaUE3TG1ESEFtU1BEQ19zQmZEOEJwWXJhbjFXbFQ4Q3hDM0ttWE13</guid></item><item><title>Millennials Were Raised As The 'Always On' Generation — 'Honestly, We Have Nothing Left To Give' - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFBRcndzWXlzRzJDYXYyWXN4MDYwNHRsX3VDUGZTT3JCcFNIa3FhNmw4SkxBWUdnY3BNNnhpdC1wcDQ5SnJxeVhYQzRsV3FxS3RuOUxtX2FnNzhxWHNqemFMLVpDN0c0bDhZWVRGWE95NFBsSHhhMjFuR0F3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="46a0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;In a hyper-connected world where technology is deeply intertwined with our daily lives, the boundaries between work and personal life have become increasingly blurred.

It's work that's particularly relevant as a measles outbreak grips the Southwest amidst diminishing vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, scientists around the country have begun receiving letters stating their existing grants — money already awarded to them in a competitive process — were being cut.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, the cuts appeared to primarily target research on LGBTQ+ health and other areas that were deemed in conflict with President Trump's executive orders on gender and "diversity, equity and inclusion."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now, more than 40 grants related to vaccine hesitancy have been cancelled, and there are mounting concerns that research on mRNA vaccines could be on the chopping block next.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR obtained information about the changes from two NIH staffers and one person familiar with NIH's activities who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. And, NPR reviewed emails and documents they provided.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I want to underscore just how unprecedented — how abnormal all of this is," one longtime NIH official told NPR. "This is not how we operate."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;An email circulated among NIH leadership this week included a list of grants that were to be terminated and details on the specific language to use in those notices. "It is the policy of NIH not to prioritize research activities that focuses gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment," the email states.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear exactly how many grants have been cancelled in total under the Trump administration. Neither the NIH nor its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, replied to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It appears that there are forces intent on destroying our existing vaccine enterprise," says &lt;a href="https://www.fammed.wisc.edu/directory/286/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Temte&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of family medicine at the University of Wisconsin who studies vaccine hesitancy. "Defunding research on vaccine hesitancy is the latest example of this effort."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;mRNA research may be at risk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In what some at the agency view as an ominous sign, the NIH's acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli also requested information last week about the funding that supports mRNA vaccine research, technology that underpins the COVID-19 shots from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, according to an email reviewed by NPR. A similar call for data preceded the termination of the other vaccine grants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"NIH staff internally are very worried that the mRNA grants will follow the outcome of the vaccine hesitancy grants and be terminated," according to one of the NIH employees who wasn't authorized to speak publicly. "There are widespread concerns that this will limit the ability to combat pandemics and halt promising lifesaving cancer treatments."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reviewed the NIH list of 130 of these awards issued by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, which funds the most mRNA research. This includes efforts to develop vaccines for a variety of diseases, including Lyme disease, dengue and a sometimes life-threatening gastrointestinal infection known as &lt;em&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other parts of the NIH like the National Cancer Institute also fund this work, because mRNA technology holds promise for targeted cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am on pins and needles constantly," says &lt;a href="https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/microbiology/profiles/richner-justin/" target="_blank"&gt;Justin Richner&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Illinois, Chicago. "I'm really kind of waiting for the shoe to drop in terms of looking for the email saying the grant has been canceled."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Richner's $1 million, 4-year NIH grant is on the agency's internal list. His lab is working to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect against dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is spreading in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's an outrageous incursion on the way in which the NIH is managing the money that's been appropriated by Congress," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://vivo.weill.cornell.edu/display/cwid-varmus" target="_blank"&gt;Harold Varmus&lt;/a&gt;, a Nobel Prize winning professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College who ran the NIH from 1993 to 1999. "The idea that we're going to turn one of the most prestigious aspects of federally supported activities into a graveyard is very troubling to everybody."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.uiowa.edu/internalmedicine/profile/aaron-scherer" target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Scherer&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Iowa who studies vaccine hesitancy, says his grants are not canceled as far as he knows, but given what's happening, he assumes that NIH will not be funding his future proposal "regardless of its scientific and health merits."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Health disparities and LGBTQ+ research loses ground&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine research is just the latest target in the Trump administration's expanding effort to cut off NIH-funded researchers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A first wave of letters went out last month to researchers notifying them their grants were being canceled because they did not fit with President Trump's executive orders.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Letters of termination reviewed by NPR state "no modification of the project could align the project with agency priorities," but a current NIH employee told NPR that the scientific staff at their institute who would be responsible for making that determination are not being consulted. "They're not checking with us," said the person, adding that these termination decisions are coming with virtually no notice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;According to an internal memo, NIH staff were directed to separate awards into different categories depending, for example, on whether the "sole purpose of the project is DEI related" or could still be viable if modified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidance also has implications for hundreds of awards in the coming months, because many "Notices of Funding Opportunities" have been taken down, and grants that applied through those notices will not get their funding, either, the NIH staffer told NPR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/brittany-charlton/" target="_blank"&gt;Brittany Charlton&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the LGBTQ Health Center of Excellence at Harvard University, says she's tallied two dozen awards that have been terminated among her colleagues for work that touches on issues like HIV prevention and Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The cuts are not only affecting research on the LGBTQ+ population but also other vulnerable communities, she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not studying fringe issues, and they're not at all ideological either,"  Charlton says, "The research that's being abruptly terminated by the federal government right now is really meant to identify what underlies some of these disparities and help to address them."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The good and the bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterollevelswhatyouneedtoknow.html"&gt;For reference&lt;/a&gt;, the optimal LDL level for adults is less than 100 mg/dL, and optimal HDL is 60 mg/dL or higher. Higher LDL levels can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and other health problems, while higher HDL has a protective effect against cardiovascular disease. Though some of the changes reported in the study were small, the researchers note that they could be meaningful in some cases. For instance, an increase of 5 mg/dL in LDL is enough to raise the risk of a cardiovascular event by 2 percent to 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers ran three different models to adjust for a variety of factors, including basics like age, sex, body mass index, as well as medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, and lifestyle factors, such as exercise, dietary habits, and smoking. All the models showed the same associations. They also broke out the data by what kinds of alcohol people reported drinking—wine, beer, sake, other liquors and spirits. The results were the same across the categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study isn't the first to find good news for drinkers' cholesterol levels, though it's one of the larger studies with longer follow-up time. And it's long been found that alcohol drinking seems to have some benefits for cardiovascular health. &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/28582/review-of-evidence-on-alcohol-and-health"&gt;A recent review and meta-analysis by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that moderate drinkers had lower relative risks of heart attacks and strokes. The analysis also found that drinkers had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (death by any cause). The study did, however, find increased risks of breast cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.stopalcoholabuse.gov/media/pdf/Report-on-Alcohol-Intake-and-Health.pdf"&gt;Another recent review&lt;/a&gt; found increased risk of colorectal, female breast, liver, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, the new cholesterol findings aren't an invitation for nondrinkers to start drinking or for heavy drinkers to keep hitting the bottle hard, the researchers caution. There are a lot of other risks to consider. For drinkers who aren't interested in quitting, the researchers recommend taking it easy. And those who do want to quit should keep a careful eye on their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their words: "Public health recommendations should continue to emphasize moderation in alcohol consumption, but cholesterol levels should be carefully monitored after alcohol cessation to mitigate potential [cardiovascular disease] risks," the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain. The first study of its kind in twins found that taking daily protein and prebiotic supplements can improve scores on memory tests in people over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published last year, are food for thought, especially as the same visual memory and learning test is used to detect early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154573" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded trial involved two cheap plant fiber prebiotics that are available over the counter in numerous nations around the world. Prebiotics are non-digestible consumables that help stimulate our gut microbes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;, and it is a dietary fiber in the class fructan. Another is called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"&gt;fructooligosaccharide&lt;/a&gt; (FOS), and it is a plant carbohydrate often used as a natural low calorie sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144930" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642.jpg" alt="Aerial view of a cup of tea next to sachets of sweetener" class="size-full wp-image-144930" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LowCalorieSweetenerCupOfTea642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144930" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Fructooligosaccharide is often used as a natural low calorie sweetener. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFb-9YB388/"&gt;towfiqu barbhuiya/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of these supplements on the aging brain, researchers at King's College London enrolled 36 pairs of twins over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each duo was randomly split so that one twin was assigned a daily prebiotic in a protein powder and the other was assigned a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="154573" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in a protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin who unknowingly took inulin or FOS generally scored higher on a cognitive test three months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins. The beneficial &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925/full"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, were more plentiful in twins taking inulin or FOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg" alt="Illustration of bacteria in the gut" class="size-full wp-image-144933" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/GutBacteriaMicrobiome642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144933" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins.

&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks. This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Mary Ni Lochlainn, a geriatric medicine researcher at King's College London, when the findings were published in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlocking the secrets of the gut-brain axis could offer new approaches for living more healthily for longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uXEf1Xfh1bY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King's College is home to the United Kingdom's largest adult twin registry, and twin studies are highly valuable when it comes to differentiating between the effect of genetics and the environment on human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/77/2/81/5237462?login=false#127953545"&gt;Past studies on rodents&lt;/a&gt; suggest that high-fiber supplements, like inulin and FOS, can 'feed' the colon's microbiome, allowing 'good' bacteria to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these bacterial players are &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.3c00652"&gt;also linked&lt;/a&gt; to improved cognitive function in both mice and &lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad200488"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144937" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144937" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642.jpg" alt="Twin sisters smiling with arms around each other" class="size-full wp-image-144937" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/TwinsSmiling642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144937" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Twin studies are highly valuable when it comes to differentiating between the effect of genetics and the environment on human health.

Some experts are now so convinced by the results, they &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news-events/publications-archive/brain/gut-brain"&gt;refer to the gut&lt;/a&gt; as the body's 'second brain'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way these two nervous systems work together remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent twin study at KCL suggests that consuming certain 'brain foods' may be a promising way to treat cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while prebiotics might improve some aspects of cognitive function in an aging brain, like memory and processing times, there don't appear to be significant physical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscle loss didn't improve among aging twins taking high-fiber supplements, despite the fact that inulin and FOS are important factors in musculoskeletal maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These plant fibers, which are cheap and available over the counter, could benefit a wide group of people in these cash-strapped times. They are safe and acceptable too," &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/daily-fibre-supplement-improves-older-brain-12-weeks"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; geriatrician Claire Steves at KCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our next task is to see whether these effects are sustained over longer periods and in larger groups of people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144939" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg" alt="Senior couple completing a jigsaw" class="size-full wp-image-144939" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderAdultsSmilingDoingJigsawAlzheimers642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144939" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain.

&lt;p&gt;That said, females are more susceptible to Alzheimer's disease, and studies like the current one support the emerging idea that cognitive decline is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-reveals"&gt;not always a disease of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, but may involve external factors, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gut has its fingers in many bodily 'pies', including the immune system and the central nervous system. Feeding its microbiome certain &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410452/"&gt;prebiotics and probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could open the door to treating a plethora of illnesses and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in March 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

						The Pennsylvania Department of Health and Philadelphia Department of Health are notifying the public about a potential measles exposure at two locations.South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy CenterThis building includes CHOP Pediatric Primary Care South Philadelphia, Health Department Health Center #2, and the South Philadelphia Library, though there were no potential exposures in the library.1700 South Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA 19145Friday, March 7 between 10:45 a.m. and 2:40 p.m.Saturday, March 8, between 9:05 a.m. and 1:20 p.m.CHOP Emergency Department3401 Civic Center Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA, 19104Monday, March 10, 2025, 7:55 a.m. to 10:15 a.m.The infected person was exposed while traveling abroad, according to health officials. It is not connected to the recent measles case in Montgomery County or cases in other parts of the country.What to doIf you were potentially exposed, follow these instructions from the health department:Determine if you are protected against measles. Generally, you are considered protected if you:Were born before 1957, orHave already had measles, orHave a blood test showing immunity to measles, orHave written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR vaccine)Look at your vaccination records or ask your health care provider to see if you have already had the age-appropriate dose or doses of this vaccine.Measles vaccine is routinely recommended for children 12–15 months old with a second dose given at age 4–6 years. Infants under 12 months are not routinely eligible for vaccine and are not protected.If you are protected from measles, you do not have to do anything. The vaccine is extremely effective at preventing measles.If you are not protected from measles, there are things you can do to keep yourself and others safe.If you were at the CHOP Emergency Department on March 10 during the times listed above, you should receive a dose of MMR vaccine before March 13. Talk to your health care provider to learn how you can get this vaccine. The health department has additional resources on where to get vaccines on its website. If you do not receive an MMR vaccine, you will need to stay home for 21 days.If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 7 during the times listed above, you should contact your health care provider and stay at home until March 27. Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms.If you were at the South Philadelphia Health &amp;amp; Literacy Center on March 8 during the times listed above, you should contact your health care provider and stay at home until March 28. Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms.If you develop any measles-like symptoms through March 31, contact your doctor immediately. The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by a rash.Tell your doctor before visiting that you may have been exposed to measles.You should also notify the Philadelphia Department of Public Health by calling 215-685-6740, then pressing option 5.About measlesMeasles is a virus that spreads very easily from person to person among unvaccinated people. Anyone with measles can spread the virus to others who are not immune through direct contact with respiratory droplets, or through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing.The early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, cough, and puffy eyes, followed by rash. Measles is contagious for four days before to four days after the rash starts.In some people, including infants and those with weakened immune systems, it can be a very serious infection that leads to pneumonia, brain infection or death.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunburns and aging skin are obvious effects of exposure to harmful UV rays, tobacco smoke and other carcinogens. But the effects aren't just skin deep. Inside the body, DNA is literally being torn apart.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the body heals and protects itself from DNA damage is vital for treating genetic disorders and life-threatening diseases such as cancer. But despite numerous studies and medical advances, much about the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, researchers at Georgia State University have tapped into the Summit supercomputer at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory to study an elaborate molecular pathway called &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/nucleotide+excision+repair/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nucleotide excision repair&lt;/a&gt; (NER). NER relies on an array of highly dynamic protein complexes to cut out (excise) damaged DNA with surgical precision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their latest study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52860-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, the team has built a computer model of a critical NER component called the pre-incision complex, or PInC. PInC plays a key role in regulating DNA repair processes in the latter stages of the NER pathway. Decoding NER's sophisticated sequence of events and the role of PInC in the pathway could provide key insights into developing novel treatments and preventing conditions that lead to premature aging and certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're interested in the way cells repair their genetic material," said lead investigator Ivaylo Ivanov, a chemistry professor at Georgia State University. "NER is a versatile pathway that repairs all kinds of different DNA damage using a three-stage process that relies on delicately balanced molecular machinery. Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/harmful+mutations/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;harmful mutations&lt;/a&gt; can develop that interfere with this machinery and cause severe human diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet, the effects of genetic mutations can be strikingly different depending on their positions within the repair complexes. In some cases, mutations result in patients having UV light sensitivity and an extreme cancer predisposition. In other cases, they cause abnormal development and premature aging," he said. "Why that happens is not completely understood at the molecular level. That's the mystery our computer modeling efforts aim to unravel."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;The three acts of repair&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NER unfolds in three distinct stages: recognition, verification and repair. Each stage requires different groups of proteins to perform specific functions, much like a trauma team has different specialists needed to treat injured patients in the emergency room. In that way, the NER machinery can adapt and change its shape depending on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first stage, the NER protein XPC (xeroderma pigmentosum group C) acts like a first responder that locates the site of the damaged DNA, or lesion, and then twists the DNA helix to make the damage accessible. XPC then calls in other repair proteins to help initiate the second stage, called damage verification, or lesion scanning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the NER protein machinery shifts into its next shape. As XPC steps back, the protein complex called transcription factor IIH, or TFIIH (pronounced T-F-2-H), moves into position. TFIIH further unwinds the section of DNA and scans the newly exposed strand for lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, it's in the hands of the surgeon—the PInC—in the third and final stage of repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the "patient" stabilized and prepped for surgery, the operation to remove the damaged DNA strand can begin. Two enzymes, XPF and XPG (xeroderma pigmentosum groups F and G), position themselves precisely on each side of the lesion and act as molecular scissors to cut out the damaged segment of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the lesion is removed, new DNA is synthesized to fill in the gap left behind. Finally, the DNA backbone is sealed, and the damaged DNA is restored back to health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we want to know is how the PInC forms after the lesion scanning phase," Ivanov said. "How does it control the positioning of the two enzyme subunits that perform the dual incision of the damaged DNA strand? And importantly, is there any cross talk between the two enzymes? Do they sense each other?"&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"That matters because once the damaged DNA strand is cleaved, it's vital that the repair process is completed by filling in that gap," he added. "Otherwise, it will lead to cell death or to the introduction of double-stranded breaks, which are extremely harmful to the cell."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering those questions required the researchers to solve the structure of the PInC. In biology, understanding protein structure is essential for understanding the behavior or function of protein assemblies. The shapes, sizes and interactions of proteins determine how they fit together to form large biomolecular assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We integrated the structural model of PInC using data from a variety of biophysical techniques, notably cryo-electron microscopy," Ivanov said. "But in the end, the computation is what puts everything together."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the PInC model had to be assembled from known structures of constituent proteins, and all the individual pieces had to be put together in 3D. However, many of the PInC components had no known experimental structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this challenge, the researchers used a neural network-based model called AlphaFold2 to predict the unknown structures and the interfaces between the proteins that hold PInC together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summit's final simulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Computationally, once you assemble the PInC, molecular dynamics simulations of the complex become relatively straightforward, especially on large supercomputers like Summit," Ivanov said.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics, or NAMD, is a molecular dynamics code specifically designed for supercomputers and is used to simulate the movements and interactions of large biomolecular systems that contain millions of atoms. Using NAMD, the research team ran extensive simulations. The number-crunching power of the 200-petaflop Summit supercomputer—capable of performing 200,000 trillion calculations per second—was essential in unraveling the functional dynamics of the PInC complex on a timescale of microseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The simulations showed us a lot about the complex nature of the PInC machinery. It showed us how these different components move together as modules and the subdivision of this complex into dynamic communities, which form the moving parts of this machine," Ivanov said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are significant in that mutations in XPF and XPG can lead to severe human genetic disorders. They include xeroderma pigmentosum, which is a condition that makes people more susceptible to skin cancer, and Cockayne syndrome, which can affect human growth and development, lead to impaired hearing and vision, and speed up the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Simulations allow us to zero in on these important regions because mutations that interfere with the function of the NER complex often occur at community interfaces, which are the most dynamic regions of the machine," Ivanov said. "Now we have a much better understanding of how and from where these disorders manifest."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the molecular dynamics simulations were performed on Summit. However, after 6 years of production, Summit was retired at the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Ivanov and his team plan to use Summit's successor, Frontier, the exascale-class supercomputer that debuted as the world's most powerful supercomputer when it came online in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work on Frontier will involve examining transcription-coupled NER, which is a DNA repair process that fixes damage in actively transcribed genes to ensure that essential proteins can continue being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Ivanov, the research team includes Jina Yu, Chunli Yan, Tanmoy Paul and Lucas Brewer at Georgia State University; Susan E. Tsutakawa and John A. Tainer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Chi-Lin Tsai at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center; and Samir M. Hamdan at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

The study underscores that dementia and cognitive decline share risk factors with heart disease, suggesting these conditions are largely preventable by managing diet, exercise, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following guidelines such as the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8—eight essential behaviors to improve cardiovascular and brain health—can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia. Experts argue that integrating these heart-healthy habits into everyday life offers a practical strategy for reducing the growing global burden of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Risk Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Dementia and heart disease share common modifiable risk factors, such as diet, blood pressure, and cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising Burden:&lt;/strong&gt; Globally, dementia cases have risen 160% since 1990, outpacing cardiovascular disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventative Strategies:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopting the American Heart Association’s “Life Essential 8” could significantly protect brain health and reduce dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AHA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average adult brain only weighs about 3 pounds, yet it is one of the most complex and vital organs of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognition may decline and our brains become prone to disease as we age, so as medical advances and other factors help the world’s population live longer the prevalence of brain disease, including dementia, is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, keeping our brains healthy may be easier than people realize with some helpful guidance from the American Heart Association, a global force changing the future of health of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108135"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain in the shape of a heart." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/brain-heart-longevity-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Elkind said following the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8™ can be as beneficial for brain health as it is for heart health. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimal brain health includes the functional ability to perform all the diverse tasks for which the brain is responsible – including thinking, moving and feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many modifiable risk factors for cognitive loss, such as an unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle, develop as early as childhood and adolescence. As we age, our ability to remember, problem-solve, think and communicate decreases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now know that many of the same health risk factors that cause heart disease and stroke also contribute to a decline in overall brain health,” said Mitchell S. V. Elkind, M.D., M.S., FAHA, a neurologist and former volunteer American Heart Association president and currently its chief clinical science officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just like with heart disease and stroke, most brain disease is preventable. However, the combination of an aging population and projected substantial increases in high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes are likely to lead to unprecedented growth in many types of brain disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data reported in the &lt;em&gt;2025 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics: A Report of U.S. and Global Data From the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; leading cause of death in the U.S. and the leading cause of death among all neurological disorders, including stroke.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More females than males die of dementia each year because of the higher prevalence of elderly females compared with males. Females accounted for 66.7% of U.S. dementia deaths in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 6.9 million people in the U.S. are living with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An analysis of Medicare data reported in the update estimates that prevalence will more than double to 13.9 million Americans by 2060.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also reported in the statistical update:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Worldwide, nearly 57 million people had Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in 2021, a 45% increase since 2010 and a 160% increase over the past 30 years (1990-2021). For comparison, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease increased 33% over the past decade and 111% over the past 30 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The increase in global deaths from Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias is outpacing that of cardiovascular disease even more – dementia deaths increased by nearly 195% since 1990, compared to a 57% increase in cardiovascular deaths during that same time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Estimated U.S. healthcare spending on dementia more than doubled from $38.6 billion in 1996 to $79.2 billion in 2016. Spending on dementias was among the top 10 healthcare costs in the United States in 2016.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The burden of brain disorders is high. Dementia as a cause of death is growing faster than any other disease, including heart disease, the number one cause of death worldwide. Paradoxically, as we get better at treating other conditions, like heart disease, stroke and cancer, dementia as a cause of death increases,” Elkind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using many of the same tools and information that have helped us successfully address cardiovascular risk factors and reduce the burden of heart disease over the past several decades, we should be able to do the same for brain disorders and promote brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elkind said following the American Heart Association’s Life Essential 8™ can be as beneficial for brain health as it is for heart health. These include 4 health behaviors and 4 health factors identified as key measures for improving and maintaining cardiovascular health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Eat Better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Be More Active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Quit Tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Behaviors: Get Healthy Sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Control Cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Blood Sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health Factors: Manage Blood Pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The American Heart Association is committed to advancing brain science through innovative research that will help scientists shed new light on the causes and contributors to cognitive impairment and dementia, particularly as it relates to heart and vascular health,” Elkind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we can support individuals and communities in thinking of brain health not only in terms of an absence of disease, but also in a more positive way. We can look at how we optimize brain function to include positive cognitive traits like creativity, adaptability, resilience, empathy and others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the increasing cost of poor brain health in lives and dollars makes the Association’s ongoing commitment to better understand how brains age and how vascular health impacts brain health and overall well-being even more imperative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people are asked what health conditions they fear the most with aging, dementia tops the list, surpassing even cancer, heart disease and stroke,” Elkind said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s critical that as a society and as individuals we understand and make the changes needed to improve health outcomes from brain disease and, more importantly, prevent them to begin with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain health and longevity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1172706579683f7d746678625179747063653f7e6376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cathy Lewis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://heart.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Cathy Lewis – AHA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:20:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9UTEV0TklkUFY4NHJXWXRqanpzNHdkWnZJTjhWVjhkTFh3NEtvQ0FxbmRCd2ZHcnVkbWFIYzI3SF9UVDljZ09vVDlJUlc1RjY4TFM5YTFtRTZMZkNUbHgxbURwR2ZRVW9fdjZxWFlUNGFKdw</guid></item><item><title>Brains Use Social Shortcuts to Master Complex Group Dynamics - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE55aWczcDF5Umx1dVFSU1N3OTdNVHFuYzFRZVR0ZVNGQXpYSU1hM05MM0pYQmRWRFcwUC1BNGpXU0lQYlM1MG1rVng0R0t3bnh6bU9VejlqN1oxdGFwaThkOF9xek8yakNBTFhBNktmMV9CZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that our brains simplify complex social interactions by using basic mental “building blocks” or shortcuts. Researchers scanned the brains of people playing a simple team game and observed how participants kept track of interactions with both teammates and opponents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than monitoring each individual separately, the brain creates simplified patterns that capture the essential dynamics of group behavior, particularly in the prefrontal cortex—an area important for decision-making and social skills. These findings help explain how we efficiently manage and interpret the constant flood of social information encountered daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Shortcuts:&lt;/strong&gt; Our brains use simplified mental patterns to manage complex social interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Tracking:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain simultaneously tracks both individual players and the sequence of their interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefrontal Cortex Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific brain activity in the prefrontal cortex encodes simplified social interaction patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brains use basic ‘building blocks’ of information to keep track of how people interact, enabling us to navigate complex social interactions, finds a new study led by University College London (UCL) researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers scanned the brains of participants who were playing a simple game involving a teammate and two opponents, to see how their brains were able to keep track of information about the group of players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108130"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and puzzle pieces." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/social-neuroscience-group-dynamics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers say these fundamental building blocks appear to represent patterns of interaction that are common to many different situations. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that rather than keeping track of the performance of each individual player, specific parts of the participants’ brains would react to specific patterns of interaction, or ‘building blocks’ of information that could be combined to understand what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Marco Wittmann (UCL Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences and Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research) said: “Humans are social creatures that are capable of keeping track of highly complex and fluid social dynamics, requiring a massive amount of brain power to remember not only individual people but also the various relationships between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to keep up with a group social interaction in real time, our brains must be using heuristics – mental shortcuts that help people make decisions quickly – to compress and simplify the wealth of information involved, with a system that minimises complexity while still allowing flexibility and detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this research, we found that our brains appear to use a set of basic ‘building blocks’ that represent fundamental aspects of social interactions, enabling us to quickly figure out new and complex social situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the team of scientists from UCL and the University of Oxford used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record the brain activity of 88 participants who were playing a simple game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in the scanner, the study participants were given a series of information about how they, a partner, and their opponents were faring in a game, and needed to keep track of the information in order to answer a question comparing performances of different players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wittmann explained: “We were interested to see whether our brains would use an ‘agent-centric’ frame of reference where specific parts of the brain keep track of each player’s performance, or a ‘sequential’ frame of reference tracking the information in the order it was received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that people actually do both, but our brains are able to simplify all of this information into bite-sized chunks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists were able to pinpoint specific patterns of activity in the brain that represented a few specific ‘building blocks’, each representing a pattern of interaction between the players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one building block kept information about how well a participant and their partner were doing relative to the other team. A bigger difference in performance between the two teams corresponded to an increase in brain activity related to this building block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These specific patterns of activity were found in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in decision-making and social behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say these fundamental building blocks appear to represent patterns of interaction that are common to many different situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Wittmann said: “As we develop social skills in life, our brains are likely learning specific interaction patterns that we come across again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patterns may become hard-wired into our brains as building blocks that get assembled and recombined to construct our understanding of any social setting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#27444f554e54094b4649426752444b09464409524c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chris Lane – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08705-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;” by Marco Wittmann et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating social environments is a fundamental challenge for the brain. It has been established that the brain solves this problem, in part, by representing social information in an agent-centric manner; knowledge about others’ abilities or attitudes is tagged to individuals such as ‘oneself’ or the ‘other’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intuitive approach has informed the understanding of key nodes in the social parts of the brain, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the patterns or combinations in which individuals might interact with one another is as important as the identities of the individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, in four studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, behavioural experiments and a social group decision-making task, we show that the dmPFC and ACC represent the combinatorial possibilities for social interaction afforded by a given situation, and that they do so in a compressed format resembling the basis functions used in spatial, visual and motor domains. The basis functions align with social interaction types, as opposed to individual identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results indicate that there are deep analogies between abstract neural coding schemes in the visual and motor domain and the construction of our sense of social identity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:10:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE55aWczcDF5Umx1dVFSU1N3OTdNVHFuYzFRZVR0ZVNGQXpYSU1hM05MM0pYQmRWRFcwUC1BNGpXU0lQYlM1MG1rVng0R0t3bnh6bU9VejlqN1oxdGFwaThkOF9xek8yakNBTFhBNktmMV9CZw</guid></item><item><title>CDC’s reported study on vaccines and autism could test RFK Jr.’s pledges to a key senator - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOdGZSREZBLUR1Z0NENTZobWQyQ1dVTHg5RWh0b01yTkd0bUFCUlZVU25XT0dDZzJTSkNLOHc4VlJGVXB4Umg0R0p5aS04dkpBNy1PbVp3d0dnVHM0YUhyRjMydUNpR1ZRNm1NN1JBSlRTUTVPa1UwRGlnaXZtZ2cwWFNzOVE4dlhLMnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports of a new federal plan to study whether there’s a link between vaccines and autism could serve as an early test of the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/04/rfk-jr-confirmation-vote-analysis-hard-line-on-vaccines-gop-senators-warn-trump-hhs-nominee/"&gt;commitments Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said he received&lt;/a&gt; from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in exchange for his support for RFK Jr.’s confirmation as Health and Human Services secretary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Friday, multiple news outlets reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was planning the study. Cassidy said last week that such a study would be a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/05/trump-nih-nominee-jay-bhattacharya-confirmation-research-on-vaccines-autism/"&gt;waste of time and money&lt;/a&gt;, because research has already shown there’s no link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When he backed Kennedy’s confirmation, one of the commitments Cassidy said he received was a pledge to keep communication lines wide open and to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/13/rfk-vote-hhs-secretary-how-kennedy-moved-from-fringe-to-center-of-power/"&gt;consult Cassidy on vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, when Cassidy was asked Tuesday for his reaction to the reports, he said he’s not even sure the agency truly intends to run such a study. &lt;/p&gt;

But some detractors attribute the clearing of skin simplyto an increase in water intake and overall hydration—something that also naturally aids with digestion, constipation, and energy. And though &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24930587/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2014 study&lt;/a&gt; on the clinical efficacy of chlorophyll used for acne treatment did find a reduction in acne and sebum levels, it was with the use of &lt;i class=" "&gt;topical &lt;/i&gt;chlorophyllin, not an oral supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Supplement makers claim that chlorophyll can do many things, but few of the claims are backed by scientific evidence,” says Surampudi. Research surrounding what chlorophyll actually does to the body is very limited, with many of the existing studies done on animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Can you have too much chlorophyll?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Naturally occurring chlorophyll from plants isn’t considered harmful to humans, even in large amounts. Experts generally recommend anywhere from 100 mg to 300 mg of liquid chlorophyllin per day for adults, but more studies are needed to determine if this is a truly effective dose in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Since the FDA does not regulate supplements, it is difficult to know upper limits,” says Surampudi.  “Chlorophyllin supplements can have side effects, including gastrointestinal issues, skin reactions, and allergic reactions.” While they are generally considered safe, she stresses that it’s important to consult with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements. Additionally, there has been no research on the safety of chlorophyllin on women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Going the natural route&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you’re still chlorophyll curious, you can get your intake by simply eating your greens. Foods high in chlorophyll include spinach, collard greens, mustard greens, alfalfa, parsley, green cabbage, asparagus, chlorella, and spirulina. In addition to these foods, it’s generally important to eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National Geographic</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 21:00:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQZVJRM2dicHJtMUxtMHRGM3ozZjZCZ09Gc2E0MzctVXIzcDczSUd4TTRXcklJakJDcHdwRzJEemcxZm45Y25raHVDSnJobVlsdlNrVnp5emRIMmJxZ09DU3l1cE9sU05KU2pWbExBUklCRDBfczMyUzNpUml0NVliTVhRX3U3eFZzcTg3ckdR</guid></item><item><title>Scientists find natural molecule that works like Ozempic - NewsNation Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1DUDhRbExzSGdxZTVobFgteG1USDF0VFZtOWtZVXJuc0lxQTdZRzQ0Yl9OMV9RUml0RlkyazkxME52RmdZV0ZsbWp2Rl9RSU03MGJfM2x1QWFVOUpBZTNtcjNscERMQlBnVzNnZEFsUdIBdEFVX3lxTE5ZNVRPTEpqZHZkQVVSS3dMSWcxeWRsZlJmMkROUEUxQjBYa055ZEdaTkttc1QtWG1Rd19LX3NtcU9qUUhUUzQ3V0Fjc3N5dVQwZ3c3MzBRRjIzQURUc1FXWDVzaHhjT2NTV3R0Nk92bmNWS0E1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

I’m a &lt;a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/transdisciplinary-areas-of-excellence/sustainable-communities/about/profile.html?id=lina"&gt;registered dietitian and nutritional neuroscientist&lt;/a&gt;. My research, along with the work of others in the field, shows that your diet and lifestyle choices may contribute to your struggles. These two factors are closely interconnected and could be the key to understanding what’s holding you back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, not getting enough of three essential nutrients – &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; – is linked to low energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 40% of adult Americans &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2010.12.001"&gt;are deficient in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;. Low levels are linked to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15050-vitamin-d-vitamin-d-deficiency"&gt;fatigue, bone pain, muscle weakness, mood disorders and cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/resources/2020-2025-dietary-guidelines-online-materials/food-sources-select-nutrients/food-sources-vitamin-d"&gt;Foods high in vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; include fatty fish like salmon, sardines, freshwater rainbow trout, fortified dairy products and egg yolks. Among the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13114144"&gt;sources for vegetarians and vegans&lt;/a&gt; are fortified plant-based milks and cereals and some kinds of mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government’s &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/pdf/factsheets/vitamind-consumer.pdf"&gt;recommended daily amount of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is 400 international units, or IU, for infants up to 12 months, 600 IU for people ages 1 to 70 and 800 IU for people over 70. Just over 5 ounces (150 grams) of sockeye salmon fillet has about 800 IU of vitamin D. If you are low in a vitamin, your doctor may prescribe you a higher dose than the recommended daily amount to elevate your blood levels to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20% of Americans have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.26947A"&gt;inadequate vitamin B12 levels&lt;/a&gt;, which can impair energy production and lead to anemia, resulting in fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low levels of B12 are notably higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jppr.1897"&gt;in older people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-03025-4"&gt;pregnant and lactating women&lt;/a&gt;, people with gastrointestinal disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.ibdrelief.com/learn/complications-of-ibd/vitamin-and-mineral-deficiencies-in-ibd/vitamin-b12-and-ibd#"&gt;inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;, those who &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-b12/art-20363663"&gt;take certain medications&lt;/a&gt; like proton-pump inhibitors, and people with &lt;a href="https://ranimd.com/articles/does-drinking-alcohol-affect-vitamin-b12-levels#"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because vitamin B12 is primarily found in meat, fish, dairy and eggs, vegetarians and vegans should consider taking a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00394-022-03025-4"&gt;vitamin B12 supplement&lt;/a&gt;. The recommended daily amount for anyone ages 4 and older is 2.4 micrograms, about what’s found in 3 ounces of tuna or Atlantic salmon. Pregnant and breastfeeding women &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/vitamin-b12-cobalamin"&gt;require slightly more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking B12 supplements can be as effective as getting the vitamin from food – and taking the supplement with food &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/are-you-getting-enough-b12#:%7E"&gt;may enhance its absorption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, here’s a note on supplements in general: While they can be beneficial, they shouldn’t replace whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are supplements &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/dietary-supplements"&gt;less strictly regulated by the Food and Drug Administration compared to prescription and over-the-counter drugs&lt;/a&gt;, making their potency uncertain, but real food also provides a complex array of nutrients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2023.1279925"&gt;that work in a synergistic way&lt;/a&gt;. Many supplements on the market boast multiple servings of vegetables, but nothing beats the actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 87% of adults ages 40 to 59, and about 80% of those 60 and older, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db399-H.pdf"&gt;don’t get enough omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; to meet dietary recommendations. Neither do &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/prenatal-supplements-largely-lack-the-recommended-amount-of-omega-3-fatty-acids-to-help-prevent-preterm-birth-new-research-244231"&gt;many pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are crucial for brain health, and a deficiency can lead to higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu10060663"&gt;anxiety and depression levels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MOL.0000000000000862"&gt;impaired cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. Taken together, these deficiencies can add to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best sources of omega-3 fatty acids &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/#"&gt;are fatty fish&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re strictly vegan, flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts can be great alternatives. However, it’s worth noting the omega-3s in fish are absorbed better in the body &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.596292"&gt;than plant sources&lt;/a&gt; – and that determines how efficiently the body can use the omega-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, whole flaxseed has a tough outer shell, which makes it more difficult to digest and absorb its nutrients. But ground flaxseed has been broken down, making the omega-3s and other nutrients &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/flaxseed/faq-20058354#"&gt;more available for absorption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although alcohol may provide a sense of relaxation in the moment, it actually &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/alcohol-and-fatigue"&gt;contributes to fatigue&lt;/a&gt; after the buzz wears off. Alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/what-does-drinking-alcohol-do-to-your-body.h00-159696756.html"&gt;is a toxin&lt;/a&gt;; it forces your body to prioritize its metabolism over that of nutrients, which means the body reduces the use of carbohydrates and fat for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602002"&gt;reduces the absorption of B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, which consequently affects energy production. The bottom line: If you drink alcohol, ultimately you will feel tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet isn’t everything. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.116-a160"&gt;Sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/light-exercise-can-yield-significant-cognitive-benefits-new-research-shows-243559"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-can-give-athletes-an-edge-over-competitors-but-few-recognize-how-fundamental-sleep-is-to-performance-221403"&gt;better sleep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-resilience-a-psychologist-explains-the-main-ingredients-that-help-people-manage-stress-218323"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; are all critical factors for reducing fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional/"&gt;can make vitamin D from sunlight&lt;/a&gt;, and you don’t need a lot. A few minutes up to a half hour of sun exposure can help most people get what they need. The amount of time can vary depending on where you live, how much clothing you wear and what time of year you get the exposure. You’ll reach your vitamin D daily quota much faster on a sunny day during the summer than a cloudy day in winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it may sound counterintuitive, but the more you exercise, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389"&gt;the more energy you will produce&lt;/a&gt;; working out doesn’t drain you. Instead, it boosts energy, along with mood, by improving blood flow and helping to release endorphins, which are hormones produced by the body to relieve pain or stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without exercise, the human body becomes less efficient at producing energy, which leads to lethargy. Coupled with erratic blood sugar levels – often caused by &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/worried-about-the-health-effects-of-the-sugar-in-your-breakfast-cereal-little-has-changed-since-the-days-of-unfrosted-the-pop-tarts-movie-233633"&gt;diets high in refined sugars&lt;/a&gt; and low in nutrients – these energy dips and spikes can leave you feeling irritable and drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim for at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html#:%7E"&gt;150 minutes of moderate exercise each week&lt;/a&gt; through activities like brisk walking, cycling, swimming and strength training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.slsci.2014.11.001"&gt;makes things even worse&lt;/a&gt;. Not getting enough rest &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-can-give-athletes-an-edge-over-competitors-but-few-recognize-how-fundamental-sleep-is-to-performance-221403"&gt;disrupts the body’s natural recovery processes&lt;/a&gt; and will leave you with diminished energy and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you should try to get &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2015.10.004"&gt;seven to nine hours of quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night. For some people &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/better-sleep-for-kids-starts-with-better-sleep-for-parents-especially-after-holiday-disruptions-to-routines-196110"&gt;this is not easy&lt;/a&gt;; creating a calming bedtime routine helps, and limiting screen time is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid phones, computers and other screens for at least 30 to 60 minutes before bed. The blue light emitted from screens can interfere with &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side"&gt;your body’s production of melatonin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. Conversely, activities like reading, meditation or gentle stretching help signal to your body that it’s time to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, there are things you can do about your fatigue. Smart choices help optimize mood, energy levels and overall health, and reduce the surges of sluggishness you feel throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: Your diet and lifestyle can make all the difference between being alert or wiped out.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/241745/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/241745/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

Exposed people should confirm vaccination against measles, authorities said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With measles outbreaks happening both in the United States and internationally, this recent case in our county highlights how important it is for anyone who has not been immunized to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine," said Muntu Davis, MD, MPH, Los Angeles County health officer, in the press release. "Measles spreads easily through the air and on surfaces, and a person infected with measles can pass it on to others before they feel sick or have symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, the last case of measles in a Los Angeles County resident was reported in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philly, NY cases not tied to other outbreaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Philadelphia, the measles patient is not connected to a case in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, or to outbreaks in west Texas, Oklahoma, or New Mexico. Instead, the patient was likely exposed during international travel.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe there is no threat to the general public associated with this case of measles." said Philadelphia Health Commissioner Palak Raval-Nelson, PhD, MPH.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;"As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. That's why it is critical for everyone who needs to be protected from measles to get vaccinated as soon as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As vaccination rates across the country continue to drop, there are more and more opportunities for people who cannot be vaccinated to be exposed to this deadly disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Suffolk County, New York, child, who authorities said was under the age of 5 years, represents the third measles case in New York this year. Authorities said there is no connection to ongoing outbreaks in the most recent case, and they urged New York residents to check their MMR immunization status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles can be very serious. It's much more than just a rash as complications can include pneumonia and inflammation of the brain, and often results in hospitalization. The most important thing people can do to protect themselves is to ensure they've been properly immunized against measles and immediately get a shot if they are not," State Health Commissioner James McDonald, MD, MPH, &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-03-11_measles.htm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said in a news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Late last week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues a Health Alert Network notice on US measles cases and warned travelers to be cautious during upcoming spring break travel.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rising cases in Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overseas, meanwhile, from February 2024 to January 2025, a total of 32,265 people were diagnosed as having measles in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), a sharp jump from the 2,361 cases reported in 2023.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most cases were reported by Romania (27,568), Italy (1,097), Germany (637), Belgium (551), and Austria (542), the ECDC said in a &lt;a href="https://measles-rubella-monthly.ecdc.europa.eu/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;monthly report &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on measles and rubella.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the period, Romania recorded 18 deaths attributed to measles and Ireland noted 1. Only Latvia and Liechtenstein reported zero cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although there is variation in the proportion of imported cases by country, the majority of cases in the EU/EEA acquired measles through local/community transmission within the reporting country," the report states.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 32,265 patients with known age, 14,556 (45.1%) were children under 5 years; 8,721 patients (27.0%) were aged 15 years or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 10,886 patients ages 1 to 4 years, 82.7% were unvaccinated, 1,082 (9.9%) were vaccinated with one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, 43 (0.4%) were vaccinated with two or more doses, and 757 (7%) were vaccinated with an unknown number of doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;A safe and effective vaccine has been used for decades to prevent measles," the ECDC said in a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076506"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;u&gt;news release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; yesterday. All EU/EEA countries recommend two MMR vaccine doses in their national immunization schedules.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;The surging measles outbreak, which has already sickened hundreds and hospitalized dozens in Texas and New Mexico, will get worse before it gets better. In a recent alert sent to health care providers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated that it expects the deadly virus to continue to spread rapidly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC’s warning was provided in a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; late last week. As of Tuesday, Texas health officials have &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; 223 measles cases in the state, with 29 hospitalized and one dead as a result. Measles has also been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in other states this year, including New Mexico, New York, Alaska, and Florida.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak has been ongoing since mid-January. It’s largely affected people living in Mennonite communities in rural western Texas, many of whom are unvaccinated. In late February, an unvaccinated “school-aged” child in Texas died from the preventable viral disease—the first such U.S. death &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-outbreak-in-texas-turns-deadly-as-parents-scramble-for-shots-2000568730"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in a decade. The outbreak has also spread to neighboring regions of New Mexico, with 33 reported cases so far. In early March, New Mexico health officials &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/u-s-measles-outbreak-tops-200-cases-as-second-death-investigated-2000573252"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a recently deceased resident tested positive for measles, though an investigation into this person’s official cause of death is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because measles is highly contagious, it can quickly spread through communities with relatively low vaccination rates. Roughly 94% of a population has to be vaccinated against measles to prevent widespread transmission, a concept known as herd immunity. Very early on into the outbreak, local health officials &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-is-rampaging-through-rural-texas-dozens-sick-hundreds-feared-infected-2000564981"&gt;expressed concerns&lt;/a&gt; that hundreds had already been infected, and that tally has likely gotten bigger since. Even a month ago, the outbreak was the largest seen in the state in nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles was locally eliminated in the U.S. 25 years ago, though outbreaks have occasionally appeared in pockets of the country where vaccination rates are low (these outbreaks will usually start when an infected person travels back from a region where the disease is endemic). While the risk for widespread measles in the United States remains low, thanks to high vaccination rates nationwide, the CDC does expect the immediate situation in Texas and New Mexico to worsen. In its advisory, the CDC says the outbreak is continuing “to expand rapidly.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This year, there have been measles cases reported in 13 states. On Tuesday, Oklahoma health officials &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; two cases in the state that appear to be connected to the Texas and New Mexico clusters. The cases seen elsewhere appear to be travel-related, though it is possible that further outbreaks could emerge from them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, 2025’s total reported tally is well on pace to overtake the 285 measles cases reported nationwide last year. It remains to be seen whether this year will be worse than 2019, which featured widespread and sustained outbreaks in parts of New York that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-u-s-is-officially-free-of-measles-for-now-1838776475"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to strip away the country’s official status of having eliminated measles on a local level.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These latest outbreaks have occurred under the watch of Robert F. Kennedy Jr, the new head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Though Kennedy has expressed some support for measles vaccination since taking over the HHS, he has a long track record of spreading misinformation about the safety of vaccines, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. He has also recently touted &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;scientifically unsupported treatments&lt;/a&gt; for measles, such as cod liver oil supplements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For its part, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html"&gt;clearly states&lt;/a&gt; that the MMR vaccine “remains the most important tool for preventing measles.”&lt;/p&gt;

At least 12 states have measles cases linked to international travel, per the CDC. People can be exposed to measles in countries where the virus is endemic and bring it home, where numbers spread due to lack of vaccination, per health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the Texas outbreak, though, it’s not known how many have not been vaccinated. And five of those who got measles said they’d had at least one dose of the two-dose measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those who were born before 1957 and likely had measles already, as well as those who have received both vaccine doses, are not believed to be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="About-measles" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;About measles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But measles is extremely contagious, so health experts estimate that 90% of those who did not get vaccinated or have natural immunity and are exposed will develop the fever, rash and other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles is also a disease that works directly on the immune system, creating what has been dubbed “immune amnesia.” As &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/07/measles-immune-amnesia-raise-risk-other-ills/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/07/measles-immune-amnesia-raise-risk-other-ills/"&gt;Deseret News&lt;/a&gt; earlier reported, measles infection can wipe the immune system’s memory that it has had other illnesses, making it susceptible to future infection with those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Highly contagious, people can pass the virus on before symptoms appear, so they don’t know they have it. And it’s spread through air when someone with measles coughs, sneezes or otherwise disperses virus into the air. To add to the risk, that air can stay contaminated for at least a couple of hours, exposing others who have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That was the story in the East, where health officials announced that anyone passing through parts of Terminal A at Dulles International Airport on March 5 might have been exposed to measles, as &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/10/measles-maryland-traveler-dulles-passengers-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/10/measles-maryland-traveler-dulles-passengers-exposed/"&gt;Deseret News reported&lt;/a&gt;. An international traveler ended up at the hospital two days later in the emergency department, where measles was diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And this week, Philadelphia officials are warning of potential exposures to measles at several health facilities last week. An individual was exposed to measles during international travel and visited the South Philadelphia Health and Literacy Center, which houses a children’s primary care unit and part of the health department, as well as the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia emergency room, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/measles-philadelphia-exposure-chop-health-department/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/measles-philadelphia-exposure-chop-health-department/"&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="8350" data-height="5567"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BHEGTFNLD5EPZOXMGIRG6Q3LFQ.jpg?auth=e901ff1a8732bb52048dde1fba932e8db56cf2ba014484b9f8f1284feaffdb27&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BHEGTFNLD5EPZOXMGIRG6Q3LFQ.jpg?auth=e901ff1a8732bb52048dde1fba932e8db56cf2ba014484b9f8f1284feaffdb27&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Fernando Tarin, left, of Seagraves, Texas, and his mother Josie Granado wear face masks after being tested for measles at a mobile testing site outside Seminole Hospital District Friday, Feb. 21, 2025, in Seminole, Texas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Julio Cortez, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Tips-to-avoid-measles" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Tips to avoid measles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The concern is nationwide. Health officials in the Utah Department of Health and Human Services issued a press release recently urging residents to check their immunization records or talk to their health care providers to see if they are adequately vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Utah, people can learn that status by visiting &lt;a href="https://utah.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed508d0fee9a2d592f5274e9c&amp;amp;id=5e61ac9f0d&amp;amp;e=76993c1c8c" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;https://immunize.utah.gov/usiis-parents-individuals/&lt;/a&gt;. They can also look at their immunization records in the &lt;a href="https://utah.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed508d0fee9a2d592f5274e9c&amp;amp;id=f37bf9614c&amp;amp;e=76993c1c8c" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Docket app or website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per that notice, “A person who has measles can spread the illness to others even before they have symptoms. Most people will have mild illnesses like fever, rash, diarrhea, or ear infection. Measles can also cause pneumonia, encephalitis (brain infection), seizures, and even death. Young children, pregnant women, and people who have weakened immune systems are especially at risk of severe complications from measles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dr. Asim Cheema, internal medicine and cardiology physician at &lt;a href="https://yourdoctors.online/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Your Doctors Online&lt;/a&gt;, provided advice for parents on how to keep their children and themselves safe:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know the symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce exposure, especially for those too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For those who are exposed, Cheema recommends monitoring symptoms for up to two weeks and isolating if needed. It’s also important to call ahead before visiting a doctor if measles is suspected to avoid exposing anyone else at the clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The virus doesn’t discriminate — it will find and infect susceptible individuals regardless of age or health status. The current measles resurgence represents a critical public health challenge,” Cheema said in a written statement, noting possible complications that include pneumonia, brain swelling and even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Others note that measles can cause vision and hearing damage and developmental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nicholas Rupp of the Salt Lake County Health Department told Deseret News that students who are under- or unvaccinated with confirmed exposure to measles can be excluded from school and told to quarantine for up to 21 days to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If they are confirmed exposed, yes, under- and unvaccinated students will need to quarantine at home for 21 days to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The only exception is if the exposed student receives post-exposure prophylaxis (which for measles is MMR vaccine) within three days of the exposure,” he said. “Given that people with measles are contagious up to four days before the telltale rash appears, the three-day window can be challenging to meet since the original patient may not know they have measles and not just a cold until after that window has passed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:14:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNam80V01kcVEyUHktbHVHU3V4OFNRN3VJN0dOMFJxRW1xc3VlTjJwb2doRDdreUVDdmZWdm9pRXFyYUJXVFhLUGVFbXpHa0pXRWRIUkFEUUMwdDJFTjZIZk5QRTZHUDJOVUlhQXlmYl9WNi1RN3FCNTBfQTI5b2x4TWJYYzBiM1lHQ0tteFNmQW4yN3VQNFpQSnZfUXlSakZ3TkJJMWhCaEZLZm5vdFFrODlkZw</guid></item><item><title>A premotor cortical network in the brain allows people to voluntarily stop speaking, study suggests - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxOQUJ5R3p0NWtjQk9NZFRkU1RpcExXMTgzMVVib1hiWjRiNlVrcGtYY1Q4RzNnQmk3Q1o2Wm0zU2doMnljaUhXTUVSUVYzYnYtaTAzNC1XdU9KZ0w1YVNKZ0NrWUpFcFJ6bE9MZVgyQjlNNUFzcmswU014LThmWThIeDdHSFJGTFF3dGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speech is a unique human ability that is known to be supported by various motor and cognitive processes. When humans start speaking, they can decide to cease at any point; for instance, if they are interrupted by something happening or by another person speaking to them.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The ability to voluntarily stop speaking plays a central role in social interactions, as it allows people to engage in conversations with others while adaptively responding to social cues, environmental stimuli or interruptions. While many past studies explored the neural and cognitive underpinnings of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/speech/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; itself, the brain processes associated with speech inhibition remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Francisco recently set out to better understand how the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+brain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt; controls the ceasing of speech using tools to record neurophysiological signals. Their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02118-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Human Behaviour&lt;/i&gt;, unveils a previously unknown premotor cortical network that could support voluntary speech inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The cognitive and neural mechanisms of speech inhibition are not well understood," wrote Lingyun Zhao, Alexander B. Silva and their colleagues in their paper. "We have recorded direct high-density cortical activity while participants engaged in continuous speech production and were visually cued to stop speaking."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the neural underpinnings of voluntary speech cessation, Zhao, Silva and their colleagues used a neurophysiological recording technique known as high-density electrocorticography (ECoG). This technique allows researchers to monitor the electrical activity originating from the surface of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;They recruited 13 patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant epilepsy who had electrodes implanted on their brains' surfaces to better understand the brain regions that contribute to their epileptic seizures. These patients were asked to complete a speech-stopping task, which asked them to follow instructions on when to start and stop speaking, while their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural activity&lt;/a&gt; was recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Neural recordings revealed distinct activity in the premotor frontal cortex correlated with stopping speech," wrote the researchers. "This activity was found in largely separate cortical sites from regions encoding vocal tract articulatory movements. Moreover, this activity primarily occurred with abrupt stopping in the middle of an utterance, rather than naturally completing a phrase."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings gathered by this team of researchers hint at the existence of a specialized brain mechanism that supports the voluntary control of speech. Zhao, Silva and their colleagues conducted further tests aimed at validating the existence of this mechanism by stimulating specific parts of the premotor frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Electrocortical stimulation at many premotor sites with inhibitory stop activity caused involuntary speech arrest, which contradicts previous clinical interpretations of this effect as evidence for critical centers of speech production," wrote the team. "Together, these results suggest a previously unknown premotor cortical network that supports the inhibitory control of speech, providing implications for understanding both natural and altered speech production."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results of this study suggest that the human ability to voluntarily stop speech is supported by a particular inhibitory control neural network that had not been uncovered before. Future studies could help to further elucidate the functions and contributions of the newly identified premotor cortical network, which could in turn help to better understand some disorders linked to an impaired ability to voluntarily control speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google searches for “does vitamin A help with measles” have &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;amp;geo=US&amp;amp;q=Vitamin%20A&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;skyrocketed by more than 5,000%&lt;/a&gt; over the past month as the highly contagious virus continues to spread across the country. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surge in online interest comes after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/06/health/rfk-jr-spotlights-vitamin-to-fight-measles-but-experts-say-not-so-fast/"&gt;touted vitamin A as a potential treatment&lt;/a&gt; for measles. At least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;245 US cases have been reported&lt;/a&gt; in the first three months of 2025, along with two deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While vitamin A plays a crucial role in overall health, experts are warning that taking too much can lead to serious health risks. Here’s what you need to know about what vitamin A can — and can’t — do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. highlighted vitamin A as a way to fight measles. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is vitamin A?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is a fat-soluble nutrient, meaning it dissolves in fat and is stored in your body’s tissues and liver.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It plays a key role in maintaining healthy eyes, skin, reproductive health and a strong immune system. It also acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect cells from damage caused by free radicals in the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since your body can’t produce vitamin A on its own, you have to get it from your diet. In the US, vitamin A deficiency is considered rare, typically affecting people with conditions that hinder the body’s ability to absorb nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of foods rich in vitamin A, including dark leafy greens, yellow and orange fruits, and vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes and cantaloupes, as well as animal products like liver, eggs and milk. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are the benefits of vitamin A? &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most well-known benefits of vitamin A is its vital role in supporting vision and eye health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It helps maintain eyesight, especially in low light,” &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/y-tony-yang"&gt;Tony Yang&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and the associate dean for health policy and population science at the George Washington University School of Nursing, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/what-cant-vitamin-a-do-experts-on-the-health-benefits-of-the-nutrient--and-if-you-need-to-take-a-supplement-232645422.html"&gt;told Yahoo Life&lt;/a&gt;. “A deficiency can cause night blindness and increase the risk of vision loss.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Most people get enough vitamin A from their diets, though supplements can help boost intake.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;New Africa – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research indicates that people who consume more vitamin A-rich foods are less likely to develop eye issues like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10650191/"&gt;cataracts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6523787/"&gt;age-related macular degeneration&lt;/a&gt;. It has also been shown to protect against eye infections and even aid in tear production.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A boosts your immune system by supporting the production and function of white blood cells, which help capture and clear harmful bacteria and other pathogens from your bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, vitamin A plays an essential role in maintaining a healthy reproductive system, impacting both male and female fertility as well as fetal development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For your skin, vitamin A can work wonders. Prescription creams and pills containing retinoids, a synthetic form of vitamin A, are often used to treat severe acne and psoriasis. Studies also suggest that topical forms of vitamin A can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17515510/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some studies even point to a potential link between a higher intake of vitamin A-rich foods and a lower risk of certain cancers, including those affecting the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8465379/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;breast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4889797/#:~:text=Conclusion,colonic%20inflammation%20and%20cancer%20development." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3615216/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;esophagus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Unvaccinated children are particularly susceptible to measles. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;weerapat1003 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What vitamin A can’t do&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that vitamin A supplements are likely ineffective in preventing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3376697/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;head and neck cancer&lt;/a&gt;, reducing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/tools/elena/review-summaries/vitamina-hiv-pregnancy--vitamin-a-supplementation-for-reducing-the-risk-of-mother-to-child-transmission-of-hiv-infection" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;HIV transmission&lt;/a&gt; or alleviating symptoms of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9811920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lower airway infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same probably goes for measles. Famous for the signature red rash it causes, the highly contagious virus can also manifest as a cough, congestion, watery eyes, a sore throat and a high fever.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While most people with measles recover, severe complications can occur, and measles causes more than 100,000 deaths worldwide annually — mostly in unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;highlighted updated guidance&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommends taking vitamin A “under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate, and severe infection.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kennedy Jr. touted vitamin A as a potential treatment for measles. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Writing in a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Fox News op-ed&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy Jr. claimed that “studies have &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/suppl_1/i48/699532?login=false"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality.” However, doctors have warned that this guidance should not be misinterpreted as a substitute for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin A cannot replace vaccination,” &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/rmgulick" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Roy Gulick&lt;/a&gt;, chief of infectious disease at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/10/health/doc-warns-against-70s-trend-making-a-comeback-amid-measles-outbreaks/"&gt;said at a media briefing last week&lt;/a&gt;. “Vitamin A neither treats measles nor prevents measles.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added: “Why people are talking about vitamin A is that studies in developing countries showed that kids — predominantly with malnutrition — some had vitamin A deficiency. And so it was seen that if you gave vitamin A at the same time that you vaccinate people, they had better immune responses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A deficiency can cause more severe measles infections. In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2005 study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that giving these vitamin A-deficient kids under the age of 2 a double megadose of the nutrient (200,000 IUs twice over two days) after they’d been diagnosed with measles lowered their mortality rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are there risks associated with vitamin A? &lt;/h2&gt;




&lt;p&gt;While vitamin A offers many benefits, too much can be dangerous. Unlike water-soluble vitamins, excess vitamin A gets stored in the body and, over time, that buildup can become toxic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the short term, taking a single large dose — over 200,000 micrograms — can cause nausea, vomiting, vertigo and blurry vision, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-a/art-20365945" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Long-term use of more than 3,000 mcg a day can lead to serious side effects like bone thinning, liver damage, headaches, gastrointestinal issues, skin irritation and joint pain. Excessive vitamin A during pregnancy has also been linked to birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A can also interfere with other medications, including reducing their effectiveness. &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/drug-interactions/vitamin-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;At least 23 drugs&lt;/a&gt; are known to interact with vitamin A, so if you’re on any of them, it’s a good idea to consult with your doctor before taking supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been a great deal of research into Helmholtz resonance in general, but according to Yicong Fu of Cornell University and co-authors, there has not been any significant attempt to cross-confirm that human hand claps serve as Helmholtz resonators. So they recruited 10 participants to clap into a microphone 20–30 times each for three different hand configurations: cupped, palm to palm, and palm to finger. They used baby powder to map the air flow produced by the clapping, along with measuring pressure and capturing the action on high-speed video. They also made soft polymer hand replicas designed to mimic the elasticity of human skin and used them to generate clapping sounds for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The recorded frequencies matched the predictions of the Helmholtz resonator model, confirming that hand claps function like a resonator, rather than being a solid collision sound. Frequency depended upon hand configuration: clapping with cupped hands, for instance, produced lower frequencies than clapping with palm to finger because the cupped configuration created a larger resonant cavity. Clapping faster produces a louder initial sound, while lower skin elasticity produces a longer-lasting sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, "Our work provided the first experimental support for the theoretical framework and improved the fundamental understanding of hand claps for broader application potentials," the authors concluded. Specifically, "These findings may facilitate low-cost acoustical diagnostics in architecture and enhance rhythmic sound patterns in music and language education." It might even be possible one day to identify someone based on their distinctive claps and use it as a kind of acoustic login for electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dozens of the chicks – which spend 90 days in burrows before making their first journey – were examined by researchers from the University of Tasmania. Many had mistakenly been fed plastic waste by their parents and built up high levels of plastic in their stomachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Blood tests indicated that the plastic pollution had left the chicks with severe health issues, disrupting the stomach, liver, kidneys and brain, according to &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads0834?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D20597589108928405310818161390203415780%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1741698511" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Plastic ingestion in seabirds is nothing new.

But knowing the condition which their body is in before they’re starting their migration, it’s quite challenging to imagine that they would make it to the other end,” said de Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Previous research has found that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/24/survey-finds-that-60-firms-are-responsible-for-half-of-worlds-plastic-pollution" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fewer than 60 multinationals are &lt;/a&gt;responsible for more than half of the world’s plastic pollution, with six responsible for a quarter of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find more &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;age of extinction coverage here&lt;/a&gt;, and follow the biodiversity reporters &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/phoebe-weston" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Phoebe Weston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrick-greenfield" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Patrick Greenfield&lt;/a&gt; in the Guardian app for more nature coverage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 18:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQZWtUQjdkZXJBUnVuT2FSSVpHSm9lc0N1NmNtTC04MlFUel9fQ0ZhaUI2V2ZEbzFvdmtKTTJGZGp6ZHNLZHV3N0U5Z0ZOcFkwcC0ydDlJVmJtdldHX2plb1lzSDFYWGpLRHlxOFM0VEdMQ1RjUEJocmstdGlHY18ydUFZbUlZN3UzYllGMjNKb0VQRTQ1UFRzenZZM2hBZ0VhdTdPRzJ5Q3VhaWxVclY4ZU8zTXlha2NQT3ZnY0hfUEpKa05pckFtQkdxcHFkblNzTlZlYVU2V0VsUQ</guid></item><item><title>The Best Time To Eat Breakfast, Per A Registered Dietitian - TODAY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNT3FhY2JtR050QTdXWW1NeG9ybGUzWE1ua2RzQXpIclp0Sm1lRlNtQ0lnUWxlVlB6bXpIQkt4Q0NqUkRGcFNKS0R6a19HS1duT3A5cFotYzBxNnNpRnozYk5qNHNNUXRqUXhQbTNSR0FrcmNkOURnbTNYMmFMS01FdW02OEhsd9IBVEFVX3lxTE1WSkJqN2JGM3ZwR3JfNWp0aXJPb1VLT2hpM0FsMzJaLUNXUEUtR3JCY2Y2UGl1UXM2S2hBRVdmMEJfUF8wc2hGQVNFYk1JYmJBcGtqaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Breakfast has long been called the most important meal of the day. While I believe all meals are important, breakfast plays a unique role because your body is naturally primed to eat and metabolize food in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That’s because your body operates on an internal clock, known as your circadian rhythm, which influences everything from digestion to energy levels. Your circadian rhythm is like the conductor of an orchestra—each instrument (your digestion, metabolism, hormones and energy production) plays its part, but if the conductor is out of sync, the whole performance feels off. Eating in line with your body’s natural rhythm helps keep everything in harmony, which means having breakfast earlier rather than delaying your first meal for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Research suggests that eating earlier in the day may lead to better blood sugar control, improved weight management and even benefits for heart health. In fact, studies show that people who eat the bulk of their calories earlier tend to have an easier time maintaining a healthy weight compared to those who eat most of their calories later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Below, I’ll break down the science behind the best time to eat breakfast. And since research doesn’t always align perfectly with real life, you'll find tips when your breakfast time depends on your schedule, hunger cues and health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What is the best time to eat breakfast?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;From a metabolic standpoint, eating breakfast before &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/featured-science-from-endo-2021/eating-before-830-am-could-reduce-risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes" target="_blank"&gt;8:30 &lt;/a&gt;a.m. may be ideal. Your body is most insulin-sensitive in the morning, meaning it can process carbohydrates more efficiently, which may help stabilize blood sugar and energy levels throughout the day. This is in line with another published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43444-3" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which found that eating breakfast after 9:00 a.m. was associated with a higher risk of heart disease, suggesting that an earlier breakfast time may be good for your heart, too.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Additionally, research suggests eating earlier in the day may help regulate appetite and reduce overall calorie intake. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5969247/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that front-loading your calories results in greater weight loss and improvements in triglyceride levels and glucose regulation, as well as lower hunger levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Should I eat breakfast at the same time each day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To the degree possible, this is a good idea. Your body thrives on routine, and your hunger hormones follow a rhythm based on when you typically eat. Furthermore, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0531556522001450?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that people who had fewer variations in their a.m. eating routine were more likely to achieve better calorie reductions and lose more weight compared to people who were less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Granted, life doesn’t always allow for perfect consistency. If your schedule fluctuates — say, an early meeting or doctor's appointment— aim for a general window rather than stressing over an exact time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Does the timing of breakfast influence weight management?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Yes. Emerging research suggests that people who eat earlier in the day tend to have an easier time managing their weight. Why? Your metabolism isn’t the same throughout the day. As the day progresses, your body becomes less effective at processing food, and late-night eating may increase fat storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That said, meal timing is only one piece of the puzzle. The quality of your meals and overall calorie intake matter just as much — if not more — than when you eat. There are plenty of other factors involved in weight management, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What if I’m not hungry for breakfast?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This can happen, but I’d suggest determining why you &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/health/waking-up-hungry-rcna192814" target="_blank"&gt;aren’t hungry within a couple of hours of waking up&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, if you’re skipping breakfast because you’re overly full from late-night eating, this could be a sign that your meal timing needs an adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re not hungry but want to establish a healthy breakfast habit, start small by adjusting the timing of dinner, and wrapping up at least two hours before bedtime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Then, have something to eat within a couple of hours of waking up, starting with something small, such as a container of unsweetened or low-sugar Greek yogurt. Breakfast doesn’t have to be a huge production, but most of the evidence supports a morning meal for better metabolic health and weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Is it ever ok to skip breakfast?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Yes, because nothing is black and white, and each person has unique needs and goals. Some people genuinely feel better when they don’t eat in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;However, skipping breakfast may backfire if:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;You find yourself overeating later in the day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You lack energy and focus in the morning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You struggle with blood sugar regulation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If skipping breakfast leaves you ravenous by lunch and leads to unhealthy food choices, a balanced morning meal may help you feel more in control throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What if I’m participating in intermittent fasting?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/how-lose-weight-intermittent-fasting-16-8-diet-t132608" target="_blank"&gt;Intermittent fasting &lt;/a&gt;(IF) involves eating within a specific window — often 8 hours — and fasting for the remaining hours. Many people extend their overnight fast and skip breakfast, allowing them to eat a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/best-time-to-eat-dinner-rcna193463" target="_blank"&gt;later dinner&lt;/a&gt;. This pattern of eating aligns with many people’s social schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, I’d suggest considering shifting your eating window earlier rather than later. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36702768/#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20early%20TRE%20rather,blood%20pressure%2C%20and%20lipid%20profiles." target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that an early time-restricted feeding schedule (eating between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., for example) may offer more metabolic benefits than eating later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That said, this may not be practical, so if you’re practicing IF, your best fasting window depends partially on your lifestyle. If skipping breakfast works for you, there’s no need to force it. But if you feel sluggish or struggle with intense hunger later in the day, an earlier eating window might be a better fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What are the best foods to eat for breakfast?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Regardless of when you eat, what you eat matters. A balanced breakfast should include protein, fiber, and healthy fats to keep you full and energized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In fact, protein is especially important at breakfast since your body is hard at work repairing and rebuilding while you sleep. Part of that process involves breaking down protein stores for essential functions. By morning, the supply needs to be replenished to keep the work going. Eating &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/high-protein-breakfast-ideas-rcna121190" target="_blank"&gt;protein at breakfast&lt;/a&gt; helps restock those building blocks, supporting muscle repair and maintenance while also providing fuel to start the day off on the right foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="body-heading"&gt;Some top choices include:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eggs and cottage cheese with whole-grain toast and avocado&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greek yogurt with nuts and berries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A smoothie with protein powder, fruit and flaxseeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A tofu scramble with mushrooms and baked sweet potato fries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;I’d also suggest being mindful of highly refined carbs (like pastries, sugary cereals and white bread) since these are some of the heavily processed foods we ought to be limiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Eating breakfast in sync with your body’s natural rhythm can support metabolism, weight management, blood sugar control and overall health. While research suggests an earlier breakfast may be beneficial, that may not be practical for everyone. Whether you eat right away or a bit later, choosing a balanced meal with protein and fiber can help fill you up, promote muscle growth and repair, and potentially reduce cravings and overeating later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNT3FhY2JtR050QTdXWW1NeG9ybGUzWE1ua2RzQXpIclp0Sm1lRlNtQ0lnUWxlVlB6bXpIQkt4Q0NqUkRGcFNKS0R6a19HS1duT3A5cFotYzBxNnNpRnozYk5qNHNNUXRqUXhQbTNSR0FrcmNkOURnbTNYMmFMS01FdW02OEhsd9IBVEFVX3lxTE1WSkJqN2JGM3ZwR3JfNWp0aXJPb1VLT2hpM0FsMzJaLUNXUEUtR3JCY2Y2UGl1UXM2S2hBRVdmMEJfUF8wc2hGQVNFYk1JYmJBcGtqaw</guid></item><item><title>Study shows widespread bird flu infection in cattle - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxOYk1WMUhTS3E1cVhuZkZDYjlmR1hBOTRTc3hsOXp5cjg4cHlRRjY4MThIVUJVbXk3Q3BQekRrSTJQUkJHamtVbTZqaG5zUXdISnNuRVRTTWQtcEFLbEotWDJtakNjY29QeW1XQ2RHZDFiSkg4cVVoUk0xbzB2NXpPekxxNVBLQmdNZWhTNGRDRkhqSDhudDVzZzZUZU55WkduV3NyZXZYVGdaMkl6SUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-body font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 text-primary-text-color clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists are sounding alarms about a genetic mutation that was recently identified in four dairy cow herds, nearly &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-04-14/nobody-saw-this-coming-california-dairies-scramble-to-guard-herds-against-bird-flu"&gt;one year after H5N1 bird flu was first reported in Texas dairy cattle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change is one that researchers have dreaded finding because it is associated with increased mammal-to-mammal transmission and disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is the mutation &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2405371" target="_blank"&gt;found in the first human case&lt;/a&gt;, which was extremely pathogenic in ferrets,” said Yoshihiro Kawaoka, an infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and the University of Tokyo. “Finding the same mutation in cows is significant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation is called PB2 E627K, and it was seen in a Texas dairy worker last March. It was not seen again until these sequences were uploaded late Tuesday. The data was uploaded by the USDA’s National Veterinary Laboratory Services to a public access genetic repository known as &lt;a class="link" href="https://gisaid.org/" target="_blank"&gt;GISAID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Niman, an evolutionary molecular biologist with Recombinomics Inc., a virus and vaccine research company in Pittsburgh, reviewed the sequence data and reported the results to The Times and on social media Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last summer, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08254-7" target="_blank"&gt;Kawaoka exposed ferrets&lt;/a&gt; in his laboratory to that viral strain. He found the ferrets were able to transmit the virus to one another via respiratory droplets, and it killed 100% of the infected animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas dairy worker complained only of conjunctivitis; he didn’t have a fever or show signs of respiratory dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data provided to GISAID don’t include location data, so scientists often use other information to identify the herds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, because the sequence data was added Tuesday, it is likely from herds that were only recently reported by the USDA. In the last week, herds from Idaho and California have been added to the USDA’s tally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The herds in California have the more common B3.13 strain, which has been associated with dairy cows since last year. The strain circulating in Idaho is D1.1, which spilled over from wild birds earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the new sequence data added on Tuesday — which were of the B3.13 variety — are likely from infected California herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the outbreak was first reported in dairy cows last March, 70 people have been infected and one person has died. According to the USDA, 985 dairy herds have been infected, with 754 of those located in California. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:42:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOYk1WMUhTS3E1cVhuZkZDYjlmR1hBOTRTc3hsOXp5cjg4cHlRRjY4MThIVUJVbXk3Q3BQekRrSTJQUkJHamtVbTZqaG5zUXdISnNuRVRTTWQtcEFLbEotWDJtakNjY29QeW1XQ2RHZDFiSkg4cVVoUk0xbzB2NXpPekxxNVBLQmdNZWhTNGRDRkhqSDhudDVzZzZUZU55WkduV3NyZXZYVGdaMkl6SUE</guid></item><item><title>Uh … Am I Protected Against Measles?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm862la1o0068ejm4fowfjovz@published"&gt;If you’ve been carefully tracking the measles outbreak in the Southwest, you know that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nzyjgrwxo"&gt;two people with the illness have died&lt;/a&gt;. Both were unvaccinated, and one was an otherwise healthy 6-year-old. You know that the child’s Mennonite community in West Texas continues to get hit hard, with &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;223 cases as of Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. And you know that there’s another cluster of cases in New Mexico—where the second death occurred—&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/measles-outbreak-grows-hantavirus"&gt;that’s genetically linked&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001v3b725zue3u84@published"&gt;Given all that, you might also be wondering if you need to do anything to protect yourself and your loved ones: Am I vaccinated &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt;? Do I need a measles booster? Should I confirm that I’m immune by taking something called a &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/antibody-titer"&gt;titer test&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001w3b725nnsbnd0@published"&gt;“It’s the question du jour,” says William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001x3b72d667lnez@published"&gt;It makes sense to worry: “Measles is not a trivial disease,” Schaffner reminds me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2015/01/measles-outbreak-at-disney-anti-mmr-vaccine-activists-claim-disease-isnt-dangerous.html"&gt;Quite the opposite&lt;/a&gt;: Although measles, the most contagious virus on record, doesn’t have a &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; high mortality rate (1 to 3 in every 1,000 infected people will die), it sends &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/infectious-disease/measles/"&gt;20 percent of unvaccinated people to the hospital&lt;/a&gt;—and that number is higher for children under 5—with serious complications ranging from pneumonia to brain swelling. Basically, you are right to not be reassured by that mortality rate. “We shouldn’t only be talking about death,” says &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/about-us"&gt;Jess Steier&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the public health data science consulting firm (and &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/podcast"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Unbiased Science&lt;/em&gt;. “We want to avoid infection at all costs.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjc001y3b723xayt500@published"&gt;The good news is that we have an effective and safe vaccine that does exactly that: For most people, it &lt;em&gt;completely prevents&lt;/em&gt; infection (unlike, say, the flu vaccine, which may solely &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/19/nx-s1-5302906/cdc-flu-vaccine-campaign-terminated"&gt;ease symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, not prevent you from getting the flu entirely). Thanks to the measles vaccine, usually called the MMR vaccine, in combination with mumps and rubella, the U.S. declared measles to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;be effectively eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. The reason it’s coming back is that people are unvaccinated. To reach herd immunity—enough of a population being immune that measles can no longer spread—about 95 percent of people need to be vaccinated. In the Texas community where the child died during the outbreak, the measles vaccination rate among kindergartners is 82 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd001z3b72hx360qro@published"&gt;If you are healthy, got two doses of MMR, and were born after 1989: you’re good. “The recommendation is, sit pretty,” says Steier. Two doses of MMR &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/should-you-get-a-measles-vaccine-booster#:~:text=No%20vaccine%20is%20100%25%20effective,97%25%20effective%20against%20rubella.)"&gt;provides lifetime protection&lt;/a&gt; for about 97 percent of people. (The other 3 percent may still get measles but will likely have milder symptoms and be less able to spread the virus than they would otherwise.) So if you were vaccinated after 1989, there’s absolutely no need to get a booster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00203b728nno2vvh@published"&gt;If you were born before 1957, you also don’t need to worry about vaccination. You were born at a time when measles still ran rampant, so you almost certainly had the virus as a kid and are now immune. It’s not the ideal way to get immunity, but congratulations! You have it.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00213b722j0nav6h@published"&gt;If you were born between 1957 and 1989, you should pull out your vaccination records to review your history, says Schaffner. People born between 1957 and 1967 were getting vaccinated, but some received a version of the vaccine that was less effective than the one we use today. And many born between 1967 and 1989 got only one dose of MMR, which was the recommendation at the time but means they’re less likely to be &lt;em&gt;fully&lt;/em&gt; protected. If you received the less effective vaccine or got just one shot, it’s a good idea to get a booster vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00223b72zmq5w2n3@published"&gt;Then there’s the other category: people who aren’t sure. Perhaps you can’t find your vaccination records, you were born &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; 1989, or you have no idea which version of the vaccine you got. If you really don’t know, the answer is simple. “Go into your health care provider, roll up your sleeve, and ask for a dose of MMR,” says Schaffner. (An exception is if you’re pregnant, in which case it’s recommended that you &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/02/28/can-you-get-the-measles-vaccine-while-pregnant/"&gt;wait to vaccinate&lt;/a&gt;.) Even if you don’t need another MMR dose, it won’t hurt to get the extra one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srjd00233b72ftc7l9yo@published"&gt;Another key exception here is for people who &lt;a href="https://time.com/7266454/measles-outbreak-essay-ashish-jha/"&gt;are severely immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, such as cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. MMR is a live vaccine, and the worry is that it could replicate and cause illness if a recipient’s immune system is too weak. It’s also worth noting that people who were vaccinated before becoming immunocompromised may face reduced immunity. This population relies on herd immunity to stay safe from measles. That is why getting vaccinated is more than a &lt;a href="https://www.texaschildrens.org/content/wellness/vaccines-personal-choice-or-moral-responsibility"&gt;personal decision&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, worrying about our own personal health is one of the limited things we can do right now when it comes to the scary spread of measles: “While we can’t fully control our environment, we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; control our own immunization status,” writes infectious disease epidemiologist Nina Masters in her newsletter &lt;a href="https://knowyourvax.com/2025/02/21/measles-coming-to-a-city-near-you/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;Know Your Vax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srje00243b72n6q3buvf@published"&gt;You might have heard about a titer test, which looks at the amount of antibodies in a person’s blood in order to confirm that they are immune. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/services/titers-and-immunity-testing"&gt;a common service&lt;/a&gt;, but in most cases, &lt;a href="https://www.southshorehealth.org/wellness/blog/do-adults-need-measles-titer-check"&gt;some experts argue&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re that unsure of your status for measles, you should just get a booster. Checking titers requires an extra doctor’s visit and extra expense, so it’s a hassle. Plus, titers don’t provide a complete picture of your immunity, says Steier. Even if your antibody levels come back low, you have what are called memory B cells, which could be helping to protect you—and because they don’t make much antibody, they won’t really show up on that test. If you feel as if you have to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;, skip the titers and get the booster.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm865srje00253b72h87mp80y@published"&gt;But unless you’re in the heart of an outbreak, don’t worry too much. “You don’t need to run to your practitioner,” says Schaffner. The next time you’re at the doctor, though, ask them to review your vaccination history. It’s always a good idea to make sure you’re fully &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;protected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Instead, it slowly breaks down into ever-smaller pieces. Microplastics, as the name suggests, are the microscopic debris that packaging will eventually become. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the way in which plastic gradually breaks down, microplastics come in a wide range of sizes. This means that they are the right size for every animal on Earth to swallow or breathe in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this variety in size and their sheer ubiquity, they are present in every food chain and on every dinner plate in the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adl2746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; on the topic: “Emissions of microplastics to the environment are estimated to be between 10 and 40 million tonnes per year, and under business-as-usual scenarios, this amount could double by 2040.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research into microplastics is still in its infancy, but already, scientists are unearthing worrying links. For instance, there is some evidence that microplastics in blood might &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/tiny-plastic-particles-in-human-blood-could-pose-risk-to-heart-health" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;negatively impact heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarly, a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dementia-are-microplastics-accumulating-in-our-brains-a-risk-factor" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this year found more microplastics in human brains than in any other organ.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also showed that people who died in 2024 had, on average, 50% more microplastics in their brains than people who died just 8 years earlier. Clearly, this is a growing issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “microplastics” first appeared in a scientific paper just over &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adl2746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;20 years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, interest has grown exponentially, but scientists are still trying to understand what factors influence an individual’s exposure and how to minimize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although avoiding them entirely is impossible, the authors of the recent commentary include some science-backed ways to reduce exposure. Below, we outline their advice, including input from other experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Water: Bottled, tap, and boiled&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; concludes that switching from bottled water to tap water could reduce intake of microplastics from 90,000 each year to 4,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that is a sizable reduction, it is worth bearing in mind that these calculations compare someone who only drinks bottled water with someone who only drinks tap water. Most people are likely to be somewhere in between these two scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the same study, bottled water was the second greatest source of microplastics. In first place, was the air that we breathe — not something we can easily avoid — and seafood was in third position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, these three “accounted for the large majority of microplastic intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another study, scientists identified a relatively simple, although time-consuming method of reducing microplastics in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Are teabags safe?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, teabags were made of paper. Today, as with so much else, they contain plastics. A 2019 study, also in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552738/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Science and Technology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, investigated whether teabags would shed plastic into the final beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they steeped a single teabag in 95 °C water, it released well over 14 billion microplastics into the final drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who enjoy tea, it might be worth searching for manufacturers who produce teabags without plastic or switching to loose-leaf teas and a good old-fashioned tea strainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. How to reduce exposure around the home&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is inside our homes that we are the most exposed,” he explained. “Anything made of nylon or polyester — clothes, furniture, curtains, carpets, cushions, toys, pet toys, you name it — are shedding microplastic fibers all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He recommended sweeping or vacuuming as much as possible and, “if you can, do not buy polyester or nylon covered bedding, towels, underwear, furniture, rugs, or carpets,” which all shed microplastics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.5gyres.org/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Lisa Erdle, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, director of science and innovation at the 5 Gyres Institute, a research-based non-governmental organization with 15 years of expertise studying microplastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggested “installing a microfiber-catching filter to laundry machines and dryers, opting for home textiles (curtains, couches, rugs) made from natural fibers instead of synthetic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Avoid plastic utensils in the kitchen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we heat up food in microwavable plastics, microplastics leach directly into our food,” Charron explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. He recommended not heating food in plastic containers or on plastic plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“It’s the same when we use plastics utensils, straws, chopping boards, pans, plates, anything,” he continued. Instead, he suggested opting for natural materials, like glass, wood, bamboo, and cotton where possible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along similar lines, Erdle recommended “avoiding plastic packaging — especially when microwaving, and using metal or glass for cooking and storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also suggested avoiding ultra-processed foods, which are often sold in plastic containers and have many opportunities to pick up plastic contamination during manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Reduce use of beauty products&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Use as few toiletries as possible because they often contain plastic chemicals like &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/phthalates-may-increase-diabetes-risk-in-women-but-which-women-and-why" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt;,” Charron also advised. “Plus, the plastic packaging used in the beauty and personal-care market creates vast amounts of plastic pollution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to him, in the United States in 2018 alone, the beauty industry alone produced &lt;a href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/blog/2022/1/25/the-ugly-side-of-beauty-the-cosmetics-industrys-plastic-packaging-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;7.9 billion units&lt;/a&gt; of rigid plastic packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Erdle suggested “choosing personal care and cleaning products without plastic microbeads.” Microbeads are tiny plastic spheres found in a wide range of cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Food and Drug Administration (FDA)" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-laws-regulations/microbead-free-waters-act-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;U.S. has banned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; the use of microbeads in “rinse-off” products, they are still allowed in many cosmetics that are not rinsed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Erdle about the future of packaging and whether there any hopeful innovations on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explained that certain biomaterials may eventually help wean society off plastic. However, there are many challenges. Plastic is popular for a reason: It is incredibly cheap to produce, easy to mould and shape, and, unfortunately, lasts for a very long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Erdle has hope. “While biomaterials are not functional replacements for all plastic products, we’ve seen a lot of potential in using biomaterials to replace thin film,” she told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, because consumers are now looking for more eco-friendly products, some manufacturers are using eco-friendly claims to make their products more appealing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, packaging labeled “biodegradable,” does not specify under which conditions it will degrade. &lt;a href="https://www.5gyres.org/betteralternatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; by 5 Gyres Institute shows that the thickness of the material and the environment it is placed in make a sizable difference to whether something truly biodegrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics and their role in health is a rapidly developing and concerning field of research. For now, following the above recommendations may limit an individuals exposure, but we need much more research to understand how microplastics influence health and to develop new materials that can finally kick plastics out of our homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOTURkWkpYQ3ZWNzg3TE03NDAyY2RJZEIzOVl0SWkxXzh2M0NnMUFhdkdSR3VuSmNPYUhhSUwyWEt3Sm1GSDFCQmZ4RklqSWJYRUNaem5qalFYXzlLU1ktYS1TV0U5QXhLekpoamFtNFhrMjJsYzVCMWJqMWp1WGd3bHZObTRQbVZiNDdwalphQW1CR0tObXBObUxB</guid></item><item><title>Epstein-Barr virus may drive MS by dysregulating certain immune cells - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNMUJjZkUzeHdwUzI0cmU1RDg1UnV5TjE1UHhFalU4cG1Bc0dUb2hUX3hkVU44cm10Z0dRYmJodEtNRmxfV3FwZVh3UW5PTnVVM1EzcFJsN1ZsclNXdVFOWFRzLXVVdkZUeFJueEpLNHNGTmZLWmdmYVh1YkhQdzVEdzNlazBHcHN6NGc0bjFwbXdsQ0hGcEhuZkNyUG9GUzBoRWtKWkZVMVdDaUpneUQ1LWNwQ0pPVkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lymph nodes of the neck of people with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), certain immune cells show abnormalities in activity and signs of reactions against the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a new study reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings may help to explain the connection between MS and EBV, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adl3604"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Altered immune landscape of cervical lymph nodes reveals Epstein-Barr virus signature in multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/epstein-barr-virus-and-ms/"&gt;Epstein-Barr virus&lt;/a&gt; is well-known for causing infectious mononucleosis, colloquially known as mono. EBV can also infect people and cause nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms at all, so while most adults have been infected with the virus, the majority does not know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;EBV infection key risk factor for MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A building body of evidence has suggested EBV infection is a key &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;risk factor for MS&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, some data suggest MS can only develop in people who have a history of EBV infection. However, it remains unclear exactly how EBV may set the stage for MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To better understand the interaction between EBV and MS, researchers conducted detailed analyses of immune cells extracted from lymph notes in the neck. The analysis included lymph nodes from seven people with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/newly-diagnosed-guide-for-ms/"&gt;newly diagnosed MS&lt;/a&gt; and six people who did not have MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lymph nodes are immune organs — if immune cells are the body’s soldiers, the lymph nodes are like barracks where immune cells live and train to do battle. The researchers specifically focused on lymph nodes of the neck because part of the immune response against EBV seems to occur in that location, so they’re most likely to play roles in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found MS patients showed marked abnormalities in their B-cells, the immune cells that make antibodies, which have been heavily implicated in the development of MS. Specifically, MS patients had more memory B-cells, which are B-cells that are produced after infection to help the body fight off the same infection if it occurs again. At the same time, patients had fewer germinal center B-cells, which are basically B-cells that are actively involved in fighting infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate a significant disturbance in B cell maturation in [neck lymph nodes] of [people with] MS compared with those of healthy controls,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, EBV is able to infect B-cells and alter their activity. This has been hypothesized to be one of the main mechanisms that might link EBV and MS. Supporting that idea, the abnormal memory B-cells in MS patients showed changes in genetic activity that are similar to what’s seen when EBV infects these cells. The researchers also found more DNA from the Epstein-Barr virus in lymph nodes from people with MS than in those without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Paralleled with the detection of an EBV signature and the known influence of EBV [on B-cell activity], our findings support B cell dysregulation as a central mechanism in MS pathogenesis [disease development],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Abnormalities found in B-cells, CD8 T-cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to changes in B-cells, the researchers also noted abnormalities in CD8 T-cells from some of the MS patients. CD8 T-cells are considered the assassins of the immune system, able to kill other cells that show signs of viral infection. Each CD8 T-cell is equipped with a specialized receptor that it uses to attack one specific target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a few of the MS patients had increased levels of CD8 T-cells targeting EBV. The highest numbers of anti-EBV CD8 T-cells were detected in a patient who had their lymph node sample collected during a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;disease relapse&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt; flare up due to increased inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyses of blood samples showed EBV-targeting CD8 T-cells were also present in the blood of patients who had these cells in their lymph nodes, implying that the EBV-attacking CD8 T-cells can move out of the lymph nodes to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these data suggest EBV may lead to dysregulation of B-cells and CD8 T-cells in MS patients, which may set the stage for MS-driving inflammation. Based on the available data, the researchers think that B-cells dysregulated by EBV may trigger a surge in activity of anti-EBV CD8 T-cells, which can move to the brain to trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that EBV-reactivated B cells expand in [lymph nodes] before a relapse, triggering an expansion of EBV-targeting memory CD8 T cells and their subsequent migration to the [brain and spinal cord], leading to a relapse,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They stressed, however, that this hypothesis was based on observations from a few patients, so more work is needed to validate this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

It wasn't clear how that child contracted the disease and they had not been traveling overseas, where measles is more common. The child recovered and was released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, the highest number of recent Long Island measles cases was in 2019, when there were three in Nassau and one in Suffolk, according to state health department data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check back for updates on this developing story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Robert Brodsky" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYmE4NjQ0OGItOGQ0NC00%3AOGItOGQ0NC00OWU5YmIw%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

We used NfL in our study because higher levels may indicate nerve cell damage, helping us understand the potential link between cardiovascular health and neurodegeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results highlight the importance of maintaining good CVH through managing risk factors, as it may help reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for increased heart disease education in the Black community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhana and her team also observed that participants with the highest CVH scores were predominantly White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this suggests that promoting cardiovascular health education in older adults, especially in the Black community, may help lighten the burden of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research shows that Black individuals have an increased risk for both &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6200348/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543531/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurodegenerative diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Improving cardiovascular health in older adults may help reduce the impact of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Black adults, who experience higher rates of cardiovascular disease. These findings emphasize the need for greater awareness and access to cardiovascular health resources in communities with largely Black individuals.”&lt;br&gt;— Anisa Dhana, MD, MSc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to further explore the link between cardiovascular health and neurodegeneration by examining additional biomarkers directly related to brain pathology, such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459119/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amyloid-beta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amyloid-beta&lt;/a&gt;.

I think this study is pretty interesting in the sense that it gives a potential mechanism by which that may happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would love to see a prospective study that would look at a high risk population and see if improving CVH scores lowered biomarkers and decreased risk of developing neurodegeneration,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/reducing-7-risk-factors-heart-disease-may-help-lower-alzheimers-biomarkers-neurodegenerative/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 17:21:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5fVDh1Z1h1cGFnd0VvbXB5em40MGZFV0RWaUU3QjdKWG05RDBMNFlqWW1rbEVpeW56ZTUxUEdMbDM2d2V6cmRXTjhxbzJlaVNzZjZXb21XNFBLdC1FYVpaTlRTcmJHX1V0elg1VVZGWmVaZw</guid></item><item><title>What to Know About Measles Cases in New York and New Jersey - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9MSWJ5VVZlQXJLUFh1TG81RmhsOXJueG04T2hsSVc0MHlpd2dyVUZ0MmJFcUxKRVJOeWJpTWEyNDZkYVRYSTkxamFEby1JQ0pVZEVDbERCMFNwa3BpNEozSjRLWGV1UlZyR1ZPQ0RNSnZjZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts are emphasizing the importance of vaccination against measles after three people in New York and three in New Jersey were diagnosed with the viral illness since the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s not unusual for sporadic cases of measles to be reported. Last year, 14 people in New York City were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with the illness&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional case elsewhere in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But an unfolding outbreak of the disease in West Texas and New Mexico has cast a spotlight on measles, which is highly contagious and can prove deadly and is sometimes heralded by a rash. That outbreak has emerged at the same time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;advocates unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;, has become President Trump’s secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;With measles so much in the news, residents of New York and New Jersey might be feeling concerned.

The first case was reported in January, the second in February and the third in mid-March. The first two patients have recovered and the third, an unvaccinated child under 5 years old from Suffolk County, was being treated at Cohen Children’s Medical Center in Queens, the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-03-11_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;state’s Department of Health said&lt;/a&gt; on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In New Jersey, all three people with confirmed cases of measles this year were not vaccinated against the virus. A person from Bergen County who had traveled internationally was the first of the three patients to be diagnosed, on Feb. 14, according to the state’s Health Department. Two people who had been in close contact with the first patient were diagnosed nearly a week later and were quarantined to minimize the chances of spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

under the age of eight should avoid consuming slushy ice &lt;a href="/topic/drinks"&gt;drinks&lt;/a&gt; containing the sweetening agent glycerol, researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of youngsters have become unwell as a result of so-called “glycerol intoxication syndrome”, which caused &lt;a href="/topic/symptoms"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like decreased consciousness and low blood sugar, according to a study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycerol is a naturally occurring alcohol and sugar substitute which helps slush drinks maintain their texture by preventing liquid from freezing solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, slush drinks – also known as slushies – containing the ingredient are not recommended for &lt;a href="/topic/children"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; under the age of four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, academics have called for the public health advice to be revisited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the review, published in Archives of Disease in Childhood, researchers at &lt;a href="/topic/university-college-dublin"&gt;University College Dublin&lt;/a&gt; looked at the medical notes of 21 &lt;a href="/topic/children"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and Ireland who fell ill after consuming a slushie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases took place between 2018 and 2024, with children’s ages ranging between two and almost seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youngsters were initially diagnosed with hypoglycaemia, or low blood sugar, after arriving at emergency departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest drinking slushies containing glycerol “may cause a clinical syndrome of glycerol intoxication in young children”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms included decreased consciousness, hypoglycaemia, lactic acidosis, which occurs when the body produces too much lactic acid, and hypokalaemia, or low potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added: “Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding the fact that younger children, especially those under eight years of age, should avoid slush ice drinks containing glycerol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advises against children under four consuming slush ice drinks containing glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also recommends consumption is limited to no more than one slush per day for children aged between five and 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time between drinking the slushie and becoming ill was known for 15 children, with 14 becoming unwell within an hour, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All 21 children recovered quickly and were discharged with advice not to drink slushies, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the group, 20 children followed this advice and had no further episodes of low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one child had another slushie at the age of seven and developed symptoms within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said: “There is poor transparency around slush ice drink glycerol concentration; estimating a safe dose is therefore not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is also likely that speed and dose of ingestion, along with other aspects such as whether the drink is consumed alongside a meal or during a fasting state, or consumed after high-intensity exercise, may be contributing factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added that “there are no nutritional or health benefits from these drinks” and “they are not recommended as part of a balanced diet”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recommendations on their safe consumption therefore need to be weighted towards safety,” academics said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To ensure safe population-level recommendations can be easily interpreted at the individual parental level, and given the variability across an age cohort of weight, we suggest that recommendations should be based on weight rather than age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternatively, the recommended age threshold may need to be higher (eight years), to ensure the dose per weight would not be exceeded given normal population variation in weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQOE1tUjdaVU9ncnJOenBwYkRLVmQySW1WbmlrSEUyalJUZTRtbTVkZV9YVEQ4T2tVWmJzVmZJNmxXUFI1bjhUNGFNcE1laXlFMVlEOGNBX1puT1l3cVFIdnJHUHRBeEtUTUxwbEVTSjFQSFJqWmg2TmZEa3pPVXBJYktBSlpGa3g4SXViYUxrMklFSFFhblRUV0Y0RHJ5N0VNRVVuejVWNmFUaDEzUmNFSzNkY0lpYlZPWTVydThoLVJwYTlUOWtjUg</guid></item><item><title>How Might This Cheap Painkiller Be Able To Stop Some Cancers From Spreading? - IFLScience</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNQmdwa3ZSRThrOHpvYU9oX2hDRkZ3X1luYm16NngtemVtYnVaNEpNWFU3alhpNEFIell3bFJ5Mkx6UTFYV0xwOUVnSXFlMnZDekRCZmNfdkhmQlRvUzhmTDFYeWNadkhvWUU5REZVSEhDOVR5VktYTGlHWXBYU1RWVVplWGl5TkFpd1JPZGxfcVNoODhlZXNxaGQwdWl3RUlLRGRCcTFGNi1GcHlo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;A team of researchers from the University of Cambridge believe they have uncovered the mechanism behind how aspirin, a common and inexpensive painkiller, might be able to stop cancer from spreading – and they made this discovery somewhat by accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they’d been looking at was how the immune system responds to metastasis. This is when single cancer cells break away from the initial tumor and spread elsewhere in the body, and it’s the primary cause of death for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-0134-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than 90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the loneliness of these rogue cells also makes them a prime target for T-cells. These are the front-line soldiers of the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-cancer-discovery-releases-brakes-on-immune-system-to-treat-stubborn-tumors-76650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;, designed to attack and destroy infected and cancerous cells, which is much easier when those cells are on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team was screening mice for immune system-related genes that might be involved in metastasis, they came across something interesting that involved T-cells – a gene that was suppressing their activity, known as &lt;em&gt;Arhgef1&lt;/em&gt;. When they studied mice that didn’t have &lt;em&gt;Arhgef1&lt;/em&gt; in their T-cells, those mice experienced less metastasis from the original tumor to the lungs and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Arhgef1&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t the root cause of the T-cell problem – there was something else controlling it, and that’s where the team uncovered a surprising link to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/plants-deal-with-stress-by-making-their-own-aspirin-64485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that the T-cell suppressing gene was being switched on by a protein produced by platelets, fragments of cells that help blood to clot. However, clotting can sometimes be a problem; aspirin reduces the amount of the clotting protein, called thromboxane A2 (TXA2), produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)60209-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; had suggested that taking a low dose of aspirin on a daily basis could also help to prevent metastasis – what this team had just figured out was how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a Eureka moment when we found TXA2 was the molecular signal that activates this suppressive effect on T cells. Before this, we had not been aware of the implication of our findings in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin. It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of enquiry than we had anticipated,” first author Dr Jie Yang said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/scientists-discover-how-aspirin-could-prevent-some-cancers-from-spreading" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were tested on two groups of mice with a type of cancer called melanoma: one group was given aspirin, while the other was not (known as a control group). The results showed that, compared to the control group, metastasis was less frequent in the mice that were given aspirin, and that this involved T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that everyone with cancer should run to the drugstore and stock up on aspirin. Not only is further research needed – carried out in humans, seeing as we’re not quite the same as mice – but regular aspirin use can also have &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/low-dose-aspirin/side-effects-of-low-dose-aspirin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, including stomach ulcers and bleeding more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the results are promising. If aspirin proves to be a viable treatment, its low cost would make it an attractive one, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aspirin, or other drugs that could target this pathway, have the potential to be less expensive than antibody-based therapies, and therefore more accessible globally,” Yang added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08626-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:21:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNQmdwa3ZSRThrOHpvYU9oX2hDRkZ3X1luYm16NngtemVtYnVaNEpNWFU3alhpNEFIell3bFJ5Mkx6UTFYV0xwOUVnSXFlMnZDekRCZmNfdkhmQlRvUzhmTDFYeWNadkhvWUU5REZVSEhDOVR5VktYTGlHWXBYU1RWVVplWGl5TkFpd1JPZGxfcVNoODhlZXNxaGQwdWl3RUlLRGRCcTFGNi1GcHlo</guid></item><item><title>Phase 1 trial of cell therapy seeks more Parkinson’s patients - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQUWZaOG1JUm1xTHhVeUxZdlNmNnZMZjN1dU9Xcm1PN1pMTjFYOFU1T0lHcXViLV9mTDZlTTBkQlFCU1g0VVcwVDMzeXc3TGhHVDJYRmFEZU8yNTVBdC1xTVRFR0RiVHhXaVEwN29RQW8tWXRDQWlyMkVodVZHM0RkaExyeUtaWkRmTVF1M2lacjNqU0owYmw1LWJHTFdmV05qc01fZjZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A small Phase 1 clinical trial testing a treatment approach that uses stem cells derived from a patient’s blood cells to replace the dopamine-producing neurons progressively lost in &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is looking for three more patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first-of-its-kind &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06422208"&gt;Phase 1 study (NCT06422208)&lt;/a&gt;, being conducted at Harvard Medical School’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has already enrolled and treated three of the six Parkinson’s patients it seeks to include. Eligible participants, ages 55 to 80, must have a &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosis of Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; for at least five years and show a response to dopaminergic medications, which are those that increase or mimic dopamine, a major brain signaling molecule involved in motor control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Seeing this transformational new patient cell-based replacement of their own [dopamine-producing] neurons come to fruition — from the very basic science breakthroughs in our lab to be completely translated into a clinical application for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease — is very gratifying,” Ole Isacson, a professor at Mass General Brigham and the researcher at McLean Hospital’s Neuroregeneration Research Institute (NRI) who led the preclinical research that laid the trial’s foundation, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/clinical-trial-novel-stem-cell-treatment-for-parkinsons"&gt;Mass General Brigham press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe this approach may open up a new treatment paradigm and lead to the development of many additional cell therapies to restore damaged brain systems and replace degenerated brain cells in other diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isacson isn’t involved in this trial, but is the innovator patent holder of the cell therapy technology and a cofounder of Oryon Cell Therapies, which has the license to the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of Parkinson’s is the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons, the nerve cells in the brain responsible for producing dopamine. Deficient levels of dopamine disrupt nerve signaling in the brain and lead to the &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that mark the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stem cells, which can give rise to all types of cells when exposed to the right molecular cues, could be used to restore the pool of dopaminergic neurons in Parkinson’s. Once in the brain, stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons would provide a new source of dopamine, easing motor symptoms and slowing the disease’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;A patient-derived cell therapy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isacson led pioneering work at NRI that showed stem cells &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.022438099"&gt;can turn into working dopaminergic neurons&lt;/a&gt; when transplanted into an affected brain region of a rat model of Parkinson’s and that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1010209107"&gt;patient-derived stem cells&lt;/a&gt; can be used for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patient-derived approach is based on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a type of stem cell generated from fully mature cells, like skin or blood cells, that are programmed back to a stem cell-like state, where they can give rise to almost every type of human cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing Phase 1 trial, blood cells from each participant are collected and reprogrammed into iPSCs. They are then grown in the lab in the presence of specific molecular cues that promote their maturation into dopaminergic neurons. The specialized neurons, which can be frozen until use, are then injected during a single surgical session into one side of the putamen, a region of the brain that controls movement and is affected in Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the patient’s own cells — called an autologous approach — avoids needing immunosuppressive medications to thwart immune reactions against transplanted cells from donors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial’s main goal is to check how safe this approach is by recording adverse events at 12 and 18 months after the surgery. Secondary goals include assessing score changes in the MDS Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale- Parts II and III, which measure the severity of motor symptoms and their impact on daily living, over 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will also measure changes in clinical measures of dyskinesia (uncontrolled movements) and cognitive function, along with on time without troublesome dyskinesia and off time, based on diary entries. On time refers to periods when motor symptoms are controlled, while off periods are when motor symptom worsen due to the effects of medication wearing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If results are positive, the researchers hope to launch a Phase 2a trial to test the therapy in a larger number of patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is extraordinary to witness that investigators at our institution can bring new treatments to patients through the entire process of laboratory ‘bench to bedside,’ and it inspires many investigators to similarly pursue their scientific and medical insights to reach patients in need,” said Kerry Ressler MD, PhD, the chief scientific officer at McLean Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="block"&gt;Suffolk County Health Commissioner Dr. Gregson Pigott said the child who was infected was less than a year old and not eligible to get the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) Vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials believe the child got it while traveling but the source of the infection is still under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The child was discharged from the hospital and is recovering at home, according to county health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;This is the third case of measles in the state this year and the first outside of New York City. State health officials said there is no connection between this case and other outbreaks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Pigott said Suffolk County's high vaccination rate against measles makes it unlikely the virus will spread to others in the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to data from the state health department, 82.6% of Suffolk County children have received at least one MMR shot by 2 years of age as of Jan. 1, 2025. That number is slightly higher than the overall state average of 81.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Officials are working to contact trace for any additional potential exposures to people who visited the pediatric emergency department at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park from March 3 to March 4 or visited an inpatient child on the Medicine 3 unit from March 3 to March 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Cohen Children's Medical Center is contacting patients who visited these areas at the time of potential exposure and has identified patients who are at high risk and may require timely treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A spokesperson for Cohen Children's Hospital said in a statement to News 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="left"&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"A pediatric patient was diagnosed with measles and treated at Cohen Children's Medical Center. We are actively working with public health officials under established exposure protocols to ensure no further cases arise from this incident. The situation underscores the critical importance of vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine, and the need for them to help prevent diseases like measles and minimize the risk of spreading these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The Suffolk County Department of Health has confirmed the child with measles did not attend daycare or school while infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus that is spread by coughing or sneezing into the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Individuals can catch the virus by breathing it in, or by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Complications may include pneumonia, encephalitis, miscarriage, preterm birth, hospitalization and death.

	The incubation period for measles is up to 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;People who are exposed to measles and have not been previously vaccinated should quarantine for 21 days after exposure. People who were exposed but who have been vaccinated with MMR do not need to quarantine but should self-monitor for 21 days and stay home if they develop symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;People diagnosed with measles should isolate until four days after the rash appears.

	Symptoms can include high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a rash of red, flat spots appears on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body.

	A person with measles can pass it to others as soon as four days before a rash appears and as late as four days after the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Typically, the first dose of the MMR vaccine is given to kids between 12 to 15 months old and the second dose is given between four and six years old as the child heads to school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the CDC, one MMR vaccine is about 93% effective at preventing measles and two doses are about 97% effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 Long Island</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNdnNUZEFHMmNKRUJWOFkwOEs0cFpVV1RPWVdfZ2EydFRxbkVoYS1wUkNIamFDa05rOGhLUHotSl9PcERlSUhnSzNXOFFYQktiUGozUFJvLXh0bHMwR3MwUHFKX05PZExsR0hiRFN1dHRacVR3OTZEeDVIeDJyc0cxR2ZZWmNWdklEYWJGd1h0a2U5bl9JQ2tSUjR5WV8xd3VOX0NN</guid></item><item><title>My body exploded with sores after breakthrough measles infection... why even the vaccinated should be worried - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxPRWJMWnFVRzVQX2ZtaFJRMmZCRWswWl84RzRKM1J2OHpQclpQMjNMdC1JZDQtM1M3ZGtDWmZNZzFsZk5UUmVrUkhIal9ZS1BQZTBnZ0lXUWJ0TTN4LWN3eUc4QS04MzFMUW45RUI1bk50VkZMWFVJclE1U1g0UUlkUjZScUVDbFExbzB2dVR5YjNIbnJkNm55TnV4X0NpYlVu0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1zb0JXeTJSMFc1ZlI5TDlNQ3lzMTkyNVJ4bHh1SDNIbkJWT1RSQzRnVUVhZUJadHhRWENNdHptUHpIaEFpekhMdmFLSVcxUnFxOFp0WHZuVmMtQVFzczJTVTd3eUpSd24zTFg2ZVRVbHFraFQxT3RLZW9kNTJ5VkFyMmNyV2xTZ1JYeXJzNUVpMG9tODVFWUhHYWZMeFFvQ3JtQmlja3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman who caught measles and suffered its brutal symptoms despite being vaccinated has issued a warning over the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The childhood MMR vaccine is 97 percent effective at stopping transmission, but measles is&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14087169/cdc-warns-trump-measles-vaccine-decline-rfjk-jr-health.html"&gt; so infectious&lt;/a&gt; it can still cause breakthrough infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy, a teacher from Ontario, was exposed when one of her unvaccinated students came to school with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The child fell sick and after diagnosis, health officials told Marcy and her class to isolate for up to 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy said she had been doubled-vaccinated as a child and received a booster after she was exposed, but over the next six days, she developed a fever that continued to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then the charac&lt;span&gt;teristic rash came. It erupted all over her face, and spread down her neck to her back, arms and legs — covering them in bright red spots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had a booster, and I still developed the infection — in fact I started to get a fever six days after my booster,' Marcy said on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marcy, pictured above, developed the measles after being exposed to an infected unvaccinated child in the school where she worked in Ontario, Canada&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I got a mild fever at first, and then it got worse and worse, instead of getting better, which should have been the first clue.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It comes amid a major outbreak in Texas, where more than 250 people have been infected while at least 29 have been hospitalized and two are reported to have died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of the patients, just five (or 2 percent) were vaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And an outbreak in Ontario that has sickened at least 177 people, mostly children at the state's schools. Marcy is a patient in this outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these patients, just eight were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine prevents infections in the vast majority of cases, but the CDC says online that about three in 100 people who receive the vaccine could still be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients tend to suffer a more mild infection, however, and avoid the worst effects of measles including encephalitis, or brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy, who revealed her case on &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marcyteaches/video/7472085787752893751"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, said that she had received two doses of the MMR vaccine as a child — which are administered at the ages of 12 months and four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But blood tests in the hospital revealed she had no antibodies against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, people who are fully vaccinated against measles will have antibodies in their blood, although in some cases these may not be picked up in tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians gave her a booster dose against measles and discharged her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is possible for immunity from the vaccine to wane over time, particularly in patients who are immunocompromised. It is not clear whether Marcy had any underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing her diagnosis online, she said: 'Hello, so I have, the measles', before gesturing to her rash-covered face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marcy is pictured above attending Taylor Swift's Eras tour more than a month before she was diagnosed with the disease. There is no risk that she could have been infected at the time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added in a comment: 'I was vaccinated as a child but my [tests] showed no evidence of immunity. They recommended a booster.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marcy said doctors initially thought her temperature was caused by the norovirus, before the rash erupted — leading to a measles diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn't feel the rash appear, but said that after a few days it started to itch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I developed a rash without even feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was at home, minding my business, and then my husband came home and took a look at my face and said, "What the heck happened to your face?!".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And I looked in the mirror and it's got a little worse, I am hoping the rash starts to get better tomorrow.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Taylor Swift super-fan is pictured above before she was diagnosed with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rash lasted for about five days before clearing, she said in the clip that was posted in mid-February and has been viewed nearly 20,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was able to return to work five days after her rash appeared, which is when someone is no longer infectious for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But said she was frequently exhausted and would come home from work and sleep immediately every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccination rates against measles have fallen in recent years amid false claims that the vaccine causes autism and mandates for Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Ontario, only about 90 percent of residents have been vaccinated against measles — statistics suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While in Gaines County, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-70ca0170-ff53-11ef-b1d6-0fa43b4ed9bd"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, at the center of America's latest outbreak, only about 82 percent of people have been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 16:03:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPRWJMWnFVRzVQX2ZtaFJRMmZCRWswWl84RzRKM1J2OHpQclpQMjNMdC1JZDQtM1M3ZGtDWmZNZzFsZk5UUmVrUkhIal9ZS1BQZTBnZ0lXUWJ0TTN4LWN3eUc4QS04MzFMUW45RUI1bk50VkZMWFVJclE1U1g0UUlkUjZScUVDbFExbzB2dVR5YjNIbnJkNm55TnV4X0NpYlVu0gGmAUFVX3lxTE1zb0JXeTJSMFc1ZlI5TDlNQ3lzMTkyNVJ4bHh1SDNIbkJWT1RSQzRnVUVhZUJadHhRWENNdHptUHpIaEFpekhMdmFLSVcxUnFxOFp0WHZuVmMtQVFzczJTVTd3eUpSd24zTFg2ZVRVbHFraFQxT3RLZW9kNTJ5VkFyMmNyV2xTZ1JYeXJzNUVpMG9tODVFWUhHYWZMeFFvQ3JtQmlja3c</guid></item><item><title>Wealthier Americans face lower risk of heart disease - UPI News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxPUjY1aFJfX2UtcUwyeW44WG0zblpsV2VhOVROSm53eUQwd3VtbUZGaDAzOHctZjFuWVVGa3FYUkdBUElqVlBfUExsakRONjF0cWpmWWdQbEZsTUY0TUFjUHZHSldWZ05MM3JLV3hXZzU3SlNIY2tTM0NTT3pFaHdFdF94U2UxM2diT2JNQnpfX2ZNX3M2OUpXa1hRUjVLemt4eDVNT002Szc2NDFCekM4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-12 col-lg-7"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
		
		&lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-to-do and better-educated Americans have far lower rates of heart disease than the rest of the population, a new study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 20% of high-income, college-educated Americans have less heart disease risk than others, and this gap has widened over the past two decades, researchers say.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The accumulation of economic and educational advantages appears to drive better health outcomes, rather than any single factor alone," lead researcher &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/salmaabdalla/" target="_blank"&gt;Salma Abdalla&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of public health at Washington University in St. Louis, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Wealth and education cluster among a small, advantaged group, while the majority of Americans face an increased risk of heart disease," she added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to wealthier, college-educated people, low-income folks who didn't graduate from college have a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.3 times higher risk of heart failure due to clogged arteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.2 times increased risk of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.3 times increased risk of a &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cardiovascular-diseases/heart-attack-symptoms-2659388594.html" target="_blank"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.1 times higher risk of angina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These disparities persisted even after adjusting for heart health factors like blood pressure, cholesterol and Body Mass Index (BMI, an estimate of body fat based on height and weight).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High income and advanced education consistently correlated with better heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the U.S. spends more on health care per person than any other high-income country, overall outcomes continue to lag behind, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life expectancy for the richest 1% of Americans is now 10 years higher than for the poorest 1%, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers analyzed 20 years of data gathered from nearly 50,000 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers cited a number of reasons why more well-to-do people have an advantage when it comes to heart health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poorer folks might suffer from more stress due to their economic insecurity, while higher-income or better-educated people might have more access to healthy behaviors and activities throughout their lives, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-to-do also might be better at taking prescribed medicines, have less exposure to environmental toxins and might benefit from stronger support systems, Abdalla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policies to promote broad access to economic opportunity and education are just as important as increased access to health care when it comes to protecting heart health, said senior researcher &lt;a href="https://schoolofpublichealth.washu.edu/people/sandro-galea-new/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Sandro Galea&lt;/a&gt;, dean of public health at Washington University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The continued widening of health disparities in the U.S. underscores the need for action," he said in a news release. "If we want to improve public health outcomes, we must address the root causes - economic opportunity, education and access to resources that support long-term health."
&lt;/p&gt;
