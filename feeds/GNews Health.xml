			&lt;p&gt;Gout is often associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-can-trigger-serious-cardiac-effects-in-young-people"&gt;drinking too much&lt;/a&gt; or not eating healthily enough, but research suggests genetics play more of a factor in developing the arthritic condition than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study, carried out by an international team of scientists, looked at genetic data collected from 2.6 million people across 13 different cohorts of DNA data. That number included 120,295 people with "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;prevalent gout&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing the genetic codes of the people with gout against the people without, the team found 377 specific &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"&gt;DNA regions&lt;/a&gt; where there were variations specific to having the condition – 149 of which hadn't been previously linked to gout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle and environmental factors are certainly still in play, the findings suggest genetics play a major role in determining whether or not someone gets gout – and the researchers think there may be more undiscovered genetic links still to be found, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lY77PhQV-vE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gout is a chronic disease with a genetic basis and is not the fault of the sufferer – the myth that gout is caused by lifestyle or diet needs to be busted," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Tony Merriman from the University of Otago in New Zealand, when the study was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/"&gt;Gout takes hold&lt;/a&gt; when there are high levels of uric acid in the blood, which then form sharp crystal needles in the joints. When the body's immune system starts to attack those crystals, it leads to significant pain and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetics is important in every stage of that process, the researchers suggest. Particularly, it affects the likelihood of the body's immune system attacking the crystals, and in the way &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"&gt;uric acid&lt;/a&gt; is transported around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_Zt95_TLmA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gout can come and go, but there are treatments available – and the authors behind the study think misconceptions can put people off getting those treatments. That's a real problem with cases of the condition &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrrheum.2015.91"&gt;rising and rising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This widespread myth causes shame in people with gout, making some people more likely to suffer in silence and not go and see the doctor to get a preventive drug that lowers urate in the blood and will prevent their pain," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of giving us a better understanding of the causes of gout, the study gives scientists more options to explore when it comes to treatments, particularly in terms of managing the body's immune response to the build up of uric acid. In fact, existing drugs could be repurposed for this job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151682" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-642x693.png" alt="Huge Study Shows Where Gout Comes From, And It Isn't What We Thought" class="size-medium wp-image-151682" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-642x693.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-385x415.png 385w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-768x828.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-600x647.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002.png 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151682" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gout on X-rays of a left foot in the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe.

Nevertheless, it gives us a much better sense of a health problem that's been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diseases-dickens-might-find-familiar-are-making-a-comeback-following-uk-s-austerity"&gt;afflicting people for centuries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope that, in time, better and more accessible treatments will become available with the new targets we identified," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman. "Gout deserves more health spend resource and greater prioritization in the health system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2024. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nutritionist explained that coughing after eating a meal can be a sign of something more serious than 'just acid reflux', increasing the risk of chronic asthma, sinus infections and even gastrointestinal cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Studies have shown that suffering acid reflux for several years can increase the risk of throat, oesophageal and thyroid cancers by &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10557881/"&gt;at least two-fold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The constant flow of stomach acid in the throat is thought to irritate the cells lining the throat which can lead to mutations that trigger the formation of cancerous tumours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have also shown that almost 28 per cent of people with laryngeal cancer suffered with acid reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Pelletier explained: 'When acid irritates your larynx [voice box], it triggers you body's natural defense: a cough reflex.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Pelletier suggested trying to avoid excessive throat clearing, which can irritate the lining of the throat further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoiding eating two to three hours before bed, reducing acidic foods and addressing stress can also alleviate symptoms and therefore the risk of cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Focus on calm, unhurried meals and chewing food well,' the expert advised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as acidic foods, like citrus fruits, vinegar and tomatoes, the dietitian also advised limiting carbonated drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of LPR include a sensation of a lump in the throat, hoarseness, frequent throat clearing, difficulty swallowing, a chronic cough and a sore dry throat &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because fizzy drinks can cause the belly muscles to swell, which puts pressure on the sphincter muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can also increase the acidity of the stomach, increasing the risk of reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consuming too much alcohol and coffee can also cause acid reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, at least half of patients who complain about chronic hoarseness have LPR, or 'silent' reflux. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acid reflux is caused by acid flowing into the oesophagus—the tube that connects the mouth and the stomach—irritating soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This happens when the muscular valve at the top of the stomach, which usually closes to prevent food and stomach juices escaping, doesn't work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While typical heartburn strikes at any time of day, usually after eating, silent reflux usually occurs at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he condition can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms mimic other conditions, such as chest infections and allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other common symptoms include feeling that too much mucus is collecting in the throat and excessive burping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnose the silent condition by using a camera to look at a patient's throat and voice box, which will often be inflamed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment usually involves making lifestyle changes—including cutting back on alcohol and quitting smoking—taking antacids to reduce stomach acid and in some cases surgery to tighten the valve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antacids such as Gaviscon and Rennie work by forming a 'raft' over the stomach contents so that if anything escapes back into the throat, it is less damaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rarer cases, patients may be referred to a gastroenterologist, particularly if doctors are concerned about the silent symptoms developing into serious health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS advises anyone who experiences symptoms that don't improve on their own for three weeks to contact their GP for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 11:23:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQWk51LVdWTVVJcmE4bEE2OGt6VUdSTHBNbi1lTmtwMmhGZk5vaGU5WkhyZUY1aXlBZlpjcDUyVXhaU1RRV3VjTm84VHZrNXRsLXlORnhfUEZCVkdSX2g0VUw5NF8yMmw0aEswMW1pOTB3dkdUVnRCMk5vbU1LOUdJNk1VOVlrSEZfXzB4TGZWTmtFekdWOTNLOHJwMNIBoAFBVV95cUxOeGdyZkhPN0JSQWxlblFGSjJWd0tCUWZDaTBDT21ibmU0SDdTdFZsM0YzNElTWndGMWI0cE94R1J1WHNzak9ZRzI2Ti10aGt6d1YzTWZheXppYlpkSlQ4dmtFUGx0WFd5Z0Jlb2w1Y2JFbEsyNXpUdkxHSHk3V2xDd0twejdfUDlOd0hHWmNyaHJCcG1tZjdpNHpLMDh2bkxa</guid></item><item><title>这种流行的饮食趋势可能是一种伪装的饮食失调- HuffPost | This Popular Diet Trend Could Be An Eating Disorder In Disguise - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNOWJmMXY3bE84dk5Qb0RIbERhVmFhS0o3UkhodXBUSGQ4R3VOejZKbW1pX2wyMDI5UU1jR2RfdGhNX25JNFVNakRNRFJnaVhyV2syYm9TRm5RbjhpWHRfR1doanRaQ1Z1RHVVVkxVOXg1RFNqUC03ZEhuMkE0TlVEUEEwWDUwOWFyU0hjWWlwLUJtQdIBlwFBVV95cUxNVmY4X3JMTXlqUEhSUWxuY09kbWhWNjhZaEdNUklzcDRSMktqd2JsSnRLMnFla3IxTUFzQXVLWFkyVVFITXJhTy1LZkZTNmtUMkxWOGZteWY1SGxRX0RObTNLTnl2NEZ2STRvYWxFZTZJR1dtOTVZbm5FYzdWV3FjX1RpSGN2SDktVjRkNmVuWEc1MmlIQzJJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Spend more than 30 seconds on TikTok, and you’ll hear fitness influencers sing the praises of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/body-intermittent-fasting_l_5e0a3220c5b6b5a713b22dcb" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="intermittent fasting" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68273bf7e4b0f10918e3174a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="5e0a3220c5b6b5a713b22dcb" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;.

If you are able to do intermittent fasting without obsessive thoughts about food or body image, and without rigid food rules that impair your daily functioning, then it might be OK. For everyone else, it can quickly spiral into disordered eating. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This might look like “experiencing intense anxiety about breaking ‘rules,’ obsessing over food, feeling shame about eating, avoiding social events involving food or using fasting as a way to control weight at all costs,” according to O’Melia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“No one sets out thinking, ‘I want to develop an eating disorder,’ but for individuals with certain genetic, psychological and environmental risk factors, seemingly healthy choices can inadvertently lead to dangerous patterns,” O’Melia said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs intermittent fasting is triggering disordered eating include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compensatory behaviors, like excessive exercise or purging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding social meals that don’t fall in your eating window.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing preoccupation with food, body image or weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low energy, mood disturbances, sleep issues or trouble concentrating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only eating “safe” or “healthy” foods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating in isolation; secrecy or hiding of eating behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Binge eating symptoms, feeling of loss of control when eating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling anxiety, guilt or shame if you eat outside your “allowed” window.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiencing medical issues such as fainting, amenorrhea, GI distress, or fatigue, dizziness, weakness, irritability or obsessional thinking about food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Negative or emotionally reactive responses to expressions of concern about changes in behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any additional or increasing behaviors that can be associated with eating disorders, such as laxative use, changes in exercise patterns, developing food rules about the types of food eaten rather than just the times that food is eaten.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If fasting starts to feel like an obligation instead of a choice — or affects your ability to enjoy life — it may be time to reevaluate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s critical to remember that the human body is incredibly complex — and it thrives when treated with compassion, not punishment,” O’Melia said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Shouldn’t Do Intermittent Fasting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Most people” should not do intermittent fasting, Mehr said, and “especially those with a history of eating disorders, mental health struggles or nutrient deficiencies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;O’Melia added, “Anyone with a personal history or a significant family history of an eating disorder, disordered eating, body dysmorphia, significant anxiety or depression, trauma history, or compulsive exercise patterns should avoid intermittent fasting.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have a fragile relationship with food and could be affected by self-imposed rules or restrictions around when you can eat, then intermittent fasting is not for you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our bodies are designed to let us know when they need fuel,” Mehr explained. “Ignoring those cues can lead to preoccupation with food, disrupted metabolism and emotional distress. [Intermittent fasting] is like telling someone to only use the bathroom during certain hours — it creates fixation, not freedom.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our experts agreed that no one should do intermittent fasting without close guidance by their medical provider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try This Instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our experts were quick to slam any structured diet or food group restriction (other than for allergies).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Eating should be a source of nourishment and pleasure, not a battleground,” O’Melia explained. “I encourage patients to focus on balanced meals, variety, satisfaction and listening to their bodies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Both experts recommend intuitive eating that listens to hunger and fullness cues. This includes eating a wide variety of foods without guilt (yes, desserts too!); respecting body diversity; participating in joyful movement; managing your stress and getting enough sleep; and centering mental, emotional and social health alongside physical health.

            Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00053b6mcl4t8okc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration’s deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00063b6mxrs6onqb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We just don’t know why there haven’t been cases,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “I think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren’t being detected.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00073b6mjgbiwf7i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The H5N1 bird flu &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-humans-animals-deaths-ae01d3717783f0cf41e23f3fedb97017" target="_blank"&gt;has been spreading widely&lt;/a&gt; among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00083b6m3kqx8zyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. — most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00093b6mlbnmqq7f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in &lt;a href="https://www.centralnevadahd.org/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/media-center/ODH-News-Releases/ohio-reports-first-human-case-of-bird-flu-021225" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/wyomings-first-human-bird-flu-case-confirmed/" target="_blank"&gt;Wyoming&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000a3b6m3656avjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation’s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000b3b6m10o7stna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000c3b6mvhtg5jps@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural — maybe temporary — decline in cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000d3b6mzx5bomz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000e3b6muk4nhhzf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" target="_blank"&gt;limited activity&lt;/a&gt; recently.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000f3b6mldvrew71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New infections are still being detected in &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" target="_blank"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank"&gt;cattle&lt;/a&gt;, but not as frequently as several months ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000g3b6mrjizlzc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Given the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it’s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,” the CDC said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000h3b6mi0uzqs18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn’t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000i3b6mu1tz3fy5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think that anybody’s hiding anything,” said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000j3b6m52qjrvro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Osterholm and some other experts think it’s likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000k3b6mytznh2nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government’s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000l3b6moojfl10q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000m3b6mcjmdrexp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA’s Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000n3b6mi39uhbrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said “targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000o3b6mjgel3w2y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000p3b6m5321zubp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I can’t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmawd6z5d000a3b6m5o6c379q@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="cdc-says-the-risk-to-the-general-public-remains-low" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        CDC says the risk to the general public remains low
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000q3b6mqeycqzh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000r3b6mvnq30cii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pandemic-flu/php/monitoring/irat-virus-summaries.html" target="_blank"&gt;an agency assessment&lt;/a&gt; said there is a “moderate risk” that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000s3b6mgukqxmpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, research is continuing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000t3b6mmju6dg17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas A&amp;amp;M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000u3b6mfojnnfwv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000v3b6m9sk7qag8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have had very good participation,” Douphrate said. “They have been very willing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000w3b6myc0pmgzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similar surveillance is “urgently needed” among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000x3b6msekfbi4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-dairy-farmers-barb-petersen-07bd5accb01441bc5d279464271d2371" target="_blank"&gt;the first signs&lt;/a&gt; that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000y3b6mxdiw2cw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu — or whether the virus can spill over into people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j000z3b6mvrgopec6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavh199j00103b6mz5hs7tvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s easy to downplay something because that’s usually what humans do,” she said. “But what we really need to be doing is ramping up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Are any types of alcohol less risky than others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’ve heard that &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/well/eat/red-wine-heart-health.html" title=""&gt;red wine is better for you&lt;/a&gt; than beer or liquor, or that clear liquor like vodka or gin is less harmful than dark liquor like rum or whiskey, we have bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Alcohol is alcohol,” said Jürgen Rehm, a senior scientist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. Drinking any type of alcohol, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/well/mind/alcohol-health-effects.html" title=""&gt;in any amount&lt;/a&gt;, is bad for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, experts say, it’s sometimes not reasonable or even practical for people to avoid alcohol entirely. So if you’re going to drink, there are some strategies you can take to reduce your risk, and to avoid some of the other unpleasant effects of drinking, like hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-d522b46"&gt;Why Alcohol Is So Harmful&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When you have a drink, your body turns the ethanol that’s present in the alcoholic beverage into a “really nasty substance” called acetaldehyde, which can damage your DNA, said Timothy Stockwell, an alcohol researcher at the University of Victoria in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many tissues in the body, including those in the mouth, throat, liver, colon and breasts, are susceptible to this harm.

But we do know they have been found from the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.geochemicalperspectivesletters.org/article1829/#Fig3" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;depths of the Mariana Trench&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastics-remote-places-microplastics-earth-mount-everest" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;heights of Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt;. And we know that plastic is accumulating in our bodies, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat — it’s in it,” said Richard Thompson, a marine biologist at the University of Plymouth who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1094559" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;coined the term “microplastics”&lt;/a&gt; in a 2004 paper. “We’re exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-5e044a2"&gt;What are microplastics?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists generally define “microplastics” as pieces less than 5 millimeters long.

Within a couple of weeks, she was debilitated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her vomiting exacerbated the excruciating pain in her skull. She spent nearly every hour in bed with the covers pulled over her head, blocking out any sliver of light. Even the clock on her microwave was too much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I went from training for a marathon, raising two teenagers and having a job to essentially being bedridden,” said Carrigan, 41, of Bakersfield, California, who works for Kern County Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Her condition continued to get worse and doctors couldn’t provide answers — until her third visit to the hospital, when one doctor asked her if she’d had any respiratory symptoms before the headaches started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She had. About a month before the headaches started, Carrigan had what she thought was a typical cold — though she recalled that her cough lingered a bit longer than normal and she went on to develop a rash on her thighs. Both symptoms got better without treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250519-Brynn-Carrigan-Zion-Angels-Landing-Hike-ew-408p-2ccf8a.jpg" alt="Brynn Carrigan on the Zion Angels Landing Hike in Zion National Park."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Brynn Carrigan hiking Angels Landing in Zion National Park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Brynn Carrigan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These turned out to be key pieces of information. A biopsy of her spinal fluid revealed that Carrigan had coccidioidal meningitis, a rare complication of a fungal infection called Valley fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I knew something was wrong but never in a million years did I think it would be something so serious,” Carrigan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Valley fever, or coccidioidomycosis, is caused by inhaling &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; spores, a type of fungi endemic to the hot, dry climate of the southwestern United States. Climate change is creating drier soils that are inching farther east, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/valley-fever-historically-found-only-southwest-spreading-can-devastati-rcna64313" target="_blank"&gt;expanding the range&lt;/a&gt; of the fungi. Valley fever is increasingly being diagnosed outside its usual territory and cases have been rising across the Western U.S. While Arizona still sees the highest number each year, California is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/php/statistics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;closing the gap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;From 2000 through 2016, California had 1,500 to 5,500 cases a year. From 2017 through 2023, those numbers &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;jumped&lt;/a&gt; to 7,700 to 9,000 annual cases. Preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; for 2024 puts the count at more than 12,600 — the highest the state has ever seen and about 3,000 more cases than the previous record, in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Early data shows California is on track for another record-breaking year. Already, the state has &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;logged&lt;/a&gt; more than 3,000 confirmed cases of Valley fever statewide, more than there were at the same time last year and nearly double what cases were at this time in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There is no question that the number of cases of coccidioidomycosis is enormously higher than before,” said Dr. Royce Johnson, chief of the division of infectious disease and director of the Valley Fever Institute at Kern Medical in California. “If you want to see me, right now you’d have to wait until July, and that goes for my colleagues, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drought cycles driving spread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Carrigan lives in Kern County, a dry, sprawling region that sits between two mountain ranges at the southern end of California’s Central Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The county has already recorded &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;at least 900 Valley fever cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year and has been ground zero for the fungal infection in the state for the last three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But the consistently high cases in places like Kern County are not driving the upward trend in California, said Gail Sondermeyer Cooksey, an epidemiologist at the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, new hot spots are emerging along the edges of the Central Valley — in Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties, along California’s central coast. Cases in Contra Costa County, just east of Berkeley, have &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;tripled&lt;/a&gt; so far this year compared with the same time in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It appears to be spreading out,” Sondermeyer Cooksey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many factors likely influence how well &lt;em&gt;coccidioides &lt;/em&gt;spores multiply and spread, “but one thing we have identified as a big driver of those peaks and dips is drought,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; in The Lancet Planetary Health found that drought years suppress Valley fever cases, but multiple years of drought followed by a wet winter causes cases to rebound sharply. This shift in weather patterns, which is driven by climate change, appears to largely influence where new Valley fever hot spots emerge. Longer, drier summers can also &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0821" target="_blank"&gt;shift transmission season&lt;/a&gt;, when the spores spread, from late summer and early winter to earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We’re seeing wetter wets and drier dries across the Southwest, but California is seeing that to a higher degree,” said Jennifer Head, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, who studies Valley fever and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Arizona, new hot spots are popping up in places in the state that have a climate more similar to California’s than elsewhere in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The highest increases in Arizona are in the northern plateau regions, which, similar to California, have historically been colder and wetter,” Head said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closely tracking Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The climate patterns expanding Valley fever’s range in California are the same ones that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/climate-change/california-fires-weather-climate-change-rcna190892" target="_blank"&gt;drive increasingly intense wildfires&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists are still trying to understand how fires may worsen Valley fever risk, but some research has shown &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196%2823%2900046-3/fulltext#:~:text=A%20population%2Dbased%20study%20in%20California%20found%20that,the%20preceding%201%20month%20and%203%20months." target="_blank"&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; between wildfire smoke and higher rates of diagnoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Sondermeyer Cooksey said the state health department warned first responders to January’s devastating fires in Los Angeles County of the potentially increased risk of Valley fever in the area because of the fires. There have been past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7134a4.htm" target="_blank"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; among wildland firefighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s some limited evidence that wildfires may spread the &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; spores. In a 2023 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10402968/#:~:text=We%20find%20limited%20evidence%20that,pre%2D%20and%20post%2Dwildfires" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers looked at 19 fires across California and observed higher rates of Valley fever following three of those fires. These fires tended to be larger, located near population centers and burned areas that had high Valley fever transmission prior to the fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not entirely clear whether there is a link between wildfires and Valley fever, but what is important to know is that &lt;em&gt;coccidioides&lt;/em&gt; live in the dirt and anything that disturbs the dirt can exacerbate Valley fever,” Sondermeyer Cooksey said. “Fires do that, then we have all of the reconstruction projects that also disturb soil.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Peak Valley fever season hasn’t happened yet this year. Because reconstruction efforts are disturbing soil in the burn scar, Sondermeyer Cooksey said state and local public health departments “are closely tracking the numbers” in areas hit by January’s fires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cases after Lightning in a Bottle festival &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diagnosing Valley fever is tricky, mostly because its symptoms overlap with other respiratory illnesses including flu, Covid and pneumonia. If someone experiences those symptoms, it’s important for them to let their doctor know if they’ve been around disturbed soil or dust — in a construction zone, camping, hiking, working outside or at a festival — or in an area known to have Valley fever, Sondermeyer Cooksey said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Symptoms typically show up one to three weeks after exposure, but it can take as long as eight weeks, so people may not make an immediate connection, Head, of the University of Michigan, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR24-22.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;19 people&lt;/a&gt; who attended the Lightning in a Bottle music festival — which is being held in Kern County again this month — were diagnosed with Valley fever later in the summer. At least eight were hospitalized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Lightning in a Bottle is right in the middle of the endemic region, that’s one of the hot spots for the disease,” said Dr. George Thompson, director of the &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/valley-fever/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Valley Fever&lt;/a&gt; at the University of California, Davis, adding that the vast majority of people who attend will not get an infection, but people who aren’t from an endemic area may be at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Thompson said it’s clear that he and his colleagues across the state are treating more patients for the infection. Only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/yellow-book/hcp/post-travel-evaluation/post-travel-respiratory-infections.html" target="_blank"&gt;1% of cases&lt;/a&gt; result in life-threatening meningitis or other complications, as Carrigan’s did, but once a person is infected, they never clear the fungus from their body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There is no drug that kills cocci, so what keeps you from being ill is your immune response,” Johnson, of Kern Medical, said. To treat the infection, people are given antifungals “long enough for a person’s immune system to figure out how to control it. If you then do something to disrupt that immunity, it can start growing again, and that can surface years later,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Carrigan spent the last year on an intense regimen of anti-fungal treatments. During the first few months, she lost most of her hair and eyelashes and barely recognized herself in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She’s now made a full recovery and even ran a marathon this spring, but she still takes anti-fungal medication. Carrigan said she wants more people to understand both the &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/pages/Coccidioidomycosis.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;warning signs of Valley fever&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of telling their doctor if they’ve been somewhere with cases, which could help people get a faster diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Even if it’s only 1% of cases, as we see cases increase, the number of people who experience complications is going to rise, too,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQVDVIZ1VxSmNrVjZDVEtYcEp1RVJvUUxqR08zcVhZZEVOaHk2OHBuQWJPY0NMX3M0M1FlZEFPNTNEWjVNUzY2ZXMteGxYdDZVVm5tSk84dGt1SE1xYVRzM215ZEFPemMwOUIyTnF4ODFFbDRLSm1MU2wtTEp5dEJNNjJfMDZpa3FtMTdVOGZzWElJeUgxb1NHZVNtZi01dHM2Wm1kM3FWQ1N5U2owRWlYbUZHLVQ2QdIBVkFVX3lxTE03YTFUamZ2VDYtR2RmX0dZV2drZEhxRV9VR0FSZTlVaUdpOGQ0NjJSVDB5TjFtbWdQNnh5czBsUFBTU01Ibk1UVVNUaUk3MXM0M2d5anBn</guid></item><item><title>告别节食！这种简单的分子可以帮助您长寿！ -玻璃年鉴 | Say Goodbye to Dieting!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the United States, research focused on aging may hold the key to extending our lifespan. Scientists suggest that a specific nutritional adjustment could have positive effects on longevity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Key: Isoleucine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, the scientific community has been exploring aging, but so far, &lt;strong&gt;no one has discovered a magic cure&lt;/strong&gt; to counteract the effects of time. Nowadays, many studies target the cellular level, aiming not to reverse but to adapt the body’s mechanisms to aging. One potential avenue for this adaptation is through diet, as indicated by a study published in the journal Cell Metabolism in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, led by the University of Wisconsin at Madison (USA), flew under the radar at the time and focuses on &lt;strong&gt;isoleucine, a very special amino acid&lt;/strong&gt;. Isoleucine is classified as an “essential” amino acid, one of the twenty major amino acids encoded by the genome for protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the human body does not produce isoleucine, and it &lt;strong&gt;must be obtained through diet&lt;/strong&gt;—primarily from fish, meat, eggs, legumes, dairy products, and some nuts. Essential for proper bodily function, this amino acid aids in tissue repair, energy production, and impacts several metabolic functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Risky Modification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the American study was to test the effects of reducing isoleucine intake in mice. According to the findings, male mice experienced an &lt;strong&gt;average lifespan increase of 33%&lt;/strong&gt;, while females saw a 7% increase. Other beneficial effects noted included better regulation of blood sugar levels, an increase in muscle mass, and a reduction in the incidence of certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present, there is no proof that similar results could apply to humans. It’s worth noting that our bodies are more complex than those of mice, and more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;altering the intake of an amino acid appears risky&lt;/strong&gt; as it could disrupt some biological functions undesirably. Therefore, the study’s authors do not recommend a sudden and/or uncontrolled reduction of isoleucine but instead suggest avoiding excess by choosing foods that contain it more carefully. The researchers are also considering developing a treatment to modify the biological activity of isoleucine or to modulate its absorption without making significant dietary changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these findings are promising, &lt;strong&gt;several uncertainties remain&lt;/strong&gt;. For instance, the exact mechanisms in mice need to be accurately translated to human physiology, and the optimal dose or level of isoleucine needed to increase lifespan without causing long-term issues must still be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Glass Almanac</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 06:25:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTWREdmtoRG1FSkRuaDk1T2dzYjQxR0w0S0JYeEpfN09OQl9pTF9ScUoyNFJqNUZ5ZTNoZXVrOHdYSVE5LWstbzhpNDUxMUduREFlc2xnT3VvaHJBUlpnLXl2eGpGNGNMLURUeFo0TXZjMVZuSHZHb1NxSkdyb0VwclVER1hqaVRJekhIdzdObWtpNFdtd1ZoZlZQTEo</guid></item><item><title>重磅研究揭示了常见食物如何“推动自闭症的流行” -《每日邮报》 | Bombshell study reveals how common foods 'are driving epidemic of AUTISM' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common food in 70 percent of American diets may be fueling mental illness, dementia and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A major new review has linked ultra-processed foods (UPFs) - which includes everything from chips to protein bars - to rising rates of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14719863/Scientists-discover-toxic-substance-hiding-100-peoples-brains-explains-rise-dementia-US.html"&gt;hidden culprit could be microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, tiny plastic particles now found in soaring levels inside UPFs — and increasingly, in the human brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have shown UPFs are more susceptible to microplastics as contamination can occur during processing and packaging of the foods - which are often in plastic wrappers and containers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Co-lead author of the new paper Dr Nicholas Fabiano, from the University of Ottawa, said: 'We're seeing converging evidence that should concern us all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultra-processed foods... contain significantly higher concentrations of microplastics than whole foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Recent findings show these particles can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in alarming quantities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another author of the article, Dr Wolfgang Marx from Deakin University's Food &amp;amp; Mood Center, said there is 'remarkable overlap' in the way UPFs and microplastics harm mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) - which includes everything from chips to protein bars - has been linked to rising rates of neurological disorders (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano, from the University of Ottawa, said: 'We're seeing converging evidence that should concern us all&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'This hypothesis is particularly compelling because we see remarkable overlap in biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultra-processed foods have been linked to adverse mental health through inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruptions to neurotransmitter systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Microplastics appear to operate through remarkably similar pathways.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the new article, published in Brain Medicine, the authors reviewed studies that looked at the relationship between ultra-processed foods, microplastics and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the studies included in the article was a recent one&lt;span&gt; published in The British Medical Journal. It found people who consumed UPFs had a 22 percent higher risk of depression, a 48 percent higher risk of anxiety and a 41 percent higher risk of poor sleep - which can cause a cascade of poor health outcomes itself. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And another study included found microplastics and nanoplastics induce oxidative stress on the central nervous system, which may cause cellular damage and increase the vulnerability to neurological disorders.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Based on the authors' review of the current data, they concluded the high levels of microplastic contamination in ultra-processed foods could be why they have such detrimental impacts on health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists think ultra-processed foods damage your gut, and that can in turn damage with your brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This connection — called the gut-brain axis — means when your gut's out of whack, your mood and mental health can take a hit too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has also shown that these junk foods are full of artificial sweeteners, which may throw off the way your brain cells talk to each other and disrupt hormones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of that, microplastics in the foods could be linked to depression and anxiety, with researchers warning they might harm brain development, trigger inflammation, and disrupt sleep and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ultra-processed foods contain high concentrations of microplastics. Contamination can occur during processing and packaging of the foods - which are often in plastic wrappers and containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Microplastics are small plastic pieces that are less than 5mm in size and insoluble in water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microplastics in UPFs could also be fueling a rise in dementia, researchers of a separate study believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study from earlier this year - that was not included in this week's article review - analyzed brain tissue from 54 autopsies and discovered every brain had microplastics in it - equivalent in mass to a plastic spoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found individuals diagnosed with dementia exhibited up to 10 times more microplastics in their brain tissue compared to those without this condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the study does not directly connect them, it does show a relationship between the accumulation of microplastics and neurological disorders. SAYS WHO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An author of that study said microplastic levels in the human brain have increased by 50 percent over the past eight years - and rates of dementia have also increased, with cases expected to nearly double by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics can cross the blood-brain barrier, a protective shield that typically prevents harmful substances from entering the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once inside, these tiny particles may trigger inflammation, disrupt neurological signaling, and potentially contribute to the development of neurological disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While scientists are still investigating the direct impact of microplastics on human health, animal studies have shown that exposure can lead to behavioral changes, memory impairment, and reduced motor coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another separate 2022 study found people who ate the most UPFs had a 25 percent faster rate of executive function decline and a 28 percent faster rate of overall cognitive impairment compared to people who are the least amount of processed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe the high content of sugar, salt and fat in UPFs promotes harmful inflammation throughout the body, including the brain, which could harm cognition and memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another neurological condition on the rise that could be tied to microplastics in UPFs is autism, which affects one in 31 kids in the US. This is a dramatic increase from one in 150 children two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have posited UPFs can negatively impact the gut microbiome, and an off-balance microbiome has often been often in children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is also some evidence UPFs can alter gene expression that leads to changes in brain development and function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Processed foods can also be high in levels of heavy metals, including mercury and lead, which may contribute to or exacerbate symptoms of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no known cause of autism.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While preliminary research has been conducted on the association of microplastics and autism, scientists say there is not enough information to draw conclusions and more research needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To address the issue of microplastics, the authors of the most recent article proposed the Dietary microplastic Index (DMI). A system that would quantify exposure to microplastics through food consumption and assess the microplastic content and risk of accumulation based on the foods people eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Stefan Bornstein, who authored a peer-reviewed research paper on removing microplastics from the body, said: 'While we need to reduce our exposure to microplastics through better food choices and packaging alternatives, we also need research into how to remove these particles from the human body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his paper, he posits that a process called apheresis could remove microplastics from the body. This is a medical procedure that removes specific components of blood from the body - like plastics - and returns the remaining components - such as the building blocks that make up blood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Compared to other states, that puts Utah at No. 21 in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to prostate cancer deaths, Utah is well above average: 1 in 40 Utah men die from the disease. That puts Utah at No. 4 in the country for prostate cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is Utah men not getting screened as early as they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons for that could be Utahns' access to health care, especially in rural towns with older populations who live farther away from where they get treatment. It's part of the reason then-Vice President Biden visited the Huntsman Cancer Institute back in 2016 — to unite researchers to eliminate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons for that could be Utahns' access to healthcare, especially in rural towns with older populations who live farther away from where they get treatment. It's part of the reason then-Vice President Biden visited the Huntsman Cancer Institute back in 2016 — to unite researchers to eliminate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what's the solution? Johnson said men need to be screened for prostate cancer starting at age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's now a simple blood test you can take, he said. But if you have a family history of prostate cancer, you may want to get screened sooner. At a bare minimum, 50 is the age men need to start talking with doctors about screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still not sure?

Utah has been taking steps to address the vaping crisis, including implementing restrictions on flavored vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While electronic cigarettes have been marketed as a safer alternative to smoking, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ntr/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/ntr/ntaf067/8079085?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;a recent study&lt;/a&gt; noted that's not the case. Johns Hopkins researchers looked at health data from 250,000 people over four years. The findings showed that those who used e-cigarettes had a higher risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than those who didn't smoke or use e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a leading cause of death worldwide and is typically irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once it's there, it's there, and really the main prevention is no tobacco, no e-cigarettes," Blagev said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the long-term effects of e-cigarettes are still being studied, vaping has been linked to cardiovascular disease, reproductive harm and neurological issues, such as strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teenagers are more susceptible to nicotine addiction than adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having this habit and these behaviors early on can have real consequences in the longer term," Blagev said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blagev emphasized the importance of parents having conversations about vaping with their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As parents, really one of the most important things we can do is have the lines of communication open," Blagev said. "We really want to help our kids be able to make decisions and navigate these challenging situations, and be set up for success and really long-term health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 02:37:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNckU2eFdTclg0N2hkeWlhTVF5N0VLOVlHSW5yRVVuNVlHcThDUVpZNnRnUDhYLXQ5U2NWSWtIdWFfWFRDZUYwbE5ETWo4RjhGWnZoWjNKNXNqYzJJbzdId2tZUDQzRUM0QjU1TW1VVlhoMndVMC0yVm9HMEpIMmpZWTcydWVHTURlRDVfWDZPNGxMYW9PQnNUdUI4cVFwNHhHanlPOUV4Zw</guid></item><item><title>胃肠道医生故意限制自己饮食的6种流行食品和饮料- BuzzFeed | 6 Popular Foods And Beverages That GI Doctors Purposely Limit In Their Own Diets - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRE5CX1M3VTNhVlpqaUxDNnVOVEJpbk5qY0czejd0NmNuRjJLTzJzX2x0SExfNU9janhQMHJtMWZHellUSjBLUjJvZTBmUks2b0otTFVQQloxTTNXcm9JdlJ2N0d4ZFdiakFmZDV2cHV0cVh2M2pmQ1hEVWg4Nk92b1podXZkNTVnd0lFUkk5bmdFenBvdmVWTjEydw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. &lt;a href="https://physiciandirectory.brighamandwomens.org/details/1727/shilpa-grover-gastroenterology_hepatology_and_endoscopy-boston" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Shilpa Grover&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the onco-gastroenterology program in the division of gastroenterology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, refined grains aren’t great for your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies that have evaluated dietary patterns have clearly shown that a high intake of red and processed meat and refined grains is associated with an increased risk of [inflammatory pouches in the digestive tract] called diverticulitis,” she said. “Contrary to what was thought earlier, nuts, corn, and popcorn are not associated with an increase in the risk of developing diverticulosis, or complications like diverticulitis or bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But your gut health isn’t all you have to watch out for when it comes to eating a diet high in red meat and refined grains. “Those same diets recommended to decrease the risk of health conditions such as diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/coronary-artery-disease" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767" data-affiliate="true"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt; and cancer, including colorectal cancer, are also likely to decrease the risk of diverticulitis,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re mourning a loss of identity as you contemplate spending your summer months without a single hot dog, worry not: A hot dog here and there won’t destroy your gut health. Just go easy on them — and maybe add sauerkraut for some gut-boosting benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-digestion-health_l_6411d77ce4b0a3902d2e1014" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7879767"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber helps minimize blood sugar spikes and is essential for diabetes management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chickpeas, chia seeds, edamame, raspberries and avocados are top high-fiber foods for diabetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increase fiber intake gradually to minimize digestive side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057241/top-high-fiber-foods-you-need-in-your-life/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; plays a crucial role in supporting overall health, particularly for individuals with diabetes. One of its most significant benefits is its ability to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;help regulate blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. By slowing the digestion and absorption of glucose, fiber prevents sharp spikes and crashes in blood sugar, promoting a steadier, more controlled rise. Unlike carbohydrates that are broken down into glucose for energy, fiber passes through our digestive system largely intact, helping to moderate how quickly glucose enters the bloodstream.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This makes it an essential component of managing diabetes effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, consuming whole-grain bread instead of white bread introduces additional fiber and nutrients, slowing the digestive process and leading to a more gradual increase in blood sugar. Incorporating fiber into meals doesn’t always require a complete diet overhaul—it can often be as simple as adding a high-fiber ingredient to complement your dish. With so many high-fiber foods available, it’s easy to find options that suit your preferences and dietary needs. Let’s explore some of the best high-fiber foods that can help you manage blood sugar while keeping your meals balanced and delicious.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans) are an excellent high-fiber addition to any salad, sauté or grain bowl.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are a fiber powerhouse. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170554/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One tablespoon of chia seeds (1/2 oz.)&lt;/a&gt; contains about 70 calories, 2 grams of protein, 4 grams of fat and almost 5 grams of fiber in just one small spoonful!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study found that people with both type 2 diabetes and hypertension who included 40 grams of chia seeds every day for 12 weeks experienced a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure compared to those who did not add chia seeds to their diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many different ways to incorporate edamame into your diet. Add ½ cup shelled edamame to any salad for a plant-based protein boost. You can boil frozen edamame for 5 minutes, drain and season with salt, and enjoy it as a high-protein snack at any time. Going out for sushi? Order the edamame as your appetizer. Starting the meal out with a high-protein, high-fiber appetizer can help you feel satisfied until your entrees arrive, and may help you enjoy your meal in more balanced portions.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Raspberries are an excellent fruit option for those with diabetes. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/167755/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One cup of raspberries&lt;/a&gt; contains about 64 calories, 14 grams of carbs and 8 grams of dietary fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Research suggests that red raspberry consumption is linked to improvements in glucose handling and insulin sensitivity, though more robust, human studies are needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are tons of ways to incorporate raspberries into your diet. Enjoy them raw, add them to salads, sprinkle over a parfait or combine them with chia seeds to make our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/255160/peanut-butter-chia-berry-jam-english-muffin/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia Berry Jam&lt;/a&gt;. That said, fresh raspberries can be expensive and spoil quickly, so opt for frozen ones to save some money and extend their shelf life.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Avocados are known for their healthy fat and omega-3 content, but don't overlook them as an excellent source of fiber, too. &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/171705/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One half of an avocado&lt;/a&gt; contains almost 7 grams of fiber—that's 33% of the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;daily recommended amount&lt;/a&gt; for women and 23% for men. One half of an avocado also contains about 15 grams of unsaturated fat, which is a type of fat that has some heart-healthy benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Unsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt; can help to lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol and raise HDL ("good") cholesterol to help keep your arteries free of plaque and functioning at their best. The high fat and fiber content of avocados also makes them a super-slow-digesting food. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261631/everything-bagel-avocado-toast/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avocado toast&lt;/a&gt; is delicious, but there are many other ways to enjoy all that this creamy fruit has to offer. Add mashed avocado to a sandwich in place of mayo, or add cubed avocado to a salad for more healthy fats and fiber. Have avocados that are on their way out? Peel, pit and cube them and throw them in the freezer in a zip-top bag. Add a couple of frozen avocado cubes to smoothies for healthy fat, fiber and tons of creaminess.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is a super-important nutrient to include in any eating pattern, especially if you have diabetes. But remember, increasing your fiber intake should be a slow and steady endeavor, as eating too much fiber right off the bat can lead to some unpleasant digestive symptoms. Upping your fiber intake can be as simple as a few additions of high-fiber foods like these throughout your day.

&lt;p class="block"&gt;But a growing number of patients claim Ozempic can come with a terrifying side effect: Irreversible vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Edward Fanelli, a former contractor from Freehold, New Jersey, said he was prescribed Ozempic to manage his diabetes, but within months, his vision went dark - forcing him to give up his career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"Not even six to eight months later, I, out of nowhere, I could not see out of my right eye," he says. "I couldn't take a chance do the contracting work, worried about cutting my fingers off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Fanelli says he was diagnosed with non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), a sudden on-set condition with no cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He is the first patient in New Jersey to file a lawsuit in state court against the makers of Ozempic, claiming he was never warned the blockbuster drug could lead to irreversible vision loss.

	"If they would have told me a chance I could lose my vision, I would not have taken it. Don't care - weight loss would have done on my own," he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;He’s not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long Island-based attorney Jason Goldstein, of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourlawyer.com/"&gt;Parker Waichman LLP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, represents more than a dozen clients, including Fanelli, in lawsuits that center on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the active ingredient in Ozempic and similar drugs, which has now been linked in medical literature to NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein claims the drugmakers failed to warn patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"That's the crux of this case, people are not warned about this. What did the doctor know? What did the patient know? No one knew," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Goldstein says he will be pushing for updated warning labels and compensation so future patients don't find themselves negatively impacted by a drug they thought would help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Novo Nordisk spokesperson released the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"NAION is a very rare eye disease, and it is not an adverse drug reaction for the marketed formulations of semaglutide (Ozempic®, Rybelsus® and Wegovy®) as per the approved labels. After a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and Novo Nordisk’s internal safety assessment, Novo Nordisk is of the opinion that the benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Novo Nordisk, on its part, has conducted an analysis across randomized controlled clinical trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists, including a blinded ophthalmologist evaluation to confirm NAION diagnoses. These data do not suggest a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use and NAION events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Patient safety is a top priority for Novo Nordisk, and we take all reports about adverse events from use of our medicines very seriously. This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes. Any decision to start treatment with prescription-only medicines should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who should do a benefit-risk evaluation for the patient in question, weighing up the benefits of treatment with the potential risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - Long Island</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 23:37:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNN0pCNHBkYkF6dDlyaWNGMTdOTmg4MFoxZDBMMGktcFBpZ1hac1d3YlFfZnVCbW1qd3Zqcjc3MU1HMXFsU2FpdlNHaS1jN3pFNUNIVWFrQVc4bFE4SlJpZG5ULUFmdElMbU1OUEZvZURMNHBDeEJVY0F5NGkyVlVVT2NOVVBWMmxkbkM2b1BxOWlBNnM1NzEzVml0ZjZxUHViT29DZkpUOWMxVENIVmc</guid></item><item><title>6-6-6步行挑战帮助您步入正轨，并可能提高卡路里燃烧- Everygirl | The 6-6-6 Walking Challenge Helps You Get Your Steps In And May Boost Calorie Burn - The Everygirl</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXkFVX3lxTE81X1BEbTRGU2dPOGtYak5JbDlBVktpTVBlYkJZR2ZiYlBaX2pOSDkyLUduQjZ0ZVNDMWg3OUtBaUhZVndzcGR3Q1dtajRCdzZkLUN2M0N6bnV5WXg2YXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry-content cf"&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;You know you need to get &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/walking-10000-steps-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt; (your Fitbit won’t let you forget), and you know that Hot Girl Walks are not just a way to romanticize your summer but a powerful workout &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10643563/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for your mind and body&lt;/a&gt;. But with many of us at desk jobs from 9 to 5 (on a good day) and a limitless Netflix queue, actually getting in those steps can be difficult. But the latest walking trend has a solution. The 6-6-6 Walking Challenge is a daily routine that creates enough structure to reap those benefits but enough flexibility to make sure you can actually follow through, even on busy days. The guidelines are incredibly simple, but experts say the intentionality that makes the 6-6-6 Challenge different than &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/12-3-30-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;other forms of walking&lt;/a&gt; can help increase calorie burn and the effectiveness of the walk itself. So, of course, I had to find out more. Keep reading for the breakdown of the 6-6-6 Walking Challenge and how it can help you step up your daily (step) count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Dustin is an NASM corrective exercise specialist and certified Precision Nutrition coach at &lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Garage Gym Reviews&lt;/a&gt;, with 13 years of experience in the fitness industry.

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-the-6-6-6-walking-trend"&gt;&lt;span id="What_is_the_6-6-6_Walking_Trend"&gt;What is the 6-6-6 Walking Trend?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The 6-6-6 walking workout is a trending routine that involves walking for 60 minutes a day, either at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m., with a 6-minute warm-up and 6-minute cool-down built in,” explained Matt Dustin, an NASM corrective exercise specialist and certified Precision Nutrition coach at &lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Garage Gym Reviews&lt;/a&gt;. “The idea is to make walking part of your daily rhythm while giving your body time to ease into and out of the effort.” During a brisk, 60-minute walk, you can log &lt;a href="https://www.womansworld.com/weight-loss/6-6-6-walking-challenge-can-speed-weight-loss-results-how-to-start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around 5,500 steps&lt;/a&gt;, getting you more than halfway to the gold-standard goal of &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/walking-10000-steps-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether on a walking pad, your favorite hiking trail, or your go-to neighborhood loop, there are no rules or guidelines on how you carry out the workout other than the time of day and a timed warm-up and cool-down. While 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. may sound too early or late—depending on whether you’re a night owl or an early bird—the time options are intended to lower the chances of procrastination and allow you to fit it around your busy schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the warm-up and cool-down, Dustin recommends not overthinking it. To loosen up your body, mobility exercises like arm circles and leg swings (stand sideways next to a wall, holding onto it for balance with your hand closest to it, and swing the opposite leg forward and back like a pendulum) will do the trick, while the cool-down can look like &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/how-to-stretch-after-exercising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-workout stretches&lt;/a&gt; to help your hamstring, calf, and quad muscles recover. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-are-its-health-benefits"&gt;&lt;span id="What_Are_Its_Health_Benefits"&gt;What Are Its Health Benefits?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking can do no wrong, no matter how you do it—it’s proven to be an effective form of exercise with &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/walking-10000-steps-a-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tons of benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But Dustin stands behind the 6-6-6 walking workout as a better way to go about your strolls since it’s more intentional and structured. “A 60-minute daily walk at a consistent time helps form a habit, and [the 6-6-6] includes components like a warm-up and cool-down, which reduce stiffness, help prevent injury, and promote recovery, that people often skip. The time commitment also provides a stronger cardiovascular and mental health benefit than shorter, sporadic walks.” By moving at a steady pace for a full hour, you build endurance and leg strength gradually and safely without much risk of overdoing it, and you can lower your resting heart rate and blood pressure over time. And if you do the 6-6-6 walk consistently, consider weight management (by increasing daily calorie burn without high impact on the joints) a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-it-better-to-do-the-6-6-6-walking-workout-at-6-a-m-or-6-p-m"&gt;&lt;span id="Is_it_better_to_do_the_6-6-6_walking_workout_at_6_am_or_6_pm"&gt;Is it better to do the 6-6-6 walking workout at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m.?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for the ongoing debate over &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/is-it-better-to-exercise-at-night-or-morning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whether it’s better to work out in the morning or evening&lt;/a&gt;, Dustin said when it comes to doing the 6-6-6 walking workout, both arguments have valid points going for them. “Walking at a set time, especially early in the morning or the evening, helps regulate your circadian rhythm. Morning walks expose you to natural light, which can support better sleep at night, while evening walks help lower stress from the day.” Since both morning and evening workouts have pros and cons, the short answer is &lt;em&gt;whenever you can&lt;/em&gt;, depending on your routine, lifestyle, and how your body responds. The key is to align your walking routine with your physical needs and daily schedule. If you struggle with sleep or like to feel more productive during the day, doing the 6-6-6 at 6 a.m. is probably the best choice. However, if you don’t feel motivated in the morning or need to unwind after the workday, you’ll likely get more out of it at 6 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-verdict"&gt;&lt;span id="The_Verdict"&gt;The Verdict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to build consistency and give your physical and mental health a reliable pick-me-up without needing equipment or a gym, the 6-6-6 workout checks out. “Walking is one of the most sustainable forms of exercise, and this version helps you structure it into your daily life in a simple but effective way,” Dustin said. That said, since the &lt;a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity along with a minimum of two days of muscle-strengthening exercises every week, it’s best to incorporate some &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/weight-lifting-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weight lifting&lt;/a&gt; two to three times per week to round out the 6-6-6 routine. Better yet, make it a habit stack and try &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/bala-bangles-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;weighted walks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a full 60 minutes to commit, break it up however you can (think: two 30-minute walks or six 10-minute strides). As with any workout, for the 6-6-6 challenge to be worthwhile, it has to be realistic, consistent, and sustainable for you. The moment it becomes a stressor rather than something that fills your cup, you’ve lost the purpose, and you’re not going to maintain it long-term. 6-6-6 walking challenge or not, prioritize joy and put your best foot forward.&lt;/p&gt;

And people who fall ill with norovirus are contagious from the time they start feeling ill to a few days after they recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus is easily spread through direct contact with infected people, touching contaminated surfaces or eating food prepared by someone who is infected. Symptoms can develop within 12 to 48 hours of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;            &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/z6c0oi/picture297718168/alternates/FREE_1140/1192ea8a-2c85-4c46-84a6-2ee878c12a96" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bond hearing for a &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/tag/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; man accused of &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/crime/man-knowingly-gave-aids-to-cancer-survivor-wife-who-died-2-days-after-she-was-diagnosed-and-he-may-have-infected-other-women-prosecutors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;intentionally giving women the AIDS virus&lt;/a&gt;, including his late wife, got testy at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Brodie, who is in his early 60s, sat at the defense table with his attorney on Monday as he waited to hear if he would face a higher bond amount. The state argued that bond should be denied for Brodie, and they brought several members of the family of his wife, Denise Brodie — who died two days after she was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/crazy/man-admits-to-getting-hiv-just-so-he-could-spread-it-to-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AIDS&lt;/a&gt; that her family believed was given to her by Cleveland Brodie — to give statements in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense attorney had several objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/email-newsletter/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love true crime? Sign up for our newsletter, The Law&amp;amp;Crime Docket, to get the latest real-life crime stories delivered right to your inbox.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local Fox affiliate WAGA was &lt;a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/bond-granted-man-accused-killing-wife-giving-her-aids" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in the courtroom&lt;/a&gt; to capture the hearing where the state argued that Cleveland Brodie was a danger to the community. They wanted bond to be denied and had Denise Brodie’s daughter, Tammy Hammonds, deliver a statement in which she said that she and her family were “gravely concerned for the public’s safety.” She also accused Cleveland Brodie of exhibiting “reckless disregard for the health and safety of others by knowingly living with and allegedly exposing others to HIV without disclosure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense attorney objected, saying that the indictment brought against his client was not evidence. The judge allowed the statement to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next to speak at the hearing was a victim-witness advocate from the Rockdale County District Attorney’s Office, who read a statement from one of Cleveland Brodie’s alleged victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the defense attorney objected, saying that evidence had to come from the actual witness or else whatever the advocate said was just hearsay. It was explained by the prosecutor that the witness, an alleged victim named in the indictment, did not want to speak publicly. Again, the judge allowed the statement to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Denise Brodie’s brother, Jimmie Suber, took the stand and stated that Cleveland Brodie was “a danger to women.” Cleveland Brodie’s defense attorney objected, saying, “He does not know that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several times, Cleveland Brodie’s defense attorney claimed that Denise Brodie did not die of AIDS, but of different health complications. The state argued that those complications were due to AIDS, which Denise Brodie was diagnosed with two days before she died. On the stand, Suber told the defense attorney, “She died of AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Suber concluded his statement requesting that Cleveland Brodie be denied bond, the defense attorney piped up and said, “I have some questions.” Suber responded, “I have answers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was an argument about how Cleveland Brodie was allegedly not just careless about his HIV, he was also allegedly careless about other infectious viruses and would reportedly not wear a mask to protect his cancer-surviving wife from COVID-19. As the argument devolved, the defense attorney asked Suber, “Do you know if they had sex?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suber responded that yes, he knew, to which the defense attorney responded by asking, “You were there when they had sex?” Suber responded that Cleveland Brodie once told him that he and Denise Brodie had not had sex for over a year. He added, “They'[d] been married for how many years, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge then stopped the heated exchange to deliver her decision — she raised Cleveland Brodie’s bond to $800,000, ordered him to continue taking prescribed HIV medication and disallowed him from having any sexual relationships while awaiting trial.&lt;/p&gt;

In mice with a mutated &lt;em&gt;NLRP3&lt;/em&gt; gene, inflammation activated microglia to release IL-1β, overstimulating NMDA glutamate receptors responsible for excitatory brain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overactivation triggered anxiety and meaningless repetitive actions. Administering memantine or interleukin-1RA, both FDA-approved drugs, normalized brain activity and stopped the behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Chronic brain inflammation from &lt;em&gt;NLRP3&lt;/em&gt; mutation causes repetitive behaviors via NMDA receptor overactivation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Repurposing:&lt;/strong&gt; FDA-approved drugs memantine and interleukin-1RA reversed these effects in mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cytokine Cascade:&lt;/strong&gt; IL-1β released by microglia plays a key role in triggering behavioral symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DGIST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitive behaviors, such as repeatedly checking whether doors are locked or washing one’s hands multiple times, may be experienced by anyone at least once and may result in ASD or OCD if the behaviors are severe. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although neural circuit abnormalities and genetic factors have been regarded among the potential causes of repetitive behaviors, no direct association between brain inflammation and these behaviors was identified until Professor Um’s research team suggested that brain inflammation may play a critical role in repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110143"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person and neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-behavior-OCD-ASD-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also found clues about how brain inflammation stimulates NMDA glutamate receptors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved mice with a mutated NLRP3 gene. This gene mutation stimulates a chronic inflammatory response by immune cells in the brain that are called microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prolonged inflammation over-activates N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors, which are important for excitatory neurotransmission. The consequences are meaningless repetitive behaviors and anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having noted that over-activate NMDA glutamate receptors cause repetitive behaviors, the research team administered a drug called memantine, a commercially available treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, to the mice with the NLRP3 gene mutation and found that the drug significantly reduced meaningless repetitive behaviors and that NMDA glutamate activity returned to normalcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that over-active NMDA glutamate receptors directly cause repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found clues about how brain inflammation stimulates NMDA glutamate receptors. They have revealed that inflamed microglia release a pro-inflammatory substance (cytokine) called interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), which affects NMDA glutamate receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice were injected with a drug that blocks the activity of interleukin-1 receptors (interleukin-1RA), it suppressed overactivity in the NMDA glutamate receptors, and the repetitive behaviors disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memantine and interleukin-1RA (product name: Anakinra), which were used in the study, are treatments that are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are currently used to manage Alzheimer’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These readily available drugs of proven safety and efficacy can be repurposed to treat ASD and OCD, negating the need to develop new drugs. As a strategy, drug repurposing reduces drug discovery time and costs, helping to commercialize treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Jiwon Um said, “This study has demonstrated that chronic brain inflammation induces overactivity in NMDA glutamate receptors, resulting in repetitive behavioral disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We may be able to suggest a new therapeutic approach for treating ASD and OCD, which are often accompanied by repetitive behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hyeji Jung of the Department of Brain Sciences within the DGIST was the first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research findings were published online on May 7, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, a scientific journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Information Communication Technology and the National Research Foundation of Korea as part of the Basic Research Center Support Project and the Mid-Career Researcher Support Project.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this inflammation, ASD, and OCD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3f7a6b5a6b1b283a7a4aab0b7eda2a0eda8b1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wankyu Lim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dgist.ac.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DGIST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Wankyu Lim – DGIST&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia regulates repetitive behavior by modulating NMDA glutamate receptor functions&lt;/a&gt;” by Jiwon Um et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia regulates repetitive behavior by modulating NMDA glutamate receptor functions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is a well-established risk factor for various neurological disorders and cognitive decline. However, the precise molecular mechanisms linking inflammation with neuropsychiatric symptoms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, using NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3) conditional knockin (cKI) mice harboring a D301N point mutation originating in patients with autoinflammatory diseases, we found that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by administration of lipopolysaccharide induced anxiety-like and repetitive behaviors frequently found in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as increasing NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor)-mediated excitatory synaptic functions in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, interleukin 1β (IL-1β), a downstream cytokine of the NLRP3 inflammasome, enhanced NMDAR activation and increased surface levels of the selective NMDAR subunit GluN2A in cultured cortical neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, treatment with an NMDAR antagonist or IL-1 receptor antagonist completely normalized the specific behavioral deficits in &lt;em&gt;Nlrp3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;D301N&lt;/sup&gt;-cKI mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectively, our results demonstrate that NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation elicits repetitive behavior through impaired NMDAR functions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 21:04:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5PWTZUb3ptSzJUM0hKbG5pMzhIYnVXbW4wQTJ5MUxGTVkzbmY5MHY4a016MHcxMnd3Z3lnMFNGam02amJxZUZGV3ZFalRTeUhCN3hXV2hSZlR5TGZRa1lydVhDM2FlWFRyekI4UFdfaWlaSDQ</guid></item><item><title>干燥综合征患者罹患非霍奇金淋巴瘤的风险较高：研究-干燥综合征新闻 | Sjögren’s patients have higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma: Study - Sjogren's Syndrome News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQdVY3eW5QZm9NYjJ2eDAzYi1VWC1TVlpGOW1lRWVEckREVGFnUUxoSFE3ZVYxZ3lBN0ktemdYLUdmRklXd0szQjJmZmM4NXllQVBfbUY3OW1GSDl0Q2J5S2tLak5lNXJtSFNGenFzQk9BUk1aNklBLUJydGRfbXQ0bE11XzdfdWFkcGV3djlLTG1IcEdRRFhsTFJfcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/what-is-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s disease&lt;/a&gt; are at higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a type of blood cancer, as well as other malignancies, a study reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers also identified several risk factors associated with &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/news/analysis-finds-increased-risk-cancer-sjogrens-syndrome-patients/"&gt;cancer development&lt;/a&gt; in Sjögren’s patients, noting that nearly a quarter of deaths seen among these patients could be attributed to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the need for early identification of high-risk patients and the refinement of risk prediction models,” researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049017225001143"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cancer risk in Sjögren’s Disease: A longitudinal cohort study on incidence, predictors, and mortality impact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Link between Sjögren’s, solid tumors investigated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sjögren’s is a chronic autoimmune disorder marked by dry eyes and mouth, among &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown Sjögren’s is linked to an increased risk of NHL. However, research remains split on whether other types of cancer, particularly solid tumors, are more likely to arise in people with Sjögren’s than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate this link, researchers examined data from 314 people &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/diagnosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;diagnosed with Sjögren’s&lt;/a&gt; who were receiving care at one of several clinics in Spain. Most (94.6%) were female, and were diagnosed at a median age of 49.9 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a median of 9.5 years of follow-up, 7% of patients developed cancer. Of these, half developed blood cancer, specifically NHL. The other half had solid malignancies, with breast cancer being the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with people in Spain of similar age and sex, patients with Sjögren’s had a 68% higher chance of developing cancer. That risk was even higher for blood cancers, with Sjögren’s patients being 3.55 times more likely to develop such cancers than people from the general population. For solid tumors, the risk was 1.54 times higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“NHL alone accounted for the most of the excess cancer risk, underscoring its central role in [Sjögren’s disease]-associated malignancy,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using statistical analyses, the researchers identified a series of risk factors associated with cancer development in Sjögren’s patients. Malignancy predictors included lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), cryoglobulinemia (a condition where abnormal proteins clump in the blood), and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). Older age and smoking were identified as independent risk factors for cancer development as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;NHL alone accounted for the most of the excess cancer risk, underscoring its central role in [Sjögren’s disease]-associated malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team also found a prior history of cancer in Sjögren’s patients significantly increased the risk of blood cancer development over that of a solid malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses showed significantly more participants with blood cancers used antimalarials, a class of medications that can also help manage Sjögren’s symptoms, than participants with solid tumors. Patients with blood cancers also had higher levels of beta-2 microglobulin, a small protein that can be used as a tumor marker, compared with those with solid malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the follow-up period, cancer accounted for 23.8% of deaths among study participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings underscore the substantial impact of malignancy on overall mortality, revealing that cancer-related deaths account for a significant proportion of excess mortality in [Sjögren’s disease] patients,” the researchers wrote. “These results reinforce the need for tailored malignancy screening strategies …, particularly for high-risk patients with identified predictors such as lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and cryoglobulinemia.”&lt;/p&gt;

People with high levels of neuroticism—a trait linked to emotional instability—were much more likely to experience sleep disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, individuals scoring higher in openness showed lower levels of insomnia, suggesting a protective effect. Anxiety was found to be the key mechanism mediating the relationship between neuroticism and insomnia, while depression was not a significant factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroticism Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; 61.7% of insomniacs had high neuroticism vs. 32% of non-insomniacs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Trait:&lt;/strong&gt; Openness to experience was linked with lower insomnia rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Anxiety fully mediates the relationship between neuroticism and insomnia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study conducted at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of São Paulo (USP) in Brazil examined the influence of personality traits on the development and perpetuation of insomnia and found that there is a direct relationship between the two. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two findings caught the researchers’ attention: high levels of openness were associated with low levels of insomnia, while high levels of neuroticism (characterized by emotional instability) were very common in people with the sleep disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decided to study the influence of personality traits on insomnia because it’s an extremely common disorder that has negative health consequences, such as an increased risk of hypertension, diabetes, anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These different physical and mental health conditions lead to a poorer quality of life in general,” explains Bárbara Araújo Conway, sleep psychologist and author of the master’s dissertation defended at the Institute of Psychiatry of FM-USP, with the support of FAPESP and under the supervision of Professor Renatha El Rafihi-Ferreira, of the Department of Clinical Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the authors explain, insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders in adults. It is estimated that around 30% of the world’s population suffers from the problem, which is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or returning to sleep after an unwanted awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, specifically in the city of São Paulo, this figure is even higher: almost half of the population (45%) suffers from insomnia, according to data from the Epidemiological Sleep Study (EPISONO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five personality traits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Conway, there is a well-established theory in the literature that proposes the existence of the “3 Ps” of insomnia: predisposition (factors that make an individual more likely to have the disorder), precipitation (triggers associated with the onset of symptoms) and perpetuation (behaviors that cause the person to remain in the vicious cycle of insomnia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the researchers hypothesized that neuroticism, which is more prevalent in insomniacs, could be considered a predisposing factor for sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined whether symptoms of anxiety and depression might act as mediators and moderators of the association between neuroticism and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to understand how the authors arrived at the results of the study, we need to take a step back and learn about personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are characteristics that estimate a pattern of what a particular person’s feelings, thoughts and behaviors are like. They’re a set of factors that make up an individual’s personality and characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to the Big Five theory, we all have different levels of the five personality traits,” the psychologist explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Extroversion:&lt;/strong&gt; People with higher levels of extroversion tend to be more talkative, more dominant, with a leadership profile. They prefer group activities, find it easier to relate and create intimacy and tend to be more assertive. People with low levels of extroversion, on the other hand, are not necessarily introverts, but they prefer to be more alone and tend to find it more difficult to work in groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Neuroticism: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a personality trait related to the degree of emotional stability. People with high levels of neuroticism tend to be more emotionally unstable and focus on the more negative aspects of life. They are people who, when faced with adversity, tend to become disorganized, suffer more intensely, and are more susceptible to stress. Scientific literature shows that high neuroticism correlates with anxiety and depression.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Agreeableness: &lt;/strong&gt;This is a personality trait related to empathy. People with high levels of agreeableness tend to be more empathetic, more cordial and concerned about the well-being of others, focusing a lot on the other person’s situation (they may even be naive and value the other person to the detriment of themselves). Those with low scores tend to be more skeptical and suspicious.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Openness to experience: &lt;/strong&gt;People who are open to new experiences tend to be more creative, with exploratory behavior in the face of novelty. They are curious, imaginative and experience emotions more intensely. People with low levels of openness are those who prefer routine, avoid discomfort and tend to be conventional.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 –&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Conscientiousness:&lt;/strong&gt; This can also be called achievement. People with high levels are determined, committed, motivated, persevering and can sacrifice momentary pleasures in pursuit of a greater goal. A very high index may not be good because it can lead to perfectionism. Those with low scores are less demanding, less stubborn, and would be considered “lazy” in the common sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To arrive at the results, the researchers studied 595 participants between the ages of 18 and 59, divided into two groups: one made up of insomniacs who had sought help and received a formal diagnosis from a sleep specialist, and the other half was a control group of people who had no complaints of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant’s personality levels were determined using a 60-question, score-based questionnaire used exclusively by psychology professionals. Volunteers from both groups answered the questions, allowing the researchers to determine the scores for each person’s personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying the questionnaire to the two groups, cross-checking and analyzing the data, Conway found that the insomnia patients had much higher scores for neuroticism than the non-insomnia subjects, as well as lower scores for agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extroversion was the only personality trait that did not show a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Neuroticism was the trait that stood out the most, with insomniacs having a much higher rate. But we can’t say that insomniacs are more introverted,” Conway ponders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyses also showed that: 61.7% of the insomniacs had high levels of neuroticism compared to 32% of the control group; 40.7% of the insomniacs had low levels of openness compared to 23% of the healthy group; 31.5% of the subjects with insomnia had low levels of agreeableness compared to 23.2% of the non-insomniacs; and 37.7% of the insomniacs had low levels of conscientiousness compared to 24.1% of the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After more detailed statistical analysis, the results of the study allow us to assert that people with high levels of neuroticism are more likely to have insomnia,” says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also carried out a statistical analysis to see if any other factor might be confounding the association between neuroticism and insomnia, and discovered that anxiety acts as a mediating mechanism, meaning that it is the symptoms of anxiety that actually cause neuroticism to influence the development of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It explains the whole effect of high neuroticism on insomnia,” says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also tested the role of depression, but it did not prove to be an important mechanism in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect on practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering that personality traits are associated with positive or negative physical and mental health outcomes, the study suggests that it is important to know the most prevalent personality traits among individuals with insomnia so that this knowledge can help in the process of assessment, prevention and planning of more appropriate treatments according to the specific characteristics of each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results confirm that in order to treat a patient’s insomnia, it is also necessary to assess and treat their anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are important in clinical practice because when receiving patients with this personality trait, it’s essential to think about a treatment plan that focuses not only on sleep but also on anxiety,” says El Rafihi-Ferreira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for this to happen, healthcare professionals need to understand and assess the personalities of patients who seek help for sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that most insomniacs are highly neurotic. These patients deserve to have their anxiety assessed and treated so that their insomnia also improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes this involves different therapies and medications, so it’s important to take a broader look at each individual’s history and specifics,” Conway emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the treatment considered the “gold standard” for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), but there are still too few psychologists specializing in sleep in Brazil to offer it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the researchers advocate that health professionals take a broader view and delve deeper into the study of patients’ psychological factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The association between personality traits, anxiety and insomnia makes it important to develop transdiagnostic treatment protocols, i.e. those that involve the integration of behavioral techniques and processes to treat a range of emotional difficulties that share processes and mechanisms underlying the different complaints,” says the study’s supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already have a non-pharmacological treatment for insomnia, but just as we don’t have a drug that will be effective for all patients, a single therapy approach may not work for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results contribute to the development of new, more personalized psychological and behavioral protocols for the treatment of insomnia,” Conway concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this insomnia and personality traits research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ee6fcebe7e0ebfcfacee8effeebfdfea0ecfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jsr.70003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Personality traits and insomnia: direct and anxiety-mediated associations&lt;/a&gt;” by Bárbara Araújo Conway et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality traits and insomnia: direct and anxiety-mediated associations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia is the one of the most prevalent sleep disorders in the adult population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that personality traits, particularly neuroticism, act as factors that predispose to and potentially perpetuate insomnia; however, there is still no consensus in the literature regarding these relationships considering their mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 595 participants answered the Insomnia Severity Index, Revised Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness (NEO) Five-Factor Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, questions of the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/em&gt; (fifth edition), and a sociodemographic questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descriptive analysis, correlations and stepwise linear regression were used to assess the associations between the five personality traits and insomnia severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation and moderation analyses were performed to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a direct negative association between insomnia severity and openness to experience and an indirect positive association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety was identified as a mediator and depression as a moderator of the association between insomnia severity and neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuroticism and openness to experience personality traits are significant predictors of insomnia severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Openness to experience appears to be a protective factor against insomnia. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results may contribute to the development of new psychological and behavioural protocols for the treatment of insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 20:27:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9zbzVzTTQ1NkN1X2xZS01XZjNBdnpBYzJGeURqU3VkVGdldDIwUUhVTjF6MlV5MTJZUVcyTFFYSmg4djhLOGhDbUtYb08zR3ZWaV93QTIzTzRjSG1zaUZWR0xUWEM1eVlwbnBLUkpGMVdoQWpTbnNv</guid></item><item><title>布莱恩·约翰逊（ Bryan Johnson ）、梅尔·吉布森（ Mel Gibson- ） ，可能还有小RFK （ RFK Jr. ）穿着亚甲蓝以下是科学所说的-财富 | Bryan Johnson, Mel Gibson—and possibly RFK Jr.—swear by methylene blue for wellness.

&lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Health officials reported that there were six cases of measles in 2024.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 data-v-d11d7278&gt;What is measles?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p original-article-post="" data-v-ec26887a data-v-d11d7278&gt;Dig deeper:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the virus can linger in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours after the infected individual has left the area. Symptoms typically appear between seven and 14 days after exposure and often begin with a high fever, cough, runny nose, and watery eyes. A rash of small, red spots usually follows, starting at the head and spreading across the body. Health experts emphasize that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine remains the most effective defense against infection. The CDC recommends children receive the first dose of the MMR vaccine between 12 and 15 months of age, followed by a second dose between 4 and 6 years old. A single dose of the vaccine provides immunity to over 95% of recipients, while the second dose increases protection to about 98%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-v-d11d7278&gt;Anyone experiencing symptoms consistent with measles should contact their healthcare provider immediately. However, officials strongly advise calling ahead before visiting a doctor’s office, hospital, or public health clinic to reduce the risk of exposing others. Healthcare providers who suspect a case of measles are urged to notify public health authorities right away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div original-article-post="" class="group-source-title" data-v-4fbf7207 data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;p class="group-source-paragraph" data-v-4fbf7207&gt;&lt;b data-v-4fbf7207&gt;The Source:&lt;/b&gt; The details in this article were provided by the Georgia Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;     &lt;p data-uid="fts-ar-17" class="vendor-unit" data-v-d11d7278&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>FOX 5 Atlanta</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 20:01:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPZUhBRjktN29VZXdVUmd2TkotVEc0Sm9ldWljREZqS1RpNkhldzVGUDNvUGo2SEphTms4Q0VvWEtlRC14MkFhVXpaOHNMOVg5VkJ6TFNPRjA2OFh3ekp4aUFJVGdGQ0c0Vm90SWZyZVB1dk9WX3VMdlVLU2hfUzBkUkczT2lpakJuaUlZ0gGQAUFVX3lxTE5rSTlxWWFwYTg5ZFc0clgyTzlwQ2lmRlcxV1VSVWh6Y243QlViVGJvXzVfbzFFeVBqVU1PNkZ5aXFNVWFsRUhFcldlOU5heHYwaVIzekxaM1ZQbl9vSk9FenQtNk1HTE5IcEdzaFptNm5RVnVuUnczQmlOZWUtX1BnakJoVlZmRWZUbS1JRWRibA</guid></item><item><title>《纽约时报》为何男性高于女性提供了遗传线索 | A Genetic Clue to Why Men Are Taller Than Women - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE14Y2M1eGtaNEk2RUNrd2RYcW1fSHlZbDU4S3BPQW9DRTd1NmhuUGFTRElDWDh1eXhWYUxpcUNjOTVYcm1GSDQ5ZTBHQWZEUGRmSDR6RjItNDRPNHhIRTV3WVNRN1FBS2pnajRQdWhNVDdsVlNhSUdodg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Men are taller than women, by an average of about five inches.

SHOX is present on both the X chromosome — females have two X chromosomes — and the Y chromosome; males have one X and one Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The researchers suspected that SHOX might explain differences in male and female height, but there was a problem with that hypothesis.

Whether you hopped on the bandwagon and began drinking &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/personal-care/can-prebiotic-soda-hurt-your-teeth-heres-what-experts-say/" target="_self"&gt;prebiotic or probiotic beverages&lt;/a&gt;, many people have become obsessed with healing their gut to avoid embarrassing symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/we-all-bloat-but-heres-how-to-know-if-its-a-problem/" target="_self"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt; and/or flatulence. In fact, the trillions of microbes living in your gut, collectively known as the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/microbiome/" target="_self"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, serve as your body's internal environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Consider your &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-microbiome#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-microbiome%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22gut%20microbiome%22}" target="_self"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; as "little pets living inside your intestinal tract," Cleveland Clinic microbiome expert Gail Cresci explains. These microbes help break down food, regulate inflammation, support immunity and even produce essential compounds like vitamins and hormones. This is why it's vital to understand your body's warning signs and be able to identify when something is not quite right. So to answer the big question of how to keep your gut healthy, read on for a couple of health hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/experts-share-what-your-bowel-movements-say-about-your-health/" target="_self"&gt; Are Your Poops Regular? Experts Share What Your Bowel Movements Mean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're bloated or you have lots of gas, you may have a disrupted composition and function of the gut microbiome," Cresci said, adding that the only way to know for sure is to have it &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/microbiome-testing" target="_self"&gt;measured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs of an unhealthy gut may include vomiting or stomach upset, fatigue, trouble sleeping, food intolerance &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gut-health#improving-gut-health" target="_self"&gt;and other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Skin irritation or problems may be one particularly visible sign, as some research &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048199/" target="_self"&gt;links skin issues like acne and psoriasis&lt;/a&gt; to the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into how it &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2022/2/hoac015/6553029" target="_self"&gt;impacts reproductive health&lt;/a&gt; and hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/the-abcs-of-apple-cider-vinegar-benefits-precautions-and-proper-dosage/" target="_self"&gt;The ABCs of Apple Cider Vinegar: Benefits, Precautions and Proper Dosage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Carol Yepes/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to help your gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to see a doctor to get to the root cause of your health concern and rule out other conditions. Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut, and your overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome, Cresci said, since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods to remove from your gut, or eat in lower amounts, include foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-heart-healthy-foods-to-add-to-your-grocery-list-this-week/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Make note of the medications you're taking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/" target="_self"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf" target="_self"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the PH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/news/7-best-probiotics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has their own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking it for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/10-workouts-youre-probably-already-doing-every-day/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to information from the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_self"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too.

But even 'health' foods contain them - such as low fat yoghurts and protein products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gastroenterologist at the University of Miami Dr Maria Abreu believes a contributing factor to the rise of colon cancer is a change in the body's microbiome, which could be caused by the amount of emulsifiers in modern foods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration deems emulsifiers as 'generally recognized as safe' which means they are safe to consume when used as as additive but doctors have begun to warn of the dangers it can have on gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7596189/Cases-pancreatic-colorectal-cancer-soared-10-world-1990.html" class=""&gt;expected to die from colorectal cancer this year&lt;/a&gt;, while about 150,000 are expected to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes 2,600 people under 50 years old, with experts concerned over rising rates in the age group — with cases expected to double between 2010 and 2030, after having risen two percent a year since the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com reveals six emulsifier-ridden foods that may increase your risk of colon cancer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Protein shakes are usually made by blending either water or milk with a protein powder but it may also contain an emulsifier known as carrageenan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Protein shakes&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doctors warn that many of the pre-made, store-bought versions may contain the emulsifier carrageenan, which is derived from red seaweed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Usually hidden far down the ingredients list, the additive is used to give them a thicker texture and keep the shakes mixed while they spend months on shelves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But several studies have also raised concerns over a potential link between consuming this emulsifier and colon cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists are concerned that carrageenan could be degraded in the stomach, by its high acid levels, and turn into degraded carrageenan — a potentially toxic substance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/11/1780"&gt;2024 review&lt;/a&gt; from the journal Nutrients found that the degraded emulsifier triggered intestinal ulceration and inflammation in animal studies, and that it could also reduce bacterial diversity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/71/Suppl_2/A66.1"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in China suggested that mice exposed to degraded carrageenan were more likely to develop tumors in their colon. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Abreu warned that exposure to the additive could cause inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease, which also raise the risk of suffering from the cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Peanut butter &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Peanut butter comes packed with mono and diglycerides - an animal fat sourced emulsifier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a staple in many households, with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches being a childhood favorite for most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors warn that many peanut butters are packed with the emulsifiers called mono and diglycerides, the most commonly used in food manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Made from animal fats, they are often used in peanut butter to keep the oil and nut spread mixed inside the jar from separating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Abreu previously raised concerns that these could cause colon cancer, pointing to studies suggesting that these emulsifiers could cause gut inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10863884/"&gt;2024 PLOS Medicine &lt;/a&gt;study suggests that consuming these emulsifiers can raise someone's overall risk of suffering from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After tracking 92,000 adults for seven years, the researchers found that those who admitted to consuming more foods containing these additives had an up to 46 percent higher risk of developing breast or prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's not clear why this may be the case, but the researchers suggested that disruption in the gut caused by emulsifiers could cause low-grade inflammation across the body — raising the risk of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Coffee creamer substitutes and nut milks &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may think that opting for almond, soy or oat-based milk or creamers may be better for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors warn that nut milks and creamer substitutes available in grocery stores may contain the emulsifier xanthan gum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Used to mimic the creaminess of dairy milk, the thickener is also used to improve the shelf life of alternative milks that would otherwise go sour in a week's time, as regular whole milk does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some studies have linked xanthan gum to health benefits such as weight loss and lower cholesterol, University of Michigan &lt;span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/study-helps-explain-how-xanthan-gum-common-food-additive-processed-gut"&gt;researchers &lt;/a&gt;found in 2022 that consumption of xanthan gum can lead to an altered gut microbiome — paving the way for the development of colon cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nut milks and creamer substitutes that are available in the supermarket are usually filled with xanthan gum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Matthew Ostrowski, lead author and a former researcher at the University of Michigan Medical School Department explained: 'While xanthan gum is generally considered safe, our results suggest that its widespread consumption may be enriching our microbiomes for bacteria that consume it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'This may be especially important for people who consume above-average amounts of xanthan gum, such as people with celiac disease and those following gluten-free diets.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Shredded cheese &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether it's store-bought shredded gouda, parmesan, sharp cheddar or mozzarella, doctors warn that this could contain the emulsifier carboxymethyl cellulose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as cellulose gum, this emulsifier is used with the cheeses to keep the strands separated, boost their shelf-life and prevent fungal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while this certain emulsifier may seem safer as its derived from plants, certain experts say that it might be linked to increased risk of colon cancer and other gastrointestinal issues such as bloating and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cspinet.org/article/carboxymethyl-cellulose-cmc-cellulose-gum-sodium-carboxymethyl-cellulose-cmc"&gt;2015 &lt;/a&gt;study funded by the National Institutes of Health found that cellulose gum affected gut bacteria, triggered inflammation and other changes in the gut and promoted colon cancer in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However unlike its counterparts, more research is needed to understand how cellulose gum can increase the risk for cancer in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Certain non fat yogurts contain some type of emulsifier - mostly carrageenan - to give the products their creamy consistency&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Yogurt &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular 'Light and Fit' yogurts, zero-sugar Greek yogurts and 'complete' protein yogurts frequently contain some type of emulsifier - mostly carrageenan - to give the products their creamy consistency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Abreu said previously: 'Something in the microbiome has changed, and it’s setting in motion this chronic inflammation in the [gastrointestinal] tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These ultra-processed foods create a lot of noise in the microbial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Things like emulsifiers that are added in, things that are creamy, you know, the nonfat yogurts and all these things, really can change the gut microbiome very profoundly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Multiple studies have found links between the gut microbiome and colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8777015/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;concluded: 'Because the colorectal region is a site where changes in the gut microbiota can influence the organs directly, [colorectal cancer] CRC is considered to be affected by the gut microbiome more than other tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies of the gut microbiome revealed that [disruption of the microbiome] occurred more frequently in CRC patients than in healthy people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Energy bars &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Energy bars that are meant to give you a boost and pull you out of a tired slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these may actually be packed with emulsifiers, including soy lecithin, mono- and diglycerides and carrageenan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The additives help create a smooth and uniform texture by preventing ingredients like oils and water from separating. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soy lecithin, an additive derived from soybeans, can reduce cholesterol levels, support digestion and is considered to help reduce cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However as evidenced above, mono- and diglycerides as well carrageenan additives continue to pose a cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While generally safe, experts remain concerned about overconsumption of such bars that have little to no nutritional value and their potential impact on the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html" class=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 18:23:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQVk9laURjcnZkbi0walQzaDY2UXBNSkZFQWxpbTZHYWV0WHJYZWc2a3hCMmVmNDNFcmswNjdfTEdoNF9VbGVkMU93akxrbG5HTUE3M0hnU1RFeGtvbjlBcFhBTm0tYjgwMkRidEluUzh4RmQ5MUVtZmZzZVVSZVNPTDdQSEdwek9IY0QycDF1ZWt2blhoeDUzNEhIMHFZTzlKZ0lnQQ</guid></item><item><title>当您每天吃山核桃时，胆固醇会发生什么变化？ - Verywell Health | What Happens to Your Cholesterol When You Eat Pecans Every Day? - Verywell Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1oQ1dfY0xsR3JmNlNmRTdlTmR6U295MEk0UWJ6QjFnRFdjTWJlTERJQzJyMGtRWFVnbjJlaFBjckhDbDNNLTJoLU1MOEwwS0x1ODNDaU0tUHFhcEFUc3pYN2FZUFdYY0RUM0xpTnZfamhLQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering a healthy snack between meals?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study, published in &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, included 138 adults between ages 25 and 70.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The participants were split into two groups: one ate about two ounces of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/pecans-8358277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;raw, unsalted pecans daily&lt;/a&gt;, while the other continued with their usual snacks. All participants underwent medical testing, including cholesterol and blood pressure checks, before and after the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By the end of the trial, blood tests showed that those who ate pecans had &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-that-lower-cholesterol-5189944" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and better overall diet quality compared to the control group.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The findings suggest the benefits weren’t just from eating nuts generally, but specifically from pecans.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Poor diet plays a major role in cardiometabolic diseases, the leading cause of death in the United States, said &lt;a href="https://theresagentilerd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Theresa Gentile, MS, RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nuts, including pecans, are part of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/heart-healthy-diet-11692926" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; and may improve risk factors for these diseases,” Gentile told.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Gentile emphasized that pecans should not replace cholesterol medication. “Lifestyle changes can help improve cholesterol levels and enhance how well medications work, but food doesn’t have the same effect as medication,” she said.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While statins can reduce LDL cholesterol by 20% to 60%, the new study found that pecans reduced total cholesterol by 3.6% and LDL by 6%.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with irregular sleep schedules had a 26% higher risk of major cardiovascular events—including heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure—even if they got the recommended amount of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sleep regularity may matter just as much as sleep duration: going to bed and waking up at consistent times was linked to significantly better heart health outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The study found a clear dose-response relationship, with higher sleep regularity scores tied to lower cardiovascular risk; an SRI score of 77.1 or above was associated with a 15–18% risk reduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTTAWA, Canada — &lt;/strong&gt;Even if you’re getting enough sleep overall, inconsistent bedtimes and wake-up times might be putting your heart at serious risk. An international study shows that people with irregular sleep schedules face a significantly higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure, regardless of whether they clock the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/79/4/257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, followed more than 72,000 adults for nearly eight years and discovered that those with the most chaotic sleep patterns had a 26% higher risk of major cardiovascular events compared to people who maintained regular sleep schedules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also found that getting the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sleep-an-important-antidote-for-depression-and-anxiety-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommended amount of sleep&lt;/a&gt; didn’t protect irregular sleepers from heart problems. For millions of Americans whose work schedules, family responsibilities, or lifestyle habits lead to erratic sleep patterns, this could be a wake-up call about a previously underappreciated heart risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from institutions including the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute and the University of Sydney used data from the UK Biobank, analyzing information from 72,269 adults aged 40-79 who wore wrist accelerometers for a week to precisely measure their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt;. The team calculated each participant’s “Sleep Regularity Index” (SRI), a measure that captures day-to-day consistency in bedtime, wake-up time, sleep duration, and awakenings during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;
&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;More than just sleep duration goes into your sleep health. (Krakenimages.com/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The SRI is scored from 0 (completely random sleep-wake times) to 100 (perfectly consistent sleep patterns). Participants were divided into three groups: those with regular sleep (SRI above 87.3), moderately irregular sleep (SRI between 71.6 and 87.3), and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poor-sleep-gut-harmful-bacteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;irregular sleep&lt;/a&gt; (SRI below 71.6).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After following participants for an average of 7.8 years, researchers documented 4,887 major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE)—a measure that includes &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strokes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;. Even after accounting for numerous factors like age, physical activity, diet, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/smoking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/alcohol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, and existing health conditions, the findings remained accurate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-risks-and-irregular-sleep"&gt;Heart Risks and Irregular Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/irregular-sleep-depression-moods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;irregular sleep patterns&lt;/a&gt; had a 26% higher risk of experiencing a MACE event compared to regular sleepers. Even those with moderately irregular sleep patterns showed an 8% increased risk. This connection was particularly strong for heart failure, with irregular sleepers facing a 45% higher risk compared to consistent sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also looked at the combination of sleep regularity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/better-sleep-green-streets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep duration&lt;/a&gt;. Conventional wisdom might suggest that as long as you’re getting enough sleep, some irregularity wouldn’t matter. This data shows that might not be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with irregular sleep patterns faced an elevated &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/periodontitis-gum-disease-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular risk&lt;/a&gt; even if they slept the recommended 7-9 hours (for adults under 65) or 7-8 hours (for those 65 and older). While sufficient sleep partially offset the risk for moderately irregular sleepers, it didn’t help those with the most erratic patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The relationship between sleep irregularity and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/heart-problems-brain-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular problems&lt;/a&gt; appears to follow a dose-response pattern. This means that the more irregular your sleep, the higher your risk. However, the researchers identified a threshold: an SRI score of at least 77.1 was associated with a 15% reduction in cardiovascular risk, while the median score of 80.8 correlated with an 18% risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-inconsistent-sleep-hurts-your-heart"&gt;Why Inconsistent Sleep Hurts Your Heart&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What explains this connection? When sleep patterns vary widely, it causes circadian misalignment,  essentially throwing off the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/high-fat-diets-body-clock-obesity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body’s internal clock&lt;/a&gt;. This disruption can cascade into various physiological changes that stress the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These disruptions can lead to problems with glucose and lipid metabolism, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/diabetes-insulin-producing-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system, all factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Irregular sleep patterns were more common among certain groups in the study. People who reported &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health issues&lt;/a&gt;, those taking medications for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cholesterol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, and individuals working night shifts were all more likely to have irregular sleep patterns. Current smokers also tended to have less regular sleep compared to non-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recommendations about sleep duration have become common in recent years, with the American Heart Association even adding sleep duration to its “Life’s Essential 8” metrics for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/7-keys-to-sleep-health-heart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, but sleep regularity has received far less attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those looking to improve sleep regularity, experts suggest maintaining a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sleep-schedule-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consistent sleep schedule&lt;/a&gt; (even on weekends), establishing a relaxing bedtime routine, and creating a sleep-conducive environment. How consistently we sleep may be just as important as how long we sleep—and for your heart’s sake, sticking to regular bedtimes might matter more than we previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the UK Biobank, focusing on 72,269 adults aged 40-79 who wore wrist accelerometers for 7 days. They calculated a Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) for each participant using validated algorithms that measure consistency in sleep-wake patterns. Participants were categorized as having irregular sleep (SRI &amp;lt;71.6), moderately irregular sleep (SRI 71.6-87.3), or regular sleep (SRI &amp;gt;87.3). They also classified participants based on whether they met age-specific sleep duration recommendations (7-9 hours for ages 18-64, 7-8 hours for those 65+). Information on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was obtained from hospitalization and death records, with participants followed for an average of 7.8 years. The researchers excluded participants with previous history of MACE or who had an event in the first year of follow-up to reduce reverse causation. They used Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for numerous confounders including age, sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, physical activity, screen time, diet, coffee intake, alcohol consumption, smoking, mental health, medication use, family history, shift work, and self-reported sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that irregular sleepers had a 26% higher risk of MACE (HR 1.26, 95% CI 1.16-1.37) and moderately irregular sleepers had an 8% higher risk (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.70) compared to regular sleepers. When examining MACE subtypes, irregular sleep was associated with a 45% higher risk of heart failure, 23% higher risk of myocardial infarction, and 22% higher risk of stroke. The relationship between SRI and MACE risk was near-linear, with steeper risk reduction at higher SRI scores. An SRI score of at least 77.1 was associated with a 15% reduction in MACE risk. Joint analyses of sleep regularity and duration showed that meeting sleep duration recommendations offset MACE risk for moderately irregular sleepers (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.18), but not for irregular sleepers (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), indicating that adequate sleep duration cannot compensate for highly irregular sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has several limitations. The UK Biobank had a low response rate (5.5%), which may affect representativeness of the broader population. Covariate assessments were conducted at a single time point rather than treated as time-varying factors, with a median lag of 5.5 years between baseline measurements and the accelerometry sub-study. While the study design allows for assessing associations, randomized experiments would be needed for stronger causal inference. Sleep was measured over only a single week, which may not fully capture long-term sleep patterns. The accelerometry method has limitations in distinguishing between quiet wakefulness and sleep, potentially leading to misclassification. Additionally, the SRI algorithm did not detect napping, only the longest sleep period of the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource and funded through Dr. Stamatakis’ Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Investigator Grant. Several authors disclosed potential conflicts of interest: Dr. Cistulli has an endowed Academic Chair at the University of Sydney created from ResMed funding (though he receives no personal fees) and has received research support from ResMed, SomnoMed, and Bayer, and serves as consultant to these companies. Dr. Rajaratnam declared grants from Vanda Pharmaceuticals, WA Police, and the CDC, consulting fees from Roche and Circadian Therapeutics, honoraria from Roche, and holds a patent for a digital application for sleep in shift workers.

&lt;p&gt;“Exercise is an increasingly essential part of a comprehensive Parkinson’s care plan,” Lisa Hoffman, senior director of professional education at the Parkinson’s Foundation, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parkinsons-foundation-expands-roster-of-accredited-exercise-education-providers-302452770.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Providers that receive accreditation have shown clear evidence of aligning their curriculum with our established competencies. We are grateful for their dedication to providing expert-led, [Parkinson’s]-specific training.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dance for PD provides &lt;a href="https://danceforparkinsons.org/take-a-class/in-person-class-options/"&gt;in-person dance classes&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and 30 countries around the world, free &lt;a href="https://danceforparkinsons.org/take-a-class/dance-at-home/"&gt;at-home&lt;/a&gt; interactive Zoom classes, instructional videos, and an extensive digital class library. Classes may be performed sitting or standing, through different dance styles and movement classes, to improve balance and flexibility. The organization also offers classes that combine dance and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re honored to be named a Parkinson’s Foundation Accredited Exercise Education Provider,” said David Leventhal, program director and lead trainer of Dance for PD. “This recognition affirms the rigor of our established, global training program and the value of dance as powerful exercise for people living with Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s Pointe is a nonprofit health promotion and wellness center in the Denver metropolitan area that offers &lt;a href="https://parkinsonspointe.org/classes/"&gt;exercise classes&lt;/a&gt; by certified instructors. Classes may include boxing techniques and strength tools to improve motor coordination, strength, and balance. Indoor bike training, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-health-benefits-of-tai-chi"&gt;tai chi&lt;/a&gt;, and yoga classes are also offered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;What makes an accredited exercise provider?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/resources-support/professionals/special-programs/exercise-accreditation-recognition"&gt;Parkinson’s Foundation Accredited Exercise Education&lt;/a&gt; providers must follow &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/sites/default/files/documents/Criteria-for-Exercise-Education-Programs-and-Courses.pdf"&gt;certain criteria&lt;/a&gt; to educate professionals on the specifics of exercise programs for Parkinson’s by providing information on the disease, including its diagnosis, symptoms, and progression, along with education about different &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/"&gt;treatments&lt;/a&gt;, from medical management to rehabilitation and exercise therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Providers should also educate professionals on the evidence-based benefits of exercise for Parkinson’s and its potential barriers, and how to engage with people with Parkinson’s and their care partners. They should also provide education about health-risk screening and physical assessments to determine the most appropriate exercise plan that considers each patient’s abilities, and its health risks, and feasibility. These plans should follow the Parkinson’s Foundation &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/library/fact-sheets/exercise-recommendations"&gt;exercise guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that address the domains recommended to people with the disease, create a safe environment, monitor for Parkinson’s-specific risk factors, and help motivate patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foundation is inviting Parkinson’s health and exercise professionals and members of the community to provide feedback on these guidelines, which were developed by an international team of experts. Comments can be submitted through July 1 via an &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/resources-support/professionals/resources/exercise-professionals#guidelines"&gt;online form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. We want you to love the meals you’re eating! If there’s a meal you don’t like, definitely feel free to substitute another option. In this meal plan, we aimed for about 1,500 calories, a minimum of 80 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber and a max of 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day, as recommended by the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Check out more of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7952332/high-protein-high-fiber-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein, high-fiber dinner ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day, that works! Each breakfast option is between 338 and 364 calories while each lunch is between 355 and 430 calories. These ranges are fairly close and should be fine to swap out, or find another option entirely if that’s preferred. If you’re closely monitoring your calories, protein, fiber or other nutrients, you may want to be mindful to choose a swap with similar stats or adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What are the health benefits of fiber?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber is a type of indigestible carbohydrate found in whole grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. It has many health benefits and has been tagged as our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053298/best-nutrient-for-weight-loss-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;No. 1 nutrient for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, improved blood sugar levels and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber is probably best known for its role in helping to reduce constipation and regulate bowel movements, but it’s also an important nutrient for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="4"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_161-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein and fiber both help us feel full, which can help with weight loss, but their mechanisms are different. Fiber is broken down slowly, meaning it stays in our digestive tract longer and promotes feelings of fullness. Soluble fiber hangs out in the large intestine, where it ferments and forms short-chain fatty acids that regulate appetite, influence fat storage and reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When protein is digested, satiety hormones that help us feel full are released and the hunger-inducing hormone, ghrelin, is suppressed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Though their mechanisms are different, it’s clear that a routine that provides plenty of protein and fiber is a great tool for weight loss.

      &lt;p&gt;Failure is a big topic in the weight lifting world these days. When you’re doing an exercise, do you need to push each set to the point that you literally can’t complete one more rep? Old-school practical wisdom says yes. More recent &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/lifting-to-failure-study/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that training to failure isn’t necessary, and might actually be counterproductive because it takes such a big toll on both your muscles and your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is probably somewhere in the middle, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40249908/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/i&gt;—but the results lean toward the idea that failure isn’t necessary for most of us. The study finds that getting close to failure produces strength gains that are similar to going all the way. That said, training to failure does build a little more muscle mass at some locations. The results of the study also offer some useful clues for those of us seeking the biggest muscle gains from the least amount of time and effort in the gym—not because we’re lazy, I hasten to add, but because we want to spend that time and effort in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Schoenfeld and his colleagues at City University of New York (CUNY) Lehman College put 42 participants—34 men and 8 women—through an eight-week full-body training program. One group was assigned to complete all their sets to failure while the other was instructed to always stop short of failure. The volunteers were all experienced lifters who had been hitting the gym at least three times a week for more than a year, which means there were no easy gains to be had. And the experimental lifting protocol called for just two workouts a week, with each workout consisting of just one set of nine different exercises. In total, each workout took about half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea of short, single-set workouts isn’t radical or new. Back in the 1970s, Arthur Jones, the inventor of Nautilus exercise machines, &lt;a href="http://arthurjonesexercise.com/Ironman/Colorado.PDF" data-afl-p="0"&gt;popularized&lt;/a&gt; an approach that relied exclusively on single sets to failure. The problem is that pushing to true failure is no joke. It takes a lot of mental focus, and it also takes more time to recover. If your primary interest is another sport like running, you don’t necessarily want your legs to feel like lead the day after a strength workout. So it would be nice if it were possible to get most of the benefits of a hard workout while stopping short of true failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test that theory, the approach Schoenfeld and his colleagues used is called “repetitions in reserve.” The subjects in the non-failure group were instructed to continue each set until they felt they had two repetitions in reserve, meaning that they would be able to squeeze out two more complete reps before failing on the subsequent one. It seems like a much more humane way to train—and it also turned out to be fairly effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most surprising result of the study is that both groups got measurably bigger and stronger even though they were working out less often than they were before the study period. That fits with a bunch of previous research on the “&lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/minimum-strength-training/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;minimum effective dose&lt;/a&gt;” for strength training. It doesn’t mean that half an hour, twice a week is sufficient to &lt;i&gt;maximize&lt;/i&gt; your gains. But it does mean that those of us for whom strength training is mostly a means to some other end (like staying healthy, avoiding injury, or being able to carry a heavy pack) can make progress with a relatively modest investment of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as the efficacy of training to failure goes, there were a whole bunch of different outcomes in the study. The simplest were one-rep max in the bench press and squat, as measures of upper and lower body strength. To test explosive power, the researchers used a countermovement jump (CMJ), which simply involves squatting down then leaping as high as possible in a single motion. To test muscular endurance, they had the subjects complete as many reps as possible (AMRAP) on a leg-extension machine lifting 60 percent of their body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the outcomes looked like for various measures of strength and muscle size in the failure and reps-in-reserve (RIR) groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2704218" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-2704218 " src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-19-at-10.25.27-AM-1024x996.png?width=680" alt="" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-19-at-10.25.27-AM.png?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-19-at-10.25.27-AM.png?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption "&gt;&lt;span class="article__caption"&gt;Strength increases were similar with and without failure, but power increased more when training to failure.&lt;/span&gt; (Illustration: Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four tests of strength (bench press, squat, CMJ, and AMRAP) are at the bottom. The solid vertical line at 0.0 corresponds to no change after eight weeks of training. Both bench press and squat increased, with no significant difference between groups. For example, max squat increased by 13.2 percent on average in the failure group and 12.4 percent in the reps-in-reserve group. Same with muscular endurance (AMRAP). Power (CMJ), on the other hand, increased more in the group that trained to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture was different for muscle size, which is shown in the upper part of the graph above. Researchers used ultrasound to measure various points along the mid and lateral quadriceps (MQ and LQ on the graph) as well as the biceps and triceps. In most (but not all) cases, training to failure produced bigger gains in mass—which might be ideal if you’re working out for aesthetic reasons, but not necessarily if you’re training for a weight-to-strength ratio sport like cycling or climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a key caveat here, which is that estimating reps in reserve is an inexact art. To check how inexact it was, the researchers sometimes asked their subjects to keep going after they’d estimated they had two reps left. The estimates were fairly good and got better over the course of the eight-week study. But these were experienced lifters who had presumably experienced true failure many times before. For newbies, &lt;a href="https://x.com/BradSchoenfeld/status/1913580395217506586" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Schoenfeld says&lt;/a&gt;, it’s probably a good idea to do at least some training to failure so that you know what it feels like. Then, once you have a good internal benchmark, switch to a reps-in-reserve approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this line of research reminds me of the current debate in the endurance world about &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/norwegian-endurance-training/" data-afl-p="0"&gt;Norwegian double-threshold training&lt;/a&gt;. The underlying premise of the Norwegian method is that hero workouts that leave you crumpled by the side of the track are counterproductive. Better to push hard enough to stimulate adaptation but not so hard that you can’t recover for the next workout. Those who hope to win bodybuilding competitions will undoubtedly—and wisely—keep lifting to failure. On the other hand, for those who want muscle and strength but care more deeply about tomorrow’s run, keeping a rep or two in reserve sounds like a great plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has green-lit a blood test that can help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. It is the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP.

A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" data-displayoverlay="displayOverlay" rel="noreferrer"&gt;first blood test to be cleared&lt;/a&gt; by the FDA for the disease, which affects more than 7 million older Americans and is marked by a decline in memory and thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;The test, called Lumipulse, can detect abnormal clumps of protein in the brain, known as amyloid plaques. These plaques disrupt brain cell function and are a hallmark of &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/difference-between-dementia-alzheimers/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia vs alzheimers"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;PET scans and spinal fluid tests can also detect amyloid plaques and have been used for years to help doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s. But the tests are expensive and, in the case of the lumbar puncture, invasive. They can also be inaccessible for people in rural areas. Lumipulse, on the other hand, requires only a blood draw in patients 55 and older who are showing signs and symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“Having a blood test just makes it so much easier in being able to make a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,” said Charles Bernick, M.D., a neurologist with the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, based in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;In its news release, the test’s manufacturer, Fujirebio Diagnostics, didn’t specify the cost of the test.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;People without symptoms shouldn’t test &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;The newly approved blood test measures two proteins in the liquid part of the blood, known as plasma, and then calculates the ratio of these proteins, which is “correlated to the presence or absence of amyloid plaques in the patient’s brain, reducing the need for a PET scan,” the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            
&lt;p&gt;The test is only meant for older adults who are experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease; &lt;a href="/health/brain-health/alzheimers-diagnosis-before-symptoms/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="alzheimer's diagnosis before symptoms"&gt;it is not a screening test&lt;/a&gt;. What’s more, the FDA said, the results should be used along with “other clinical evaluations or additional tests” to determine treatment options. In addition to brain imaging and lumbar punctures, doctors often use neurological exams and cognitive tests, for example, &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/dementia-diagnosis/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="dementia diagnosis"&gt;to diagnose a patient&lt;/a&gt; with Alzheimer’s disease. “It still becomes a diagnosis where you have to really look at the whole picture,” Bernick said.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the FDA has approved two medications for the &lt;a href="/health/conditions-treatments/alzheimers-treatments/" data-overlay-msg="AARP.Everywhere.LeavingModal.drawOverlay(this,'',/content/dam/content-fragments/aarp-org/en/article/health/conditions-treatments/2025/fda-approves-alzheimers-blood-test.html,'','You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply.');return false;" title="alzheimer's treatments"&gt;treatment of Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; — Kisunla (donanemab) and Leqembi (lecanemab). These drugs, which are given by infusion, don’t cure the disease but can help to slow the rate of decline in people in its early stages. Because they work by clearing amyloid plaques from the brain, the presence of amyloid must be confirmed before they can be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;



            
        
            &lt;p&gt;“They carry some risk. So if you’re going to use them or utilize them, you’ve got to be pretty sure the person has that protein in the brain,” Bernick said. Risks can include swelling and bleeding in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        &lt;/div&gt;

It’s just a spot I had since I was little,’” Gee, now 19, a biomedical engineering student at Texas A&amp;amp;M, tells TODAY.com. “They were like, ‘Well, we’ll let you wrestle this time, but you have to get it checked out.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gee visited a dermatologist and learned that the mole was cancerous. Soon after he was diagnosed with Stage 3 melanoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-01-6a461a.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Now almost 20, Sam Gee has been healthy since his treatment for melanoma at 15. He's studying biomedical engineering in college. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Gee family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was definitely surprised,” he says. “I was in shock.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A changing spot &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Gee had the mark on his back for as long as he could remember, it started to look different in the months before the wrestling tournament. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It almost looked like it was drying out,” he says. “I had the mole ever since I was young, but over the years it gradually (became) raised.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Still, he thought little of it. At the time, he was grappling with another unusual health change. About a month prior to tournament, Gee noticed a puffy bump in his upper right leg.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had some serious swelling,” he says. “I thought it was an inguinal hernia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Inguinal hernias occur when part of the intestine pokes through the abdomen near the groin and can look like a bump, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inguinal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351547" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. A visit with a pediatric surgeon revealed what it was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He was like, ‘It’s not a inguinal hernia, but likely a swollen lymph node,’” Gee recalls. “He’s like, ‘It’s just from puberty. … Come back in a few weeks if it hasn’t gone away.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gee then visited a doctor about the mole and underwent a biopsy, which revealed that he had melanoma. It had spread locally, causing the swollen lymph node in his leg. Doctors considered Mohs surgery, where skin is cut away layer by layer to remove the cancer with clear margins, but Gee needed immunotherapy first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the same time, school moved online as the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns had begun. That helped Gee manage some of the symptoms he experienced from immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I would get fatigued a little bit. It would make me nauseous,” he says. “It was a very day-to-day thing. Some days I would feel fantastic. Some days I would feel like I needed to throw up or I was really tired.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In January 2021, Gee underwent surgery and had the melanoma and lymph nodes removed. Following surgery, he completed several more rounds of immunotherapy before he finished treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was disease free,” he says. “That was when they said, ‘OK you’re cured.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Melanoma &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Melanoma occurs most often in “older white males,” and the average age of a patient with metastatic melanoma is in their 60s, says Dr. Hussein Tawbi. But it does occur in younger populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The No. 1 cause of cancer in women between age 30-40 is melanoma, for instance,” Tawbi, director of personalized cancer therapy in the department of melanoma medical oncology in the division of cancer medicine at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer center, tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt; But “pediatric melanoma is relatively rare," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-02-16f0b5.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since being diagnosed with melanoma, Sam Gee has become a 'total sunscreen freak.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Gee family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People often develop skin cancer, including melanoma, because of sun exposure. Tawbi urges people to start using sunscreen regularly in childhood, as sun exposure in adolescence and young adulthood increases the risk of metastatic melanoma later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a very direct relationship between sun exposure and a higher incidence of melanoma,” he says. "We do recommend people to start using sunscreen as early as possible.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He also urges people to undergo regular visits to a dermatologist to undergo skin checks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Early diagnosis is still key,” Tawbi says. “If you find the melanoma early enough, it is still largely curable with surgery alone.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts talk about the ABCDEs of skin cancer to help assess if a mole or mark on the skin is cause for concern. Any of these qualities should prompt a visit to the doctor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;: Asymmetry, when a mole doesn’t appear the same on both sides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;: Border, when the outside of the mole looks jagged or uneven&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;: Color, when the hue of the mole changes, becoming lighter, darker, white, red or blue &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;: Diameter, when a mole is larger than the size of a pencil eraser &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: Evolution, when a mole changes or appears to be different &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Surgery can cure 95-99% of early melanomas, Tawbi notes. For those who have advanced stage melanomas, either Stage 3 or 4, immunotherapies can often extend lives. Since about 2010, checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy — a type of treatment that uses the body’s immune system to better fight cancer — have transformed melanoma treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(They've) absolutely changed everything and started resulting for long-term survival for patients,” Tawbi says. “The survival for melanoma has actually increased by 10-fold.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before checkpoint inhibitors, the median survival time for metastatic melanomas like Gee's was seven months. Now it is 72 months, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s pretty pretty impressive,” he says. “The only way we got patients to have better survival rates in the last 10 years has been purely through research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;"Total sunscreen freak"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Before being diagnosed with cancer, Gee thought he would pursue electrical engineering or computer science. After his experience as a patient and seeing how technology improves medicine, he’s majoring in biomedical engineering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Seeing all those cool machines and wanting to make those threw me into biomed engineering,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Today, he’s a “total sunscreen freak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/sam-gee-melanoma-mc-250519-03-8b149b.jpg" alt="Sam Gee"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Since being diagnosed with melanoma at 15, Sam Gee always uses sunscreen to protect himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Gee family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m all about the sunscreen now,” he says. “I hope people will start wearing their sunscreen. … That’s really what I want to get across is wear sunscreen, don’t tan on purpose.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gee also hopes his story helps other young men with melanoma feel less isolated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You really don’t see that too much.

Many people type the name of their drug into a Google search. At the top of the list will be “side effects” and links to places like MedlinePlus, Mayo Clinic, GoodRx, Drugs.com, WebMD, Cleveland Clinic or RxList. But where does the drug side effect information &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; come from and is it reliable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Origins of Most Drug Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of virtually all drug information originates with the clinical trials conducted for FDA drug approval. The agency and the drug companies negotiate the final wording in the official prescribing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst things like dosing instructions, warnings and precautions and drug interactions, you will discover “&lt;strong&gt;ADVERSE REACTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;.” Virtually all the databases you will find online create lists based on the side effects located in the official prescribing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical words such as “pruritis” will be converted to itching. “Dyspepsia” becomes heartburn. “Hepatotoxicity” turns into liver damage. You get the picture. The basic information is the same, but the words may be a bit more understandable in the databases that try to translate drug side effect information for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Finding the Official Prescribing Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to find the key information about almost all drugs is by putting &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/"&gt;DailyMed&lt;/a&gt; into a search engine. &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/"&gt;Here is the URL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;And here is a description of “ABOUT DAILYMED”:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The National Library of Medicine (NLM)’s DailyMed searchable database provides the most recent labeling submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by companies and currently in use (i.e., “in use” labeling).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;USEFUL Drug Information Is a Rarity:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceuticals are among the most tested, analyzed and scrutinized consumer products in the world. Initial laboratory research and preclinical investigations lead to clinical trials and Food and Drug Administration review. The cost for developing a new medication can range from hundreds of millions to several billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why it comes as such a disappointment to discover that the end users of medications, patients, get so little practical information about the drugs they are expected to take. It’s very hard to tell how effective they will be to resolve a health issue. Patients also get much less practical information than they need about side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare medications with consumer products, for example. Whether it’s a smart phone, a refrigerator, a toaster oven or an automobile, numerous independent organizations test such products and provide quantitative information to assist consumers in making informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Car Information vs. Drug Information:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; (CR) and look up a popular car category, say compact SUVs, you will be told an overall score. At a glance, you can see how one vehicle compares to more than a dozen other vehicles in the same class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also be told the price, predicted reliability, owner satisfaction, overall miles per gallon, seat comfort, usability, noise, ride comfort, fit + finish, routine handling, acceleration and braking distance in feet from 60-0 mph in feet. For example, the Suburu Forester gets an overall CR rating of &lt;strong&gt;93&lt;/strong&gt; compared to the Hyundai Tucson which gets an overall score of &lt;strong&gt;76&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no such rating for medications. Rarely are drugs tested against each other. As a result, even health care professionals may find it tricky to compare one blood pressure medicine to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lisinopril: Effectiveness and Drug Side Effect Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the most commonly prescribed blood pressure medicine in America, lisinopril (&lt;strong&gt;Zestril&lt;/strong&gt;). Here’s a fundamental question: How much will lisinopril lower blood pressure? If you check the official prescribing information, you will not find a simple answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;You will be told instead that:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zestril was approximately equivalent to atenolol and metoprolol in reducing diastolic blood pressure, and had somewhat greater effects on systolic blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What About Drug Side Effect Information?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you put “lisinopril side effects” into a search engine, as many people do, you will find several sites, from the Mayo Clinic and GoodRx to Drugs.com and the Cleveland Clinic. The National Library of Medicine offers MedlinePlus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these databases list common side effects such as dizziness, headache, cough, excessive tiredness and decrease in sexual ability. Nowhere in such lists are there numbers to give a patient an idea of how likely such complications may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where Does the Drug Side Effect Information REALLY Come From and Is It Trustworthy?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical manufacturers conduct randomized controlled trials (&lt;strong&gt;RCTs&lt;/strong&gt;) to demonstrate that their new drugs are better than placebos. Without that, they don’t get to bring their medications to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RCTs are primarily designed to determine effectiveness.&lt;/strong&gt; Please hit your internal pause button for just a sec. Reread that sentence. Drug companies care about drug &lt;em&gt;effectiveness&lt;/em&gt;…a lot! If they can’t prove their “marvelous” new medicine is better than placebo, they are usually out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the FDA sometimes bends its own rules a bit and approves a drug that barely demonstrates effectiveness. You can read about one such example &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/new-alzheimers-drug-aduhelm-breakthrough-or-boondoggle"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, though, the FDA is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supposed to approve any medication that does not work better than nothing (placebo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug companies are also required to collect information about side effects. But that is where the system gets squirrelly!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gathering Drug Side Effect Information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways this kind of information is gathered. The specific choices a study sponsor makes can have an important impact on our understanding of the drug’s risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps the researchers need to take in planning their trial is to decide who will be included (and, just as critical, who gets excluded). Until several decades ago, many trials didn’t include women. Scientists didn’t want to have to deal with potential variables such as menstrual cycles or pregnancy. At the same time, they just assumed that side effects would be the same—an assumption that hasn’t always been substantiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study subjects may also be younger or healthier than the patients who will eventually be taking the medication. This simplifies the study, because the researchers don’t have to take multiple health conditions and additional medications into account. But it may also limit the usefulness of the side effect information gathered from the clinical trial. The real world is messy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pitfall at the planning phase is how many people will be included. Clinical trials are expensive, so often they do not include enough subjects to be likely to reveal a rare or even uncommon reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is the actual process by which pharmaceutical companies collect drug side effect information. There is substantial variability in the way questions are asked about adverse drug reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Do Drug Companies Ask Questions?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I were to ask you if you have experienced a headache recently, what would you say? A lot of people experience headaches on a regular basis. Once you stop to think about it, you might easily say yes. Ditto for indigestion or trouble sleeping or diarrhea. The very act of asking about a symptom can trigger a positive response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a researcher informs subjects in a clinical trial that the drug being tested is capable of causing headaches, indigestion, insomnia and diarrhea, the volunteers might very well be super vigilant for such complications. Even if they were to get the placebo, they would be primed to report one or more of those side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the data are analyzed, the company might report that the volunteers getting active drug complained of headaches &lt;strong&gt;7%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time. The participants in the placebo group noted headaches &lt;strong&gt;6.8%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time. The conclusion might be that there is &lt;em&gt;no difference&lt;/em&gt; between the two groups and that the drug does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; cause headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that would be false; the placebo group was primed to report such an adverse reaction. To read more about this flaw in the system, check out &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/randomized-controlled-trials-rcts-a-flawed-gold-standard"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. It discusses a landmark study by Dr. Jerry Avorn and colleagues involving antidepressant medications. It was published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19810776/"&gt;Drug Safety&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comparing Drug Side Effect Information for 2 Identical Drugs (Ozempic and Wegovy):&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have, no doubt, heard about the GLP-1 agonist drugs &lt;strong&gt;Ozempic&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Wegovy&lt;/strong&gt;. They are both semaglutide. Ozempic was approved for diabetes and Wegovy was approved for weight loss. From our perspective, the clinical trials should have produced somewhat similar side effect profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official prescribing information reports that &lt;strong&gt;20.3%&lt;/strong&gt; of the patients on Ozempic complained of nausea while only &lt;strong&gt;6.1%&lt;/strong&gt; of those on placebo reported nausea. Contrast that with the identical medicine Wegovy: &lt;strong&gt;42%&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;44%&lt;/strong&gt; of subjects on Wegovy reported nausea. Those getting placebo shots of Wegovy reported nausea &lt;strong&gt;16-18%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stop. Reflect! We are comparing nausea from placebo to nausea from placebo. Those getting placebo injections in the Wegovy trial had about &lt;strong&gt;3 times&lt;/strong&gt; the incidence of nausea than those getting placebo injections in the Ozempic trials. Smells kind of fishy, don’t you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarrhea was even more bizarre. Those getting &lt;strong&gt;placebo&lt;/strong&gt; shots in the Ozempic clinical trials reported diarrhea &lt;strong&gt;1.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time. The subjects getting &lt;strong&gt;placebo&lt;/strong&gt; shots in the Wegovy clinical trial reported diarrhea &lt;strong&gt;16-19%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time. That’s about a &lt;strong&gt;10 fold&lt;/strong&gt; difference. We’re talking placebo compared to placebo. It should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be different! Or, if there were a psychological factor at work, it should not have been &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; different! We think there is a BIG problem with how such side effect information is collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overlooking Adverse Drug Reactions!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is another very serious flaw in the way pharmaceutical companies collect drug side effect information. If they do not “catch” an adverse reaction during the smallish preliminary phase 2 safety studies, they are not likely to look for an adverse reaction during the major clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, prescribers don’t always recognize this shortcoming. We can’t tell you how often a reader has written to say that their physician dismissed a problem with the drug because he or she couldn’t find the side effect listed in the prescribing information. Yet adverse effects often crop up &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; after drug approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prozac and Sexual Side Effects!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example of this is the antidepressant fluoxetine (&lt;strong&gt;Prozac&lt;/strong&gt;). When the FDA first approved this drug for depression, the prescribing information suggested that a relatively small number of people (3%) might have sexual difficulties while taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little by little, patients and their doctors began to realize that was a serious underestimate. As many as half of patients on fluoxetine in one study had reduced libido, erectile dysfunction or trouble achieving orgasm (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23538970/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease&lt;/em&gt;, April 2013&lt;/a&gt;). In other studies of healthy individuals, the rate rose as high as 80 percent (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31591339/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Oct. 7, 2019&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of adverse drug reaction is not one people are eager to discuss, so if the study supervisors waited for spontaneous reports, they could have missed the signal on what turned out to be a common rather than a rare side effect. Early clinical trials usually don’t catch suicidal thoughts and acts either. It seems counterintuitive that a drug for depression might trigger suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Examples of Missed Drug Side Effect information:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Statins and Blood Sugar:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot tell you how many times clinical trials completely missed catching serious drug side effects. Statin-type cholesterol-lowering drugs can raise blood sugar. People with diabetes may also have a harder time controlling their blood glucose when put on a statin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our readers told us about these complications in 2002, long before the FDA or the companies discovered them. You can read the sad saga &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/do-statins-cause-or-aggravate-type-2-diabetes"&gt;at this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Zolpidem and GERD:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our readers alerted us to heartburn associated with the sleeping pill zolpidem (&lt;strong&gt;Ambien&lt;/strong&gt;). The official prescribing information lists “gastroesophageal reflux disease” (GERD) and abdominal discomfort at 1%. Judging from reports from our readers, though, the incidence could be significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cetirizine and Rebound Itching:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had to arm wrestle the FDA to look into rebound itching when people stop the antihistamines cetirizine (&lt;strong&gt;Zyrtec&lt;/strong&gt;) or levocetirizine (&lt;strong&gt;Xyzal&lt;/strong&gt;). This complication was not discovered during clinical trials of these allergy meds. There is no warning on the OTC labels of these antihistamines. You can read about &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/cetirizine-zyrtec-withdrawal-unbearable-itching"&gt;this problem here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 16, 2025, the FDA issued a warning about cetirizine (Zyrtec) and levocetirizine (Xyzal). Here is the headline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“What safety concern is FDA announcing?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;“The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning that patients stopping the oral allergy medicines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cetirizine (Zyrtec) or levocetirizine (Xyzal) after long-term use may experience rare but severe itching. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;These medicines are available in prescription and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;over-the-counter (OTC) forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;. The itching, also called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;pruritus, has been reported in patients who used these medicines daily, typically for at least a few &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;months and often for years. Patients did not experience itching before starting the medicines. Reported &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;cases were rare but sometimes serious, with patients experiencing widespread, severe itching that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;required medical intervention. As a result, we are revising the prescription cetirizine and levocetirizine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;prescribing information&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; to include a new warning about this risk. We will subsequently request that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;manufacturers add a warning about pruritus to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;Drug Facts Label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; of the OTC versions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fluoroquinolones (FQs) &amp;amp; Tendons &amp;amp; So Much More:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tongue twister fluoroquinolones (&lt;strong&gt;FQs&lt;/strong&gt;) may not be familiar to you. These are antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (&lt;strong&gt;Cipro&lt;/strong&gt;) or levofloxacin (&lt;strong&gt;Levaquin&lt;/strong&gt;). They used to be prescribed regularly for sinusitis, cystitis, prostatitis, bronchitis and skin infections. They were perceived as highly effective and quite safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long after these drugs were approved and prescribed promiscuously, it was discovered that they could cause devastating complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;These include:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…disabling and potentially permanent side effects of the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“…disturbances in attention, disorientation, agitation, nervousness, memory impairment and delirium. In addition, the FDA is concerned about the potential for hypoglycemic coma. This occurs when blood sugar levels drop precipitously. Hypoglycemic coma is a potentially life-threatening complication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started asking the FDA about FQ dangers to the heart and the aorta in 2014. That’s because readers had alerted us to the risk of aortic aneurysms and other serious vascular complications. There was nothing in the prescribing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;It took the FDA until December 20, 2018 to warn that FQ antibiotics were linked to :&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ruptures or tears in the main artery of the body, called the aorta. These tears, called aortic dissections, or ruptures of an aortic aneurysm can lead to dangerous bleeding or even death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can You Rely Upon Drug Side Effect Information?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could go on and on citing example after example, but you should be fed up by now. The bottom line of this article is that you may not be able to rely on official prescribing information when assessing possible side effects of your medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA does not seem terribly concerned about the ways drug companies have been able to manipulate the collection of adverse drug reaction data. Norwegian researchers describe “biases in reporting of adverse effects in clinical trials” in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36125975/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Basic &amp;amp; Clinical Pharmacology &amp;amp; Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;, Dec. 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The authors report that:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of common definitions and monitoring methods for adverse effects is likely to be valid across all medical areas and is potentially a large source of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bias may be expected if study design is suboptimal, patient monitoring not clearly defined, outcomes diffuse, and reporting selective. For readers, absence of relevant data may be difficult to notice unless an article is subjected to close scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings confirm the results of other researchers and show considerable pitfalls in identification and reporting of adverse effects in clinical trials. Some biases are caused by methods choices including study design and patient monitoring, and others are caused by use of thresholds, filters, and selective reporting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One Final Example:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;TV drug commercials are especially vexing. An announcer speeds through a long list of adverse reactions. For example, an ad for &lt;strong&gt;Rinvoq&lt;/strong&gt; to treat rheumatoid arthritis includes these warnings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Rinvoq can lower your ability to fight infections, including tuberculosis. Serious infections and blood clots, sometimes fatal, have occurred, as have certain cancers, including lymphoma, and tears in the stomach or intestines and changes in lab results.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This scary information is crucial but does not tell patients how common these side effects may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Can You Do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you cannot rely on the FDA-approved information found in &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/"&gt;DailyMed&lt;/a&gt;, then you certainly cannot rely upon the drug side effect information found during an online search. Remember, everything traces back to the official prescribing information. If that is flawed, then all the databases are equally flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can you do? First, trust your body. If you suspect an adverse reaction to a medicine and it is not listed as a drug side effect, you may be right and the official prescribing information may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discuss your concerns with your doctor. If she dismisses the problem because it is not listed in her drug side effect information, point her to this article. It just might convince your doctor that her computerized drug database is not all it’s cracked up to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please share your thoughts in the comment section below. If you have ever experienced a drug side effect that was not “officially” recognized, please relate your story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe this article contains important information, why not send it along to friends, family and health professionals?

&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of semaglutide drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy for weight loss, surveys suggest that most people still &lt;a href="https://pcrm.widen.net/s/ddlsxvhlvp/pcrm-mc-weight-loss-report-9.27.24"&gt;prefer to lose weight without using medications&lt;/a&gt;. For those preferring a drug-free approach to weight loss, research shows that certain nutrients and dietary strategies can naturally mimic the effects of semaglutides.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Increased intakes of fibre and monounsaturated fats (found in olive oil and avocadoes) — as well as the time of day when foods are eaten, the order that foods are eaten in, the speed of eating and even chewing — can naturally stimulate increased production of the same hormone responsible for the effects of semaglutide drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a family physician with a PhD in nutrition, I translate the latest nutrition science into dietary recommendations for my patients. A strategic approach to weight loss rooted in the latest science is not only superior to antiquated calorie counting, but also capitalizes on the same biological mechanisms responsible for the success of popular weight-loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide medications work by increasing the levels of a hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1), a satiety signal that slows digestion and makes us feel full. These drugs also simultaneously decrease levels of an enzyme called DPP-4, which inactivates GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, this “stop eating” hormone that naturally survives for only a few minutes can survive for an entire week. This enables a semi-permanent, just-eaten sensation of fullness that consequently leads to decreased food intake and, ultimately, weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, medications aren’t the only way to raise GLP-1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-you-eat"&gt;What you eat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fibre — predominantly found in beans, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds — is the most notable nutrient that can significantly increase GLP-1. When fibre is fermented by the trillions of bacteria that live in our intestines, the resultant byproduct, called short chain fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aao5774"&gt;stimulates the production of GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may explain why fibre consumption is one of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxz117"&gt;strongest predictors of weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqz292"&gt;shown to enable weight loss&lt;/a&gt; even in the absence of calorie restriction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Monounsaturated fats — found in olive oil and avocado oil — are another nutrient that raises GLP-1. One study showed that GLP-1 levels were higher &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/69.6.1135"&gt;following the consumption of bread and olive oil&lt;/a&gt; compared to bread and butter. Though notably, bread consumed with any kind of fat (be it from butter or even cheese) &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2013.275"&gt;raises GLP-1 more than bread alone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another study showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu11050952"&gt;having an avocado&lt;/a&gt; alongside your breakfast bagel also increases GLP-1 more so than eating the bagel on its own. Nuts that are high in both fibre and monounsaturated fats, like pistachios, have also been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2013.275"&gt;shown to raise GLP-1 levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-you-eat"&gt;How you eat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the specific foods and nutrients that influence GLP-1 levels are only half the story. GLP-1 is a good example of how it’s not just what you eat that matters, it’s also how you eat it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show that meal sequence — the order foods are eaten in — can impact GLP-1. Eating protein, like fish or meat, before carbohydrates, like rice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-015-3841-z"&gt;results in a higher GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; compared to eating carbohydrates before protein. Eating vegetables before carbohydrates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/ijpvm.IJPVM_704_20"&gt;has a similar effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time of day also matters, because like all hormones, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.991397"&gt;GLP-1 follows a circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;. A meal eaten at 8 a.m. stimulates a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-0366"&gt;more pronounced release of GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; compared to the same meal at 5 p.m. This may partly explain why the old saying “eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper” is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20460"&gt;backed by evidence&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrates greater weight loss when breakfast is the largest meal of the day and dinner is the smallest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The speed of eating can matter, too. Eating ice cream over 30 minutes has been shown to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-1018"&gt;produce a significantly higher GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; compared to eating ice cream over five minutes. However, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15051174"&gt;studies looking at blood sugar responses&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that if vegetables are eaten first, the speed of eating becomes less important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even chewing matters. One study showed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-58103-w"&gt;eating shredded cabbage raised GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; more than drinking pureed cabbage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-as-potent-as-medication"&gt;Not as potent as medication&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While certain foods and dietary strategies can increase GLP-1 naturally, the magnitude is far less than what is achievable with medications. One study of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/dmrr.3406"&gt;GLP-1 raising effects of the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated a peak GLP-1 level of approximately 59 picograms per millilitre of blood serum. The product monograph for Ozempic reports that the lowest dose &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/209637lbl.pdf"&gt;produces a GLP-1 level&lt;/a&gt; of 65 nanograms per millilitre (one nanogram = 1,000 picograms). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So medications raise GLP-1 more than one thousand times higher than diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, when you compare long-term risk for diseases like heart attacks, the &lt;a href="https://www.dietitians.ca/DietitiansOfCanada/media/Documents/Mediterranean%20Diet%20Toolkit/Mediterranean-Diet-Toolkit-A-Guide-to-Healthy-Eating-(handout).pdf"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa1800389"&gt;lowers risk of cardiac events by 30 per cent&lt;/a&gt;, outperforming GLP-1 medications that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563"&gt;lower risk by 20 per cent&lt;/a&gt;. While weight loss will always be faster with medications, for overall health, dietary approaches are superior to medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following strategies are important for those trying to lose weight without a prescription:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat breakfast&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Strive to make breakfast the largest meal of the day (or at least frontload your day as much as possible)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Aim to eat at least one fibre-rich food at every meal&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Make olive oil a dietary staple&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Be mindful of the order that you eat foods in, consume protein and vegetables before carbohydrates&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Snack on nuts&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chew your food&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Eat slowly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While natural approaches to raising GLP-1 may not be as potent as medications, they provide a drug-free approach to weight loss and healthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;

If left untreated people may experience flu-like symptoms like a headache, muscle pains and aches and fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe untreated cases of Lyme disease can cause facial paralysis, vision changes and issues with memory and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A person contracts Lyme disease from the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also called the deer tick, pictured above (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lyme disease cases in the US are on the rise, with cases hitting a high of of 89,470 in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness is easier to treat when caught early and doctors typically prescribe a 28-day regimen of antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, because of the non-specific symptoms of Lyme disease, many cases can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Generally, ticks must be attached to a person for at least 24 hours in order to transmit the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Performing tick checks after possible exposure is vital to quickly identify if you've been bitten and to remove the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deer ticks are common in northeastern and midwestern states, such as Connecticut, New York, Minnesota and Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC, which has Lyme disease data through 2023, shows New Jersey had the fourth-highest number of Lyme disease cases that year, falling behind New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It recorded 7,224 cases. New York saw 22,170 cases; Pennsylvania reported 16,670; and Massachusetts reported 9,715. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the US is seeing a record number of Lyme disease cases - recording 89,470 cases in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease area is also expanding.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2003&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2013&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a map of where Lyme disease cases were reported in the US in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent testing on human and tick samples suggests millions more Americans could be at risk because the tick that causes Lyme disease is spreading to new geographical areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts don't know exactly why the tick is traveling, but some posit it is due to development or climate change, and cases could be on the rise because of increased education and awareness surrounding ticks and Lyme disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid Lyme disease, it is important to wear long sleeves and long pants to prevent ticks from being able to attach themselves to your skin and perform thorough tick checks after spending time in the outdoors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You can also wear repellant and treat clothing with acaricides, special pesticides used to kill ticks and mites.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ticks can also infect animals, so it is important to check pets for the parasites or signs of a bite and give them preventatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you do find a tick, use tweezers to remove it and save it so it can be identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s a little embarrassing. But I’m in good company: approximately one in three people are &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/motion-sickness/#frequency" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;considered&lt;/a&gt; “highly susceptible to motion sickness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/madeleine-aggeler","type":"Contributor","title":"Madeleine Aggeler","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/10/31/Madeline_Aggeler.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=941aa4893ff7a0165c0d43241305e14e","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2023/10/31/Madeline_Aggeler.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=237d41eba137320866c62c54d68129d8"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"wellness/2025/may/19/what-causes-motion-sickness","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;What exactly is motion sickness, and why do some people experience it so much more than others? We asked experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What is motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Motion sickness is a generic term that encompasses all sorts of travel sickness, including sea sickness, air sickness and car sickness, says Dr John Golding, professor of applied psychology at the University of Westminster, in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But you don’t need to travel to experience its unpleasant symptoms, which can include nausea, vomiting, burping, drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and blurred vision. When the Lumière brothers first screened a motion picture for the public in 1895, some people in the audience started feeling dizzy and sick, says Golding. This is known as “visually induced motion sickness”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dc137228-1ee0-4d21-bf7f-08a6dc5c4f4e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Athletes and fitness influencers use creatine, but what is it?

Your body uses visual stimuli, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/18/the-power-of-proprioception-how-to-improve-your-sixth-sense-and-become-healthier-and-happier" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;proprioception&lt;/a&gt; (the body’s ability to perceive itself in space) and the vestibular system (structures inside the inner ear that help you maintain a sense of balance) to sense where your body is and how it is moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Usually, these three mechanisms are in sync. But when one of them isn’t – say, you’re reading a static page in the car, but your vestibular system still senses that you’re moving – this sensory conflict confuses the brain. “This neurological tension is what triggers common symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and vomiting,” explains Dr Safia Debar, a general practitioner and executive health physician at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the case of the Lumière brothers’ first audiences, their vestibular systems and senses of proprioception told them they were still, but their eyes told them they were moving. Today, many people experience this sort of visually induced motion sickness when using virtual-reality headsets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-movements-cause-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What kinds of movements cause motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One of the most common misconceptions about motion sickness is that the strength of the movement determines the severity of the reaction, says Golding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But people don’t tend to get motion sickness when they’re bouncing up and down on horseback; that is a “higher frequency” movement, says Golding. Slower-frequency movements, like the rocking of a ship at sea, or the swaying of a bus, are more likely to result in motion sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-do-some-people-experience-motion-sickness-more-than-others" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Why do some people experience motion sickness more than others?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So why can one person read endlessly in a car while even a quick glimpse at a phone turns another person green?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A number of factors seem to influence one’s proneness to motion sickness, says Dr Behrang Keshavarz, senior scientist at the Kite Research Institute and professor in the department of psychology at Toronto Metropolitan University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One is age: motion sickness tends to peak in children between the ages of 8 and 12. “Adults are usually better than kids with motion sickness,” says Keshavarz. But that’s not true for everyone, he clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Research suggests people assigned female at birth are more likely to experience motion sickness than those assigned male at birth, says Keshavarz, though no one’s quite sure why. Genetics may also play a role, says Golding, adding that studies indicate motion sickness might be 50-70% heritable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"d493857e-ede7-4ad1-8084-f39fbf3be02b","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="d493857e-ede7-4ad1-8084-f39fbf3be02b" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some individuals may also be better at adapting to strange new motions than others, suggests Dr Thomas A Stoffregen, emeritus professor of kinesiology at the University of Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some people are ‘naturally coordinated’ and can learn new motor skills quickly,” he says over email. “Others (like me) are klutzes and take forever to learn new movements.” The latter are more at risk for motion sickness, he argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-21" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(I would like to see this printed on the little airplane vomit bags I so often end up breathing into during landings.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not about being delicate or anxious,” says Debar. “Some people are simply more sensitive to motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About half of novice astronauts get space sick during training, Golding adds. “They’re very fit, very highly motivated and not weak-willed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I nod. Sitting in the back of a Kia Sorento is a lot like going into space, I tell myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-possible-to-reduce-the-effects-of-motion-sickness" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is it possible to reduce the effects of motion sickness?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are two approaches to dealing with motion sickness: behavioral and pharmacological.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a3eb59be-d613-4c40-b61e-e5ca3944587b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":28,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"My hours seem to slip away.

Sit in the front seat of a car when you can, keep your eyes on the horizon, and avoid reading and screens, says Debar. She also notes that ginger has some natural anti-nausea effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pleasant music, fresh air, nice smells and a generally pleasant ambiance may be able to distract you, says Keshavarz. He also suggests car passengers copy the movements of the driver. Drivers rarely get motion sickness because they can anticipate the movements of the car and lean into turns, for example. “If you mimic what the driver does, that helps,” Keshavarz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Unfortunately, the most effective way to combat motion sickness is also the least pleasant: habituation. In other words, doing the activity over and over again until it doesn’t give you motion sickness anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is by far the most effective countermeasure,” says Golding, who used it to help desensitize Royal Air Force pilots to air sickness. “It doesn’t have side effects, but it’s very time consuming and can be stimulus specific,” he says – meaning that habituating to car sickness won’t necessarily help you with sea sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Over-the-counter anti-nausea medication can be effective, experts say, but they often cause drowsiness. Transdermal patches such as Scopolamine are also helpful for up to three days, but can take six to 10 hours to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Timing is important for such medications, says Golding. Even pills might take 30 minutes to an hour to take effect. And you must take them before you start to feel sick, because once you start to experience motion sickness, your stomach goes into gastric stasis, meaning it is no longer emptying its contents into the gut. “That means you might have taken the pill, but it’s not going anywhere,” says Golding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Finally, you can always “vote with your feet”, says Golding. “Avoid situations where you get sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOSHZLUldIT1puQXN1NFZ3OUdDdThPYjN4NjZGVE8wWF8yTk1xRXhNcEUxS3dyR3M3ZE91V0RScDF6WTdHQ1JXeWxqSGctdUVHdTJvN0JYOUpCWXNuOFZ6MzZ0bUtZWVZFVkx0VmZIZXdhSkZfbEpCWnd6RndhRGJBVFNR</guid></item><item><title>马萨诸塞州布里格姆将军的研究发现，常见的止痛药可能会延长脑癌患者的生存期-《波士顿环球报》 | Common pain drug may prolong survival for brain cancer patients, Mass General Brigham study finds - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxONUU3eVJJSGF0TWdaZF9rYVBOLW5IajdKQ3hkNTJUQkRvcFR3Ni11b1E4cWc4eHA2Q3B1bi10UWRSNndGd1dxbjk2RzY1aUtBNGtobEdSei0zeFBwODJLNjVmMUxyWENVQ0hYelJNaTExSVRYRnFuTnZSMnRqUUREMEktdmJOQjdrZ0FzRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="lead | border_box gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet relative"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A widely prescribed medication may offer new hope for patients battling glioblastoma, an aggressive tumor that accounts for the majority of malignant brain cancers in adults and carries one of the bleakest prognoses in oncology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Patients who took gabapentin — a drug commonly used to treat nerve pain and seizures — lived several months longer than those who didn’t, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59614-4" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59614-4"&gt;a new study published this week in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The findings come from a retrospective analysis by research teams at Mass General Brigham and the University of California, San Francisco. Glioblastoma affects about 12,000 Americans each year, and despite ongoing research, survival rates have barely improved: most patients die within 12 to 14 months of diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The idea for the study emerged from its lead author, Dr. Joshua Bernstock, and what he called his “emerging obsession” with cancer neuroscience — a growing field that examines how tumors manipulate the nervous system to grow and survive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In 2023, researchers on the West Coast published a study showing that gliomas — a broad category of brain tumors that includes glioblastoma — integrate into neural circuits and use a protein called thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) to fuel their growth. Bernstock knew that gabapentin was shown in earlier research to interfere with TSP-1 activity, and was struck by the potential implications. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I looked at it three times the day it came out and said, ‘Oh my God,’” said Bernstock, a clinical fellow in neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “This wasn’t some novel experimental therapy. This was something already on the shelf, already being prescribed to patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bernstock’s team combed through the medical records of 693 glioblastoma patients treated at Mass General Brigham. Many had been prescribed gabapentin to treat chronic nerve pain. Those patients had a median survival of 16 months — four months longer than those not on the drug.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To test whether the trend held up elsewhere, the team partnered with UC San Francisco researchers who reviewed data from 379 additional patients. Their results showed an even greater gap: patients taking gabapentin lived 20.8 months on average, compared to 14.7 months for those who didn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bernstock emphasized that while the findings are promising, only a randomized clinical trial can confirm gabapentin’s true effect. But the biology supports the hypothesis. Patients who took gabapentin showed lower levels of TSP-1 in their blood, and the team controlled for as many confounding variables as possible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We know it’s biologically plausible,” Bernstock said. “That, plus the drop in serum [found in blood] TSP-1, makes us think this is the probable mechanism.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He hopes the data will justify launching prospective trials — some of which are already in the early stages of recruitment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Glioblastoma’s resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, combined with its highly heterogeneous nature — meaning no two tumors are exactly alike, even within the same patient — has stalled progress for decades and made breakthroughs rare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is just such a challenging disease,” Bernstock said. “Gradual steps forward are going to be meaningful.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Even a few extra months can be life-changing for patients and their families.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“You haven’t seen these people in clinic,” Bernstock said. “You’ve never had a father who wants to see his daughter graduate, or a mom who wants to help get the family’s affairs in order before she passes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Those human stories, he added, are what drives him to keep searching for new answers in the lab. “It’s actually horrifying to sit across from someone and know you can’t help them with what’s conventionally available,” he said. “That’s what motivates me to keep pushing.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

However, the protein craze could mean we’re eating too much for our own good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s always been trends around foods that are extreme,” physiologist George Wells, Ph.D., told &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;. “We had low fat, then low sugar, and now we happen to have high protein. The extremes tend to catch people’s attention. But they’re not good for us and they never last.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the protein craze, we’re pushing an important nutrient to the side: fiber. Accredited Practicing Dietitian Kim Lindsay says fiber is ignored because carbohydrates have been demonized and feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When there's a trend towards a low-carb, higher protein, if we're reducing the amount of carbohydrates that we're eating, we're going to naturally reduce the amount of fiber that we're taking in, right?” Lindsay explained. “We have to have a balanced &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; where we include plant foods, protein-containing foods, and fats in our diet.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, balance is being pushed aside for protein-rich eggs, meat and seafood. Snacks previously called “junk food” are getting a wellness makeover, with added protein now found in many bars, chips and gummies. Even the Kardashians are on board, with Khloe Kardashian recently &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJEfXdrpOO_/"&gt;launching her protein popcorn&lt;/a&gt;, “Kloud,” which offers seven grams of protein per one cup of popcorn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://foodinsight.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf"&gt;The International Food Information Council’s annual survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 71 percent of consumers were trying to increase their protein intake this year, a 6 percent rise from 2023. The survey also found that exposure to food and nutrition content online, much of which is protein focused, is up by 54 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, protein is an essential macronutrient to help bodily functions, like fighting infection, providing energy, and building and maintaining muscle mass. Intake depends on body weight, with general guidance being that a just over a third of the calories we consume each day should come from protein. So, with the average American woman weighing around 171 pounds, she should consume about 62 grams of protein a day. The average American man, at around 200 pounds, should eat about 72 grams of protein daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dcuwoN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-84388"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;(Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Wells believes that due to social media, we’re only focused on having as much protein as possible. “I think the craze around protein right now probably is linked to bodybuilding and the obsession with body composition — looking like you have the six-pack abs,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that ignores the flip side. “If you have too much protein, it's really hard for the body to deal with all of the amino acids that are floating around,” Wells added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where fiber comes in handy. Typically found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, fiber is particularly beneficial to your digestive system and keeping you regular. While men should have about 38 grams a day and women should have 25 grams, as noted by dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick, you shouldn’t just jump into doing that if you’ve been eating way less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber intake should be tailored to the individual and the microbiome. However, if you are well under this amount, you should go slow to allow the body adequate time to adjust,” Kirkpatrick, the owner of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kristinkirkpatrick.com/"&gt;KAK nutrition consulting,&lt;/a&gt; explained. She added that fiber can also prevent certain cancers and type 2 diabetes and improve heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 gTGbNB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-84389"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;(Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies have found a fiber deficiency among Americans. According to a study published in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/#bibr10-1559827615588079"&gt;the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, only five percent of the population has the recommended amount of fiber a day. Inadequate intake can result in health issues like chronic constipation and gastrointestinal problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to avoiding high-processed foods just because they’ve got extra protein added to them, we should focus on eating real foods that are naturally high in fiber rather than ultra-processed foods with bits of fiber in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gravitate towards highly processed foods because they're engineered to taste fantastic,” Wells said. ”They're high in sugar and salts, and we crave them as a result. There’s no real incentive for the processed foods to be satiating. They're great for business, but they're really not very good for our health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 15:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOVWJ1d3h3MkxQYUJIbjFoNDlaRFpJZlFwNXhPbkRnOFV3eE9aaXlSZ1l4YWY4MEY3V3VZcEFBR25WVFB0dlg2WEYxc1pXdVhSMkhOcUl2bEYyMGZQN0ZsMGUxTU9ub1FUWHhWaUVtTEk3Qkd5b1N6V2sxSDlmNlRiTTBiSVM3dEhtRGg0OGpFVjU4SVdqZERDNy1CMGVyRDh3dmsxSlMxeGJMY2dPdmZJ</guid></item></channel></rss>
