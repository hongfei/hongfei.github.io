Found in virtually every tissue in the body, prostaglandins react to pain by producing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While lowering excessive amounts of inflammation helps stop pain signals, small amounts of inflammation are crucial for helping the body fight off infections and heal from injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means taking an NSAID not only eases pain but also reduces essential inflammation the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at NYU Langone Pain Center in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-25841710-9a20-11f0-b3ef-a9cd0ad000c9"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, however, discovered how to target prostaglandin-producing receptors without eliminating vital inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, the researchers looked specifically at prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in Schwann cells, which are found outside the brain in the peripheral nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This system is a network of nerves connecting the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body and Schwann cells are thought to be behind migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers in New York City are testing the effects of pain relievers that target pain but not inflammation, which is needed in small doses for healing and fighting off infections (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers said drugs that target pain but not inflammation would reduce the need for NSAIDs, which are sold under brand names like Advil (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found PGE2 has four different receptors. Of those, the team found that EP2 specifically is responsible for pain, while EP4 influences inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They then used unspecified pre-clinical drugs on mice to target just the EP2 receptor. This reduced pain without affecting inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pierangelo Geppetti, study author and adjunct professor at the NYU Pain Research Center, said: 'Inflammation can be good for you - it repairs and restores normal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Inhibiting inflammation with NSAIDs may delay healing and could delay recovery from pain. A better strategy to treat prostaglandin-mediated pain would be to selectively reduce the pain without affecting inflammation’s protective actions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery comes amid a rift in the scientific community regarding another pain reliever, acetaminophen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15123181/trump-links-tylenol-autism-cause-leucovorin.html"&gt;President Donald Trump earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; tied the pain reliever acetaminophen, sold under the brand name Tylenol, during pregnancy to an increased risk of a child developing autism, despite inconclusive evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63782-8"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, looked at samples of human Schwann cells to determine which receptors to target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking at mouse models, the team found injecting pre-clinical drugs, or those that are being studied but are not available to the public, into mice reduced their pain levels while leaving inflammation untouched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Geppetti said: 'To our great surprise, blocking the EP2 receptor in Schwann cells abolished prostaglandin-mediated pain but the inflammation took its normal course. We effectively decoupled the inflammation from the pain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study findings come days after President Donald Trump (pictured here with health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr) tied pain reliever acetaminophen to autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Acetaminophen is sold under the brand name Tylenol, as well as other over-the-counter medications like Benadryl (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Developing drugs that only target EP2 would effectively eliminate the need for NSAIDs, which make up 30billion doses in the US every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And long-term NSAID use has also been tied to gastrointestinal and kidney damage, so the researchers believe moving away from NSAIDs would help reduce these risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostaglandins also stimulate the production of a protective mucus lining in the stomach, so a reduction in all prostaglandins - which occurs when NSAIDs target all receptors, not just the one that controls pain - wears away at that layer and leaves the stomach lining vulnerable to acid and other contaminants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NSAIDs also reduce blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract, which makes it harder for the stomach lining to repair itself. Blood flow to the kidneys is also reduced, which hampers function over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear which specific drugs the researchers used in the study and when they might be available to the public.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Geppetti said: 'Selective EP2 receptor antagonists could be very useful. While more research is needed on side effects, especially with giving a drug systemically as a pill, targeted administration that acts locally on an area like a knee joint holds promise.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new, highly potent class of immunotherapeutics with unique Velcro-like binding properties can kill diverse cancer types without harming normal tissue, University of California, Irvine cancer researchers have demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A team led by Michael Demetriou, MD, Ph.D., has reported that by targeting cancer-associated complex carbohydrate chains called glycans with binding proteins, they could penetrate the protective shields of tumor cells and trigger their death without toxicity to surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their biologically engineered immunotherapies—glycan-dependent T cell recruiter (GlyTR, pronounced 'glitter') compounds, GlyTR1 and GlyTR 2—proved safe and effective in models for a spectrum of cancers, including those of the breast, colon, lung, ovaries, pancreas and prostate, the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)01032-3" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's the holy grail—one treatment to kill virtually all cancers," said Demetriou, a professor of neurology, microbiology and molecular genetics at the UC Irvine School of Medicine and the paper's corresponding author. "GlyTR's velcro-like sugar-binding technology addresses the two major issues limiting current cancer immunotherapies: distinguishing cancer from normal tissue and cancer's ability to suppress the immune system."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Landmark research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study's publication, the culmination of a decade of research, is a watershed moment and source of pride for UC Irvine and the UCI Health Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This landmark study is a paradigm shift with the very real potential to change how we treat &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;," said Marian Waterman, Ph.D., former deputy director of research at the cancer center and champion of the project since Demetriou, a UCI Health neurologist, began working on the concept in 2015 with his then-postdoctoral fellow, Raymond W. Zhou, the study's first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added Richard A. Van Etten, MD, Ph.D., director of the cancer center and an early supporter of the GlyTR project, "This novel technology may, for the first time, allow the widespread application of targeted T-cell therapy to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/solid+tumors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;solid tumors&lt;/a&gt;, which is the 'holy grail' in the immuno-oncology field."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chimeric+antigen+receptor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chimeric antigen receptor&lt;/a&gt; (CAR) T therapy, use the body's white blood cells to attack cancer. They have largely worked only for blood cancers, such as leukemia. The GlyTR technology also proved effective in targeting leukemia, the study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Unorthodox approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many cancer researchers have sought protein biomarkers for specific cancers, Demetriou and Zhou aimed at a more abundant target, the unique coating of glycans that surround cancer cells but are found in very low density in normal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complex sugar chains are the most widespread cancer antigens known but were generally ignored by researchers because they are inert to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, Demetriou and Zhou engineered the GlyTR compounds to attach themselves, Velcro-like, to glycan-dense cancer cells while ignoring low-glycan-density normal cells. Once attached, the GlyTR compounds identify the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; as targets for killing by the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, current cancer immunotherapies attack cells based on specific proteins regardless of their glycan density and thereby fail to distinguish tumor cells from healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second impediment to developing broadly active cancer immunotherapies is the shield glycans form around solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By targeting glycans and blanketing the tumor cells with the Velcro-like compounds, the GlyTR technology overcomes both obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Human trials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step will be testing the therapy's safety and effectiveness in humans. Clinical grade GlyTR1 protein manufacturing is already being developed at the NCI Experimental Therapeutics program labs in Maryland, Demetriou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will enable the launch of a phase 1 clinical trial, which could begin within about two years. It will test the therapy in patients with a range of metastatic solid cancers. The highest glycan density is typically seen in patients with refractory/metastatic disease, a population that also has the greatest unmet need for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the revolutionary approach to cancer treatment our patients have been waiting for," said Farshid Dayyani, MD, Ph.D., medical director of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+center/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer center&lt;/a&gt;'s Stern Center for Clinical Trials and Research. "We are committing all available resources to bring this exciting new trial to UCI Health as fast as possible."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published by Duke University researchers has found a strong link between higher stress in children and adverse health conditions for them later in life. Appearing in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508549122" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; used measurable metrics of health over time to create a more quantitative view of how stress early in life affects health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"We've had an idea for a long time, since the '80s at least, that when children have adversity in their lives, it affects how their bodies work, not just psychologically, but also physiologically. It gets underneath the skin, and it becomes embodied in the way your body handles stress," said co-author Herman Pontzer, Duke professor of evolutionary anthropology and global health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/allostatic+load/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;allostatic load&lt;/a&gt; (AL), which refers to the wear and tear on the body because of chronic stress. The researchers "tested associations between childhood AL and adult cardiometabolic health," relying on biomarkers that included antibodies of C-reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation in the body; and the Epstein-Barr virus, which is common and highly contagious; body mass index; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis by lead author Elena Hinz, a Ph.D. student in the Pontzer Lab at Duke, showed that a child's stress levels, in children as young as 9 to 11 years old, is an indicator of their cardio and metabolic health in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, researchers ask adults to remember their stress. Hinz and her fellow researchers used a big study that collected quantitative—not just qualitative—samples over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper's authors reviewed data from the Great Smoky Mountains Study (GSMS), a longitudinal study of child &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychiatric+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; that began in 1992—and continues today—to determine the need for mental health services.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Hinz, who grew up in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rural+community/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rural community&lt;/a&gt; in East Tennessee, said her own coming-of-age experiences spurred her interest in childhood stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm from the rural South and kind of have this idea of what stress looks like in that environment, in terms of childhood adversity and dietary stress and the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+environment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical environment&lt;/a&gt; that kids are in," said Hinz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hinz said humans combat acute stress through a fight or flight response: "Your body collectively reacts by increasing your heart rate and blood pressure when you are experiencing a stressful situation," she explained. "Those and other responses help you deal with that stress, but it's not good to always be in that state. I'm interested in what happens when that doesn't really subside."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poverty is at the crux of the study, which indicates a stable, financially secure home is essential for a healthy childhood free of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Children, eight, nine and ten years old—what's happening to them seems to be predictive of blood pressure," said Pontzer about early life stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What helps is education and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/job+training/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;job training&lt;/a&gt; and all of the stuff that gets communities out of poverty. That gets people the help they need when they need it, as opposed to health care cost barriers. Making sure that a kid knows there's going to be dinner and food on the table because that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychological+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychological stress&lt;/a&gt; isn't just psychological," said Pontzer.

   &lt;p&gt;For the first time, a United Nations declaration is pledging to address dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly in New York are laying out a new plan for combatting mental health challenges and non-communicable diseases. While their &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2025/09/25/default-calendar/fourth-high-level-meeting-of-the-un-general-assembly-on-the-prevention-and-control-of-ncds-and-the-promotion-of-mental-health-and-wellbeing-(hlm4)" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;political declaration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes, it also mentions neurological conditions like dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's historical for us. It's a real watershed moment," says &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about-us/meet-the-team/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paola Barbarino&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of Alzheimer's Disease International, the advocacy group with members in 105 countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She said the inclusion of dementia is particularly significant for lower-income countries, many of which are still in "denial" about the condition.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Even in high-income countries where dementia gets attention, like the U.S., it has been a struggle to bring about the behavioral changes and medical interventions — such as weight loss and better blood pressure control — that could delay the onset of the condition. And, for many families dealing with dementia, finding adequate care and support is far from easy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the World Health Organization did put forward a &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/server/api/core/bitstreams/2098e5be-c7f3-4365-aebf-36204459794f/content" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global action plan on dementia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, which was extended earlier this year, Barbarino says, dementia is often missing or minimized in major policies, frameworks and discussions about non-communicable diseases. For example, WHO's 2022 report &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240057661" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Invisible Numbers: The True Extent of Non-communicable Diseases and What To Do About Them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; didn't mention it. And in 2011 the U.N. did mention Alzheimer's disease in a declaration but did not make specific commitments to address dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO emailed this statement to NPR on Thursday: "The &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/pga/wp-content/uploads/sites/109/2025/09/Finalized-PD-on-NCDs-and-Mental-Health-REV4-3-September-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 declaration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; marks a significant milestone by recognizing the global impact of dementia and committing to scale up access to services for the 57 million people living with the condition worldwide." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR caught up with Barbarino — who has spent years as an activist and advocate — while she was in New York for the U.N. General Assembly to talk about the significance of this moment and what comes next. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dementia is one of the biggest health and care challenges of our time. And it's set to grow a lot in prevalence as the population gets older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Just to give you an idea, last week, Australia declared dementia to be the leading cause of death. It is already among the biggest causes of death in the U.K., in the Netherlands, in Finland — in a lot more countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So it's actually extraordinary that it wasn't already included [in a U.N. declaration]. But this was not out of spite. It's simply because the stigma around dementia was so fierce that in the 1980s — when there was a movement for the other non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, respiratory disease — nobody was speaking about dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did it take for dementia to be included?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It has been probably two years of very serious work. We knew it was a problem beforehand but only recently did we realize that non-communicable disease mortality data [&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/probability-of-dying-between-exact-ages-30-and-70-from-any-of-cardiovascular-disease-cancer-diabetes-or-chronic-respiratory-(-)" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;published by the World Health Organization&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; often] focused on people below 70 years of age and not those above 70 years of age. Now, considering people are dying later, we cannot possibly not consider those last 20-some years of [life]. And it's in those 20 years, it's most likely that people will develop dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So we spent time collecting the data, doing evidence-based research. We published an article in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-024-01051-w#:~:text=Dementia%20is%20a%20neglected%20noncommunicable%20disease%20and%20leading%20cause%20of%20death,-Lewis%20Arthurton%20ORCID&amp;amp;text=Dementia%20is%20largely%20excluded%20from,effects%20are%20set%20to%20increase." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Review Neurology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in January. Dementia is expected to be the third leading cause of death globally in 2040. And people have listened.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this declaration mean for countries?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So, for high-income countries, a lot of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;risk reduction factors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for dementia [like anti-smoking efforts and campaigns to increase physical activity] are the same as those for other major diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease. So governments can embrace this agenda a lot more solidly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A lot of low-income countries are still in denial about the fact that dementia is a big problem in their country. That stems from the fact that, in part, they consider themselves young countries, with more young people than old people. They're just not used to thinking about what's going to happen to the older population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often, when our members [in lower-income countries] ask for their government to have risk reduction campaigns, they are told that dementia is not a big condition in the country. Sadly, that [kind of denial] means people living with dementia are not receiving the care and support that they deserve. Same with caregivers. So this is a massive issue that is not going to go away.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The other thing that is changing is that in low-income countries, just as in high-income countries, there used to be a great reliance on family carers and often older people are now alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What difference can a U.N. declaration make on the ground for families dealing with dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We have reports from all over the world of people in distress, in angst, with massive mental health issues [because they or their family member has dementia]. And it is difficult if you are alone facing this. And if the community around them doesn't know what's happening, they can exclude you rather than include you, and that can become an extra burden. In our survey last year, we found out that a lot of carers — about 33% — stopped doing any social activity after a diagnosis, because they're ashamed and they don't know how to communicate [about dementia].&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even at the highest level of government, dementia has so far been excluded. This U.N. declaration, for us, is really important because people now will be able to say: 'No, no. We are a major non- communicable disease.'&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But it's just one step and I am under no illusions. Getting [a dementia action plan] implemented country by country is going to take years — decades, maybe even.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does that look like for lower-income countries, especially where health budgets are already tight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;[In some higher-income countries, there are medications on the market that aim to help] but, right now, we are aware that that's not possible [in many lower-income countries].&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In some countries, the infrastructure and regulatory approval is not there. The testing and diagnostic capacity are not there. Even the medical professionals — the psychiatrist, the neurologist, the geriatricians — are not there. And some of the treatments currently available are very expensive. Some countries can simply not afford them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it's not just medications that matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We were particularly keen for people to understand that you can live a better life if you can have better care. Many families report that once they get a diagnosis, they are left absolutely alone with no information whatsoever. But there can be basic helplines, basic support groups.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is only so much that civil society can do. This is about the government being conscious of the fact that this is a societal challenge. They have to embrace it just the way they've embraced other conditions, like cancer or heart disease. And ask questions like: How can it be integrated in our health care system? How much money can go towards it?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, as [with] everything that has to do with the U.N. it could remain just as a piece of paper. We need to make sure that there is implementation, that governments put in place public health campaigns that include dementia. We will do a lot of work to make sure that this becomes tangible for the people that live with dementia and for their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in vision are often a common sign of aging. But what if we could reverse age-related visual decline? In a new study, UC Irvine researchers explore a possible therapy for addressing "aging" in the eye and for preventing diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"We show the potential for reversing age-related vision loss," says Dorota Skowronska-Krawczyk, Ph.D., an associate professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics and the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences. The study was a collaboration between researchers from UC Irvine, the Polish Academy of Sciences, and the Health and Medical University in Potsdam, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They outline their findings in "Retinal polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reverses aging-related vision decline in mice," a paper &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ads5769" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the aging gene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is a follow-up to an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-01-gene-functional-role-aging-eye.html"&gt;earlier study&lt;/a&gt; on Elongation of Very Long Chain Fatty Acids Protein 2 (ELOVL2), an established biomarker of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We showed that we have lower vision when this ELOVL2 enzyme isn't active," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, also a faculty member at the Robert M. Brunson Center for Translational Vision Research at the UC Irvine School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that work, the researchers found that enhancing ELOVL2 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; in aging mice boosted levels of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the eye and improved vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more recent study sought to identify a way to bypass the need for the ELOVL2 enzyme.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;As we age, changes in lipid metabolism lead to a decline in very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) in the retina, which in turn affects our vision and can lead to AMD. The ELOVL2 gene is a key enzyme in the production of VLC-PUFAs as well as DHA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Injecting aged mice with the polyunsaturated fatty acid improved visual function. "It's a proof-of-concept for turning lipid injection into a possible therapy," says Skowronska-Krawczyk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is important is that we didn't see the same effect with DHA." Others have also questioned the ability of DHA to slow AMD progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work really confirms the fact that DHA alone cannot do the work, but we have this other fatty acid that is seemingly working and improving vision in aged animals," says Skowronska-Krawczyk. "We have also shown on a molecular level that it actually reverses the aging features."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers found genetic variants in the ELOVL2 enzyme that correlate with faster progression of AMD. "Now we actually have a genetic connection to the disease and its aging aspect," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "so we could potentially identify people at higher risk for vision loss progression." This could lead to not only therapeutic treatment options but also targeted interventions for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings have only further solidified Skowronska-Krawczyk's view of the importance of the ELOVL2 enzyme. "I am pretty convinced it's one of the top aging genes that we should look at when we think about anti-aging therapies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking beyond the retina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a collaboration with researchers from UC San Diego, Skowronska-Krawczyk has also started to explore the role of lipid metabolism in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-key-enzyme-lipid-metabolism-linked.html"&gt;immune system aging&lt;/a&gt;. That study found that the lack of ELOVL2 enzyme induces accelerated aging of immune cells, suggesting that systemic lipid supplementation could potentially counteract the effects of age on the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt;. It also suggested that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lipid+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lipid metabolism&lt;/a&gt; might play a role in blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our first study explored a potential therapy to address &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vision/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; loss," says Skowronska-Krawczyk, "but with the information we've since learned about immune aging, we are hopeful the supplementation therapy will boost the immune system as well."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Maria Branyas Morera &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/maria-branyas-morera-worlds-oldest-living-person-spain-dies-117/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;died last year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at 117 years and 168 days old, she was the oldest known person in the world. Before she died, she asked doctors to study her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manel Esteller, chairman of Genetics at the University of Barcelona's School of Medicine, spent three years analyzing Branyas' health. A &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published online Wednesday, by Esteller and a cohort of colleagues found that a mix of factors contributed to Branyas' longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The conclusion is that the clues for extreme longevity are a mix between what we inherited from our parents and what we do in our lives," Esteller said. "And this mix, the percentage depends, but it can be ... half and half."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas "had very good genes that protect against many disorders, many genetic variants that nobody has seen before," Esteller said. She also had "very good habits." She didn't smoke or drink alcohol, and had a diet rich in fish, olive oil and yogurt — eating three yogurts each day, according to Esteller.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yogurt was plain without added sugar, which replenishes the gut with good bacteria, helping to combat inflammation, Esteller said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of aging and disease, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are good bacteria that provide an advantage to humans," Esteller added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study noted that "whether the dominance of the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; [beneficial gut bacteria] related genus is fully attributable or not to the yogurt diet cannot be completely confirmed since that would have required a longitudinal study with sample collection over several years. However, we believe that it is likely that a beneficial effect of yogurt ingestion via modulation of the gut ecosystem could have contributed to her well-being and advanced age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branyas once &lt;a href="https://x.com/MariaBranyas112/status/1601512836932390914/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; about her love for yogurt, saying it "gives life" — and hers was a long one. She was born in 1907 in San Francisco and had lived in Spain since she was 8. She survived two world wars and two pandemics, and had three children and 13 great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to living a long life, she also lived a healthy one — free of cancer, cardiovascular disease or dementia, according to Esteller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The picture that emerges from studying Branyas "shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level," the study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Cell Reports Medicine,&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that to conduct the study, "samples from the subject were obtained from four different sources: total peripheral blood, saliva, urine, and stool at different times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also noted some limitations, including that aging and extreme longevity "are probably highly individualized processes," so "drawing broadly applicable conclusions from a single subject should be taken with caution." &lt;/p&gt;

The condition is typically asymptomatic, and people may live with it for years without knowing, until it turns into full-blown diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with prediabetes, doctors recommend foods that cause a slow, steady rise in blood sugar rather than a rapid spike, including whole, unprocessed foods over packaged and sugary items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a new study is turning that advice on its head, with scientists concluding that high-sugar fruits may actually be the key to reversing prediabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tropical fruits contain between 10 to 50 grams of sugar, making them foods that people concerned about blood glucose &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14584073/artificial-ingredients-food-drinks-organ-working-properly.html"&gt;try to avoid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But clinical nutrition researcher Raedeh Basiri said that mangos, despite having high levels of natural sugar, may offer protective factors for adults with prediabetes. People in the latest study who ate a daily mango showed improved blood glucose control, enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mango also contains a wealth of vitamins, including A, C, B6 and E, plus key minerals like potassium and copper and more than five grams of fiber, a key nutrient that slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. This prevents rapid spikes in blood glucose, which can, over time, cause type 2 diabetes, suffered by 37million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sugar content is not the only factor in picking the right foods. Fiber and vitamin content &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14775847/Doctors-plant-diet-heart-disease-Type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;are just as important&lt;/a&gt;, and Basiri said in a statement: ‘Individuals at high risk of diabetes should not only focus on the sugar content of foods, but on how sugars are delivered.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Though tropical fruits are often avoided for their sugar, researcher Raedeh Basiri suggests mangoes could have protective factors for those with prediabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri conducted the first long-term clinical trial to show the tropical fruit’s positive effects on metabolism and lean body mass, despite its high sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Florida, Nevada and Virginia recruited 24 adults aged 50 to 70 with prediabetes. They were screened to exclude factors that could skew the results, such as existing diabetes, specific diets, or being a frequent mango eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then randomly assigned to one of two groups for 24 weeks. One group ate 300 grams of fresh mango, equivalent to one whole fruit, with about 32 grams of sugar daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control ate a granola bar with about 11 grams of sugar and the same number of calories every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the beginning of the study and at weeks six, 12 and 24, the researchers measured blood sugar and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured people's body fat percentage, the total weight of everything in their body that is not fat and the total amount of water contained within their body. They kept track of people’s body weight, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study tracked their daily intake of either mango or granola bars. The data were then analyzed to compare the changes over time between the two groups, controlling for baseline differences in characteristics such as sex and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data revealed compelling evidence for the benefits of daily mango consumption in adults with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

The condition is typically asymptomatic, and people may live with it for years without knowing, until it turns into full-blown diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with prediabetes, doctors recommend foods that cause a slow, steady rise in blood sugar rather than a rapid spike, including whole, unprocessed foods over packaged and sugary items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a new study is turning that advice on its head, with scientists concluding that high-sugar fruits may actually be the key to reversing prediabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tropical fruits contain between 10 to 50 grams of sugar, making them foods that people concerned about blood glucose &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14584073/artificial-ingredients-food-drinks-organ-working-properly.html"&gt;try to avoid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But clinical nutrition researcher Raedeh Basiri said that mangos, despite having high levels of natural sugar, may offer protective factors for adults with prediabetes. People in the latest study who ate a daily mango showed improved blood glucose control, enhanced insulin sensitivity and reduced body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mango also contains a wealth of vitamins, including A, C, B6 and E, plus key minerals like potassium and copper and more than five grams of fiber, a key nutrient that slows the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream. This prevents rapid spikes in blood glucose, which can, over time, cause type 2 diabetes, suffered by 37million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sugar content is not the only factor in picking the right foods. Fiber and vitamin content &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14775847/Doctors-plant-diet-heart-disease-Type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;are just as important&lt;/a&gt;, and Basiri said in a statement: ‘Individuals at high risk of diabetes should not only focus on the sugar content of foods, but on how sugars are delivered.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Though tropical fruits are often avoided for their sugar, researcher Raedeh Basiri suggests mangoes could have protective factors for those with prediabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Basiri conducted the first long-term clinical trial to show the tropical fruit’s positive effects on metabolism and lean body mass, despite its high sugar content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Florida, Nevada and Virginia recruited 24 adults aged 50 to 70 with prediabetes. They were screened to exclude factors that could skew the results, such as existing diabetes, specific diets, or being a frequent mango eater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were then randomly assigned to one of two groups for 24 weeks. One group ate 300 grams of fresh mango, equivalent to one whole fruit, with about 32 grams of sugar daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control ate a granola bar with about 11 grams of sugar and the same number of calories every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the beginning of the study and at weeks six, 12 and 24, the researchers measured blood sugar and insulin levels, insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also measured people's body fat percentage, the total weight of everything in their body that is not fat and the total amount of water contained within their body. They kept track of people’s body weight, BMI and waist-to-hip ratio as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study tracked their daily intake of either mango or granola bars. The data were then analyzed to compare the changes over time between the two groups, controlling for baseline differences in characteristics such as sex and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The data revealed compelling evidence for the benefits of daily mango consumption in adults with prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="15133407" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15133407/fruit-reverse-diabetes-mango-sugar-fiber.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpusl6000l3b79wqpkznjl@published"&gt;My parents were scheduled to take the kids on Saturday morning and have them back by dinnertime while Mia and I attended the bar mitzvah of a friend’s son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzq5g35001j3b79uqa0bppv@published"&gt;When we got back in the late afternoon, we received a text with pics of my parents and our kids at a famous aquarium—one that is a plane-ride away from our home! Apparently my parents decided to surprise the boys. They had the trip in the works since we asked them to watch the boys—&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; clearing it with my wife and me.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpusmz000m3b79t2q589y5@published"&gt;Once we saw the pictures, Mia called them, incensed, and demanded they return with the kids immediately. My parents said they’d be back Sunday evening, and then pretended their battery was dying and ended the call. We didn’t hear from them again until they were ready to board the plane the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

While I realize my parents should have consulted us about going on the trip with the kids, I really think this is an overreaction. The kids had the time of their lives. Neither of them have any medical issues that would preclude a spur of the moment trip, and my parents are two caring, responsible adults. How can I convince my wife that going nuclear is not the answer?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzput1g000p3b799p9oykp9@published"&gt;I mean, first I wouldn’t accuse her of “going nuclear”? I get why she’s mad, and also why whatever faith she might have had in your parents has been shaken.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputck000q3b79qv4xuql5@published"&gt;Let’s review the facts: Your parents took your children on a flight and an overnight trip without your knowledge or consent. And then, when they were told to bring the kids back that same day, they refused, made up a lie about their phone battery, and presumably didn’t contact or take any further calls from you, &lt;em&gt;your children’s parents&lt;/em&gt;, until they were about to fly home the next day. To top it off, it sounds like they have not apologized and don’t believe they did anything wrong…which means they would probably feel justified in doing something like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputf0000r3b79mta1lg04@published"&gt;Some people would say there’s a word for taking someone else’s children from home without their parents’ knowledge or permission, and then refusing to bring them back when they were told to! Of course I’m not saying that your parents had malicious intentions, or that your kids were ever in danger. Nor am I saying they need to be cut off forever. But when you kind of dismiss your wife’s anger by saying that your children had fun—I mean, that’s nice, I guess, but the amount of fun had by anyone is not even remotely the point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputo2000s3b79fr7klama@published"&gt;This incident has shown that you and your wife cannot trust your parents to 1) go through the (required and extremely basic!) process of informing you of what they plan to do with your &lt;em&gt;minor children &lt;/em&gt;and getting your permission to do things like keep them overnight or bring them on a flight somewhere, or 2) listen and actually do what you ask where your children are concerned. I see how those things would be dealbreakers for some, especially if this wasn’t a one-time thing, but just the latest and wildest way your parents have shown their disrespect for you, your wife, and your authority as parents. And it sounds like this &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; part of a larger pattern—you said yourself that your parents have a history of not respecting the boundaries you and Mia put in place.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzputr5000t3b797ksgjtpa@published"&gt;(I have just reread your letter and noted that your parents &lt;em&gt;were planning this all along&lt;/em&gt; and chose not to read you in. It was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a fun, spontaneous decision they made without telling you, which still would have been weird; they made their plan, bought the tickets, reserved a hotel, and then chose to deceive you about it every moment leading up to the trip. ABSOLUTELY WILD BEHAVIOR. Like, did they &lt;em&gt;both &lt;/em&gt;think this was normal? I’m actually kind of worried about them, if so.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuu4g000u3b79m7mbbd9b@published"&gt;Maybe your wife is saying that she doesn’t want your parents to have access to your kids because she really doesn’t feel like she can currently trust them. If you and Mia tell them to do X or don’t do Y with the kids, Mia doesn’t know whether they’ll listen. Maybe she’s really pissed and just doesn’t want to see them for a good long while—honestly, that makes sense to me, too.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmfzpuu8m000v3b79v6e3jk25@published"&gt;Instead of telling your wife that she’s overreacting, or trying to talk her out of how she feels, listen to what she’s saying and try to understand where she’s coming from. Acknowledge that what your parents did was unacceptable, and that Mia has a right to be upset. After that, perhaps the two of you can eventually get to a point where you can discuss ways your parents might see the kids, under conditions you both can live with (e.g.: visits at your house with at least one parent present, after a break/cooldown period, if your parents promise that nothing like this will never happen again?). Mia might really need some time before she can consider this, or see your parents herself, so try to respect that. The point is that it shouldn’t be you against your wife, or you and your parents against your wife. It should be you and Mia acknowledging what your parents did wrong, acknowledging the other person’s feelings, and trying to problem-solve together.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can’t even trust them to do what you ask regarding your kids or run things like &lt;em&gt;plane trips&lt;/em&gt; by you first, they can’t be your go-to caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;

During the 2024-25 flu season, 109 children were diagnosed with the rare complication, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/" target="_blank"&gt;new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fe378" class="body-graf"&gt;The finding comes as the nation logged &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/week-37.html" target="_blank"&gt;280 pediatric flu deaths last year&lt;/a&gt;, the deadliest ever aside from the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic, as well as falling rates of children vaccinated against influenza. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b2f39b" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t always know how to predict which kids are going to have the most severe forms of flu, which is why we recommend the vaccine for everyone,” said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. “It's a misnomer to think that only sickly kids get complications from the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-42e698" class="body-graf"&gt;ANE is rare — just a handful of cases each year — and has never been formally tracked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8e9697" class="body-graf"&gt;This year, however, doctors anecdotally noted an uptick in kids severely affected with brain inflammation after having the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-741fb3" class="body-graf"&gt;“We don’t know in real numbers if this is an increase, but I will tell you, being on the ground, being a physician who cares for these patients, I was certainly struck that this was an increase,” said Dr. Molly Wilson-Murphy, a pediatric neurologist at Boston Children’s Hospital. She is also an author of the new study published by the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-dea652" class="body-heading"&gt;Dangerous complications from the flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-93ffcb" class="body-graf"&gt;The 109 children tallied in the research were all diagnosed with influenza-associated encephalopathy, or IAE. It occurs when the influenza virus attacks the child’s nervous system. Kids can have a spectrum of symptoms: confusion, difficulty walking, hallucinations, abnormal movements and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e00b0" class="body-graf"&gt;Wilson-Murphy suspects there are at least seven forms of IAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d88c64" class="body-graf"&gt;ANE, Beckett’s illness, is one of them. ANE accounted for about a third of the overall IAE cases in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1dc51b" class="body-graf"&gt;Of the children with influenza-associated encephalopathy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-e8ca04" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;74% were admitted to the intensive care unit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;54% were put on a ventilator&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;55% were previously healthy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19% died&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5caad4" class="body-graf"&gt;“Flu is dangerous for children, period,” said Dr. Keith Van Haren, a co-author of the study and a pediatric neurologist at Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California. “That is not a mischaracterization.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-3bb699" class="body-heading"&gt;Childhood flu vaccine rates are falling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ec7bd5" class="body-graf"&gt;Seasonal flu shots are notoriously subpar when it comes to preventing flu infections, compared with more robust vaccines like the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbe579" class="body-graf"&gt;But doctors say the shot’s benefit lies in its ability to reduce the chance the infection will lead to severe complications and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-57bf40" class="body-graf"&gt;“Our goal as parents and doctors is to keep kids healthy and to help protect kids who are at risk from getting sicker,” Van Haren said. “Vaccination against the flu is the purest, best, simplest way to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-386e26" class="body-graf"&gt;Last year, the flu shot was found to be up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;78% effective&lt;/a&gt; in keeping kids and teens with the flu out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-01f7af" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the new report, 84% of kids with influenza-associated encephalopathy whose vaccination status was known weren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ded252" class="body-graf"&gt;And 90% of the 280 children who died last flu season hadn’t received their annual flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-579a03" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best way to protect yourself and your family from influenza is for everyone to get vaccinated,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary, an infectious diseases expert with the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9b60" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians generally recommend kids get their flu shots before the end of October. A peek at how the shot has been working so far in the Southern Hemisphere’s flu season shows the vaccine is cutting down on flu-related hospitalizations by half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b7c5b1" class="body-graf"&gt;But the percentage of kids getting their flu shots has been falling in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f76663" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the CDC, fewer than half of kids (49.2%) had their flu shot last year, down from 62.4% in the 2019-20 flu season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44beda" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Leary said that reasons for the decline are complex. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;Increasing vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt; is just one factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5465e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of families are experiencing access to care issues,” he said. “And a lot of practices are experiencing significant staffing issues. They might not be able to have large flu clinics after hours or on  Saturdays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ccb0f5" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;With rare exceptions, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 17:59:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxQX1hjNXp1MEpGUlM5Z2p0eEh5Zm5jM3Vpa1BidGpGZHkwdzRwMHVIam91UlU5bzRUVU9lenhwdVhZckpEMmhhTHJ4TExBRS05bXhqZjdvMlpfcVFTbFRoVVNvSlQyQ0NVN21wTURRcEl1OWZnXzc5ejlHN0dBNnc4TjhwSnI4T1JFcDYzV3d1bzIwTHRHTGl3Nkgwb0dFXzZF0gFWQVVfeXFMUEhQWnlSTHhyVXpRMmt4Q2pOWGZjeW5fQ1ZGODYwclRDUzhEbW9vMHAtdWJSZWduX2Jhd0dGUTV1QzBrdGptZURRc3lzb1EwQkJuNkZJbEE</guid></item><item><title>电子烟对牙齿和口腔健康有什么影响？ -卫报</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/25/impact-vaping-teeth-oral-health-decay</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QAndAExplainerBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-smoking-bad-for-teeth" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Is smoking bad for teeth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A hefty proportion of vapers are former smokers or smoke as well as vape, so the first port of call is the impact of smoking. Humans started smoking long before modern science and there is a wealth of robust evidence on its health effects. The message is clear: smoking is extremely damaging to oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond the bad breath, brown stains and loss of taste, tar and toxins in tobacco smoke increase the risk of gum disease. In severe cases, this can cause teeth to fall out. The disease can be harder to spot in smokers though, because nicotine reduces blood flow in the gums. This makes them less likely to bleed, which is one of the early warning signs of disease. Smokers may also struggle to overcome gum disease because of the continued onslaught of smoke and the effect smoking has on the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smoking causes more than a dozen types of cancer throughout the body and more than half of mouth cancers are linked to the habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-vaping" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about vaping?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The impact of vaping on teeth and oral health is still being thrashed out. Far fewer studies have looked at the issue and many that have are flawed. A common problem is that studies fail to ensure vapers are not smoking cigarettes as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The absolute effects of vapes and their impact on oral health are unknown,” a spokesperson for the British Dental Association said. But they added that recent, limited evidence did raise concerns over oral dryness, irritation and gum disease caused by vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-do-the-studies-say" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What do the studies say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers at Newcastle University published a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41432-025-01119-6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;major review&lt;/a&gt; this year into the impact of vaping on periodontal health, meaning the gums, ligaments and bone that supports our teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two markers of long-term disease are bone loss and pockets in the gum tissue around teeth, but there was no evidence these were any worse in vapers than in non-smokers or former smokers. The vapers did have slightly worse gum disease, “but it was pretty marginal”, said Dr Richard Holliday, a senior lecturer and honorary consultant in restorative dentistry at Newcastle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-tooth-decay" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about tooth decay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Again, the evidence is tentative, but there are some concerns. In &lt;a href="https://jada.ada.org/article/S0002-8177%2822%2900577-3/abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt;, US researchers analysed patient records for more than 13,000 people who attended dental clinics between 2019 and 2022. “Patients who vaped did show an increased risk of developing dental caries when compared to non-smoking and non-vaping patients,” Dr Karina Irusa, the study’s first author, told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Newcastle team also found higher levels of plaque in vapers compared with non-smokers or former smokers, which would be in keeping with a greater risk of dental caries. But more studies are needed to investigate whether vaping itself is to blame for tooth decay. There’s evidence that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5269575/#:~:text=Nicotine%20dependence%20was%20positively%20correlated,context%20of%20depression%20and%20stress." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;nicotine users eat more sugar&lt;/a&gt;, so vapers may have bad teeth for reasons other than their nicotine habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-might-vaping-cause-tooth-decay" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;How might vaping cause tooth decay?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A common claim is that sugar in flavoured vapes drives tooth decay, but manufacturers tend to use artificial sweeteners instead of sugar. This is because sugar burns at vape-operating temperatures, so using them would produce a burnt flavour and clog up the heating coil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If vaping does drive tooth decay, Holliday suspects that having a dry mouth, which vapers often mention, is part of the problem. “Saliva is a wonderful thing to protect your teeth. When you reduce that, tooth decay can happen more rapidly and gum disease can happen more rapidly, too,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Saliva helps to keep teeth clean and it also contains calcium and phosphate that help withstand acid attacks from bacteria, and from drinks such as fruit juices, which are the key drivers of tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;How vapes cause a dry mouth isn’t entirely clear, but vape liquids are the prime culprits. They are mostly propylene glycol and vegetable glycerol, which are hygroscopic, meaning they absorb and hold on to water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-about-cancer" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;What about cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People who vape do not inhale anything like the number and variety of carcinogens in cigarette smoke. For this reason, the risk appears low. But it is an area scientists are watching, because vapers are still regularly inhaling chemicals into their bodies and the long-term effects on the delicate tissue in the lungs and elsewhere are not yet known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-spacefinder-role="nested"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-1peeo35"&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-vaping-safe-for-young-people" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;Is vaping safe for young people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, summed it up like this: “If you smoke, vaping is much safer; if you don’t smoke, don’t vape.” According to Holliday, that is sound advice. “If you’re a young person, don’t vape,” he said. “You are putting something into a complicated ecosystem, so there will be risks from vaping long term. But compared to smoking, they’ll be minuscule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 16:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOb1NSUWp3SDUwQlNuTUF4bDZDTWphM0JvOHBPaTY5LXNiUkszQVdiTnI5YUZjTkFOdHFUX0cxazl1R1JpSDZ0cVpUU3VJNXB4NGlJR3ZJQXU1TTBqZ2RnNmsxbUFOai1tLWtqd1Qyc01CbnlLR2lQTEJVYXYzT1B3eVhaT0Y3X1pvWWtxcmR3</guid></item><item><title>首次使用基因疗法治疗亨廷顿舞蹈症-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03139-9</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03139-9/d41586-025-03139-9_51483506.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03139-9/d41586-025-03139-9_51483506.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="FLAIR MRI scan of the brain of a 21-old patient with Huntington's disease, showing atrophy of the cortex and caudate nuclei." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03139-9/d41586-025-03139-9_51483506.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;A brain scan of a person with Huntington’s disease, which causes a loss of brain volume as neurons are killed off by the accumulation of a mutant protein.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Zephyr/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A one-time &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00870-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00870-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; can markedly slow the progression of Huntington’s disease, potentially paving the way for the first ever treatment to alter the course of this rare, inherited brain disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small trial of 29 people who were in the early stages of Huntington’s-related decline, participants who received a high dose of the therapy directly into their brains saw the disease slow by 75% over three years, compared with those in a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00870-x" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03139-9/d41586-025-03139-9_19019654.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Genetic therapies offer new hope against incurable brain diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit was statistically significant across several clinical measures, according to &lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track="click" data-label="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;data released this week by uniQure&lt;/a&gt;, a gene-therapy company based in Amsterdam. Trial investigators also observed a reduction in the level of a toxic protein linked to neurodegeneration in the spinal fluid of people who received the therapy. On the strength of these findings, uniQure executives said they plan to seek regulatory approval for the treatment next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This gene therapy is obviously a big step forward,” says Sandra Kostyk, a neurologist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus, who was involved in the trial. “The data look quite good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slowing the disease’s advance could translate into many extra years of independence for people with Huntington’s, Kostyk says, but it is not a cure. And, with so few participants, the trial’s results — still unpublished — should be viewed as preliminary, she adds. “I think we need more time and more data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A deadly repeat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People living with Huntington’s disease typically see their symptoms progress year by year, usually starting between the ages of 35 and 55. What often begins as a subtle loss of coordination or forgetfulness then often progresses to involuntary movements, sharp mood swings and a gradual unravelling of memory and thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by excessive DNA repeats in a gene called huntingtin, which leads to the production of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00119-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00119-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;faulty protein that slowly poisons the brain&lt;/a&gt;. There are currently no therapies that address this root cause, so those who inherit the mutation are left only with drugs that ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the first attempts to develop a treatment focused on &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0452-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0452-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;antisense therapy&lt;/a&gt;, a gene-targeted strategy that uses short strands of DNA or RNA to dial down production of the defective huntingtin protein. The approach showed promise in early clinical development&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01177-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;hopes dimmed in 2021&lt;/a&gt; after a leading candidate failed in late-stage testing, with those receiving the therapy seeming to fare worse than those who were given a placebo&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This clinical setback redirected attention towards a different strategy: gene therapy, which aims to provide a one-time intervention that permanently silences or modifies the deficient gene at its source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Molecular muzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of uniQure’s gene therapy, the treatment uses a harmless virus to deliver the recipe for making a short RNA sequence known as a microRNA directly into cells in the affected parts of the brain. The microRNA is designed to ‘muzzle’ the defective huntingtin gene — and stop the cells producing the faulty protein — by blocking the molecular instructions encoded by the gene, known as mRNA. Once delivered, the virus-encoded instructions stay inside the cells, which continue to produce the therapeutic microRNA. The discovery of microRNAs was feted with a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03212-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03212-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Nobel Prize last year&lt;/a&gt;, although the technology &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03303-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03303-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;has yet to yield any approved medicines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administering the treatment requires a lengthy surgery in which clinicians use magnetic resonance imaging to precisely place a cannula through small holes in the skull. The therapy is then infused slowly into the striatum, a part of the brain that is among the first and hardest hit by Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers followed adults, many with chronic pain, and found that optimism, restorative sleep, social connections, and stress management strongly protected against accelerated brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MRI scans revealed that participants with the most protective factors had brains up to eight years younger than expected. These results suggest that lifestyle habits can measurably slow brain aging and strengthen resilience even in vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Age Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; A measure comparing MRI-based “brain age” to real age shows lifestyle impacts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Good sleep, optimism, stress management, and social support slowed brain aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measurable Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; Brains looked up to 8 years younger in participants with healthy habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;University of Florida&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y&lt;strong&gt;our chronological age may say 65, but your brain could be acting a decade younger — or older — depending on your  life experiences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the message from a new study by University of Florida researchers, who found that optimism, good sleep, social support and other positive factors were strongly linked with healthier brains. The findings suggest that how people live and cope with stress can measurably influence the pace of brain aging, even in those living with chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are things that people have some level of control over,” said Jared Tanner, Ph.D., a research associate professor of clinical and health psychology at the University of Florida who helped lead the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can learn how to perceive stress differently. Poor sleep is very treatable. Optimism can be practiced.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research followed 128 middle-aged and older adults, most with chronic musculoskeletal pain associated with or at risk of knee osteoarthritis, for two years. Using MRI scans analyzed by a machine learning system, the team estimated each participant’s “brain age” and compared it to their actual chronological age. This brain age gap between the two served as a measure of whole-brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stressful factors like chronic pain, low income, less education and other social risks were associated with older-looking brains. Those links seemed to make less of an impression over time. What stood out more clearly were protective elements: things like getting restorative sleep, maintaining a healthy weight, managing stress, avoiding tobacco and having supportive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who reported the most protective factors had brains eight years younger than their chronological age when the study started, and their brains went on to age more slowly over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The message is consistent across our studies,  health promoting behaviors are not only associated with lower pain and better physical functioning, they appear to actually bolster health in an additive fashion at a meaningful level,” said Kimberly Sibille, Ph.D., an associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at UF and senior author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sibille and Tanner, along with colleagues across UF and at other institutions, published their findings Sept. 11 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that older brains are more vulnerable to problems like memory loss, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Traditionally, brain research has focused on individual regions. But since pain, stress and life experiences affect many parts of the brain at once, the brain age gap — the difference between a person’s age and how old their brain looks in brain scans — provides a single, whole-brain snapshot that captures those complexities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study focused on people living with chronic pain, it’s likely that factors like lower stress, social support and quality sleep serve to slow brain aging in other populations as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Literally for every additional healthy promoting factor there is some evidence of neurobiological benefit,” Sibille said. “Our findings support the growing body of evidence that Lifestyle is medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b2e39222865232a2622273f24250b3e2d27652e2f3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ufl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eric Hamilton – University of Florida&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;More than chronic pain: behavioral and psychosocial protective factors predict lower brain age in adults with/at risk for knee osteoarthritis over two years&lt;/a&gt;” by Jared Tanner et al. &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than chronic pain: behavioral and psychosocial protective factors predict lower brain age in adults with/at risk for knee osteoarthritis over two years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interplay between chronic musculoskeletal pain and brain aging is complex. Studies employing machine learning models to assess relationships between brain age and chronic pain generally show higher chronic pain severity associates with older brain age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses to date have not considered individual and community level socioenvironmental risk factors or behavioral/psychosocial protective factors as potential modifiers of cross-sectional and longitudinal brain age. This study aimed to elucidate the relationships between chronic pain, socioenvironmental risk, behavioral/psychosocial protective factors, and brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample comprised 197 adults (Men:Women = 68:129) from a prospective observational cohort study. Most individuals reported knee pain and were with/at risk for osteoarthritis. A subset of 128 participants (Men:Women = 41:87) completed a follow-up MRI session at two years and were included in the longitudinal analysis (Aim 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were 45–85 years of age and self-identified as non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White. Data collected included demographics, health history, pain assessments, individual and community-level socioenvironmental factors (education, income, household size, marital and insurance status, and area deprivation index) coded as a summative socioenvironmental risk variable, and behavioral/psychosocial factors (tobacco use, waist circumference, optimism, positive and negative affect, perceived stress, perceived social support, sleep) coded as a summative behavioral/psychosocial protective factor variable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural MRI data was used to estimate brain age applying a machine learning approach (DeepBrainNet). Cross-sectional analyses utilized regression and analysis of variance, while longitudinal analyses utilized a linear mixed model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher chronic pain stage and socioenvironmental risk associated with an increased brain age gap (the difference between chronological age and predicted brain age). Participants who had higher socioenvironmental risk had brains that were about three years older than participants with lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having more behavioral/psychosocial protective factors correlated with a lower brain age gap; participants with higher behavioral/psychosocial protective factors had brains that were over three years younger than participants with fewer behavioral/psychosocial protective factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinally, higher baseline behavioral/psychosocial protective factors associated with lower brain age over the two-year span, beyond the effects of chronic pain stage and socioenvironmental risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show behavioral/psychosocial protective factors may counteract neurobiological aging and help buffer the brain from chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 16:18:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBuNkgxdVFSaWlfUHJORjNpTzcwQjl4a2thc0wzTDQ2QkFGZGxUX25jSkhtQjMxX0lnai1MQ1pYWWt5NlV2SW82TmxhbVRYTUQ4LUhnNi0wZnRGY1ZpdkdqTGNiZkJUZGM0</guid></item><item><title>如何通过更换包装和厨房用具来减少食品中的微塑料- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/how-to-reduce-microplastics-in-food-by-changing-packaging-and-kitchen-utensils/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study shows that normal use of plastic packaging and kitchen gear can shed tiny particles into what we eat and drink. It maps the science and suggests practical ways to cut everyday exposure to these microplastics from our food without turning daily routines upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reviewed evidence across many product types and everyday actions, from twisting open a cap to steeping a tea bag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also launched an open dashboard that lets anyone explore where particles show up and how tests were done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-in-food-packaging"&gt;Microplastics in food packaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Lisa Zimmermann, from the &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food Packaging Forum&lt;/a&gt; in Zurich led the work. She was joined by collaborators from &lt;a href="https://www.eawag.ch/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eawag&lt;/a&gt; in Switzerland and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NTNU&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed 103 studies and found that most reported plastic particles (microplastics or nanoplastics – MNPs) in foods or test liquids that had touched packaging or tools made with plastic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also logged which test methods were used and how carefully the studies controlled for contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only seven of the 103 studies met the highest reliability bar for answering the core question about particle release under normal use conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one third used a kinetic design, for example, measuring how particle levels change with time, temperature, or repeated use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first systematic evidence map to investigate the role of the normal and intended use of food contact articles in the contamination of foodstuffs with MNPs,” explained Dr. Zimmermann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-microplastics-get-into-food"&gt;How microplastics get into food&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists use the term microplastics for plastic particles roughly 1 to 1000 micrometers in size. Even smaller pieces are nanoplastics, which are below 1 micrometer and can be harder to detect with current methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The items that touch food are called food contact articles, and they include &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;bottles&lt;/a&gt;, caps, pouches, wraps, cartons with plastic liners, tea bags, cutting boards, utensils, and parts of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/common-plastic-food-packaging-contains-9936-harmful-chemicals/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; processing machines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these materials are polymers. These long, chain molecules can shed fragments when stressed by heat, abrasion, or repeated use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61146-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; measured particle release during typical steps used to open packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that everyday actions like tearing a bag, scissoring a wrapper, or twisting a cap can generate plastic fragments. Heat and time can add to the stress, so hotter food contact and longer storage often matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-packaging-swaps-that-cut-microplastic-exposure"&gt;Packaging swaps that cut microplastic exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polymer tea bags are an easy place to start. A single plastic tea bag, steeped around 203 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius), released about 11.6 billion microplastic and 3.1 billion nanoplastic particles in one cup, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31552738/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose loose leaf tea with a stainless steel infuser or paper tea bags that are not sealed with plastic. If you do use bagged tea, avoid squeezing the bag or stirring it hard because added agitation can increase wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store drinks and sauces in glass or stainless steel when you can, and keep &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/agricultural-soil-is-now-the-worlds-biggest-plastic-dumping-ground/"&gt;plastic&lt;/a&gt; contact time short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you open a bottled drink, pour it into a glass rather than sipping and re capping many times. This will reduce friction at the threads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look for packaging that minimizes plastic on parts that rub, such as caps, spouts, and seals. Simpler closures with fewer plastic-on-plastic contact points are generally better for abrasion control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smarter-utensils-and-kitchen-habits"&gt;Smarter utensils and kitchen habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting boards deserve attention because knives grind directly into the surface. Plastic &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19440049.2021.2017002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cutting boards&lt;/a&gt; have been traced as the source of polyethylene fragments found in retail meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swap plastic boards for wooden or glass models for most chopping tasks. If you keep plastic boards for raw meat handling, replace them when deep grooves appear and avoid heavy scraping that chews up the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use utensils that do not gouge soft plastics. Metal tips on soft plastic containers can scrape particles, so choose wooden or silicone tools for stirring inside plastic tubs, and preferably mix in glass or stainless steel bowls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid heating food in disposable plastic containers. Move leftovers into glass or ceramic before reheating so the hottest temperatures do not hit plastic parts that can wear under heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-health-and-microplastics"&gt;Food, health, and microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is rapidly evolving on what these particles do in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; followed surgical patients who had some of their tissues analyzed for microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that patients with microplastics in plaque that was removed from neck arteries had a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. They were followed over roughly 34 months, in the time following the analysis of their tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That result does not prove cause and effect, but it raises fair questions about reducing avoidable exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new evidence map also stresses that better methods and consistent reporting are needed so scientists and regulators can compare results across labs with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy steps are on the table. The authors argue that regulators can require tests of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com//news/most-energetic-neutrino-ever-detected-captured-at-km3net-mediterranean-sea/"&gt;particle&lt;/a&gt; migration from packaging and tools under real-use conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could include investigations of the effects of time, temperature, and repeated use cycles. Harmonized testing would help industry design safer products and help shoppers make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are simple changes you can make today.

			&lt;p&gt;Find yourself prone to anxiety? The roots of the condition could stretch back to before you were even born, according to a new study in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine in the US have found that infection or stress in a mother &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pregnancy-ages-a-persons-cells-but-some-may-undergo-an-unexpected-rejuvenation"&gt;during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; could increase the risk of the offspring developing anxiety as an adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000000916"&gt;shown links&lt;/a&gt; between prenatal health problems and mental health issues later in life, including anxiety. In this latest investigation, researchers took a close look at potential neurological mechanisms that could be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-anxiety-in-young-womens-brains-may-have-been-found"&gt;The Secret to Anxiety in Young Women's Brains May Have Been Found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team genetically engineered mice in a way that simulates extra inflammation that a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/profound-brain-changes-of-pregnancy-revealed-in-scientific-first"&gt;pregnant mother&lt;/a&gt; might experience under stressful conditions. Then, they carefully monitored the offspring produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on male offspring, who have more pronounced anxiety behaviors than females. These offspring were also genetically "normal", meaning they didn't inherit the predisposition for stress and inflammation from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, as adults, these offspring still showed telltale signs of anxiety, such as avoiding open spaces. What's more, scans indicated that a small number of brain cells in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentate_gyrus"&gt;ventral dentate gyrus&lt;/a&gt; (vDG), which helps assess potential threats in the surrounding environment, were working overtime when the animals felt threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our data reveal prenatal adversity left lasting imprints on the neurons of the vDG, linking gestational environment to anxiety-like behavior," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropharmacologist Miklos Toth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This mechanism may help explain the persistent stress sensitivity and avoidance seen in some individuals with innate anxiety."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174946" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety.jpg" alt="Mouse pregnancy study" class="wp-image-174946 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MouseAnxiety-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174946" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mice exposed to stress in the womb were shown to be more anxious as adults. (Nabila et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to look at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of the mice, a chemical tagging system that controls whether specific genes are turned on or off. These on-off switches were modified at thousands of sites along DNA strands collected from the vDG, especially in gene regions that control neuron communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice felt they were under threat, it was in these reprogrammed areas where the neurons were working the hardest. It seems as though the mouse brains are coded to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-figuring-out-if-its-anxiety-adhd-or-both-matters"&gt;more anxious&lt;/a&gt; about potential threats, and more eager to avoid them, even before the threat has actually appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, these  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="174943" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt; are instructing certain neurons in the vDG to respond differently in adulthood when faced with unsafe environments," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuropharmacologist Kristen Pleil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The neurons show too much activity, ultimately contributing to the mice perceiving the environment as more threatening than it actually is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety is one of the more common mental health problems, and is thought to affect &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2010.05.017"&gt;almost a third of us&lt;/a&gt; at some point during our lifetimes. Scientists are consistently making new discoveries about the different factors that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-a-high-fat-diet-may-increase-your-anxiety-study-warns"&gt;increase the risk of anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and how we might be able &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-secret-to-anxiety-in-young-womens-brains-may-have-been-found"&gt;to better treat it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although only shown in mice so far, this new study hints at how the earliest stages of life could influence anxiety risk in adults, and may even feed into the development of diagnostic tests for the condition and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-5-minute-breathing-technique-is-a-powerful-tool-to-reduce-anxiety"&gt;perhaps even treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a reminder of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vitamin-d-during-pregnancy-linked-to-cognitive-boost-in-children"&gt;how vital a healthy pregnancy is&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers are keen to continue their work by looking more closely at the mechanism they've uncovered, and why only a subset of neurons are affected by stresses in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A mouse may have almost 400,000 cells in the vDG, but only a few thousand are impacted during pregnancy," &lt;a href="https://news.weill.cornell.edu/news/2025/09/inflammation-during-pregnancy-may-prime-offspring-for-anxiety"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Toth. "Next, we really want to understand why these certain cells are epigenetically programmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116219"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While many participants had completed higher education and were employed or in relationships, the study found that those diagnosed in adulthood reported more psychiatric conditions, higher rates of suicidal thoughts and self-harm, and fewer self-perceived strengths. The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.70073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Autism Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, point to a need for more research and tailored support for this often-overlooked population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a developmental condition characterized by differences in social communication and restricted or repetitive behaviors. While research and diagnosis have traditionally centered on boys, more recent efforts have drawn attention to the ways autism may present differently in women and nonbinary people. Females are less likely to be diagnosed in early childhood, in part due to more subtle behavioral signs and greater likelihood of “masking,” or consciously imitating neurotypical social behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women and gender-diverse individuals have also been underrepresented in clinical studies due to narrow inclusion criteria, diagnostic biases, and the tendency of researchers to exclude people with co-occurring intellectual disabilities, who are disproportionately female. As a result, there has been limited understanding of what life looks like for autistic women and nonbinary individuals beyond childhood—especially those who are diagnosed in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the new study set out to better characterize this population by assessing a wide range of factors, including education, employment, relationships, psychiatric history, and self-perceived mental health. A second goal was to explore how outcomes differ between those diagnosed in childhood versus adulthood, with the aim of understanding how timing of diagnosis may shape long-term experiences and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research focuses on diverse experiences of autism, including adult populations and autistic females,” said study author Maire Claire Diemer, a clinical psychology postdoctoral fellow at the Medical University of South Carolina. “It’s important to me to fill this gap in the literature and represent what I can as accurately as I can about broader experiences of autistic presentations. Research has often excluded adults, women, and people with co-occurring intellectual disabilities which means that the literature does not always reflect their experiences. This can have clinical implications for care as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data from &lt;a href="https://sparkforautism.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SPARK&lt;/a&gt;, a large national research cohort in the United States that includes over 100,000 autistic individuals and family members. The sample for this study included 1,424 participants who identified as women or were assigned female at birth and identified as nonbinary. All participants were age 18 or older and had received a professional diagnosis of autism either in childhood or adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be included in the analysis, participants had to provide independent consent and complete several self-report forms about their demographic background, medical and psychiatric history, and psychological functioning. Individuals under guardianship or with uncertain autism diagnoses were excluded to ensure reliability of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a standardized psychological questionnaire known as the Adult Self Report, which assesses areas such as internalizing symptoms (like anxiety and depression), externalizing symptoms (like aggression and rule-breaking), substance use, adaptive functioning, and personal strengths. The researchers also collected information about participants’ education, employment, income, romantic relationships, and sexual orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared the responses of those who had been diagnosed before age 18 with those who had received a diagnosis in adulthood. They used statistical methods to control for age at enrollment, since those diagnosed as children were, on average, younger at the time of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average age of diagnosis among the full sample was 24 years, but there was wide variability. Those diagnosed in childhood were typically diagnosed around age 9, while those diagnosed as adults received their diagnosis at an average age of 32. Nearly two-thirds of the sample had been diagnosed after turning 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges often associated with autism, many participants reported positive life outcomes. More than half were employed, and over 80 percent had completed some post-secondary education. Nearly one-third were married, and more than half reported having a romantic partner. Those diagnosed in adulthood were more likely to have a four-year college degree, full-time employment, and higher household incomes than those diagnosed in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, rates of co-occurring psychiatric conditions were high. Around 70 percent of participants reported a history of anxiety, and 62 percent had been diagnosed with depression. Eating disorders were reported by 17 percent of the sample, and almost 9 percent had a substance use diagnosis. A third of all participants reported experiencing suicidal thoughts, and 21 percent said they had engaged in self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diemer was particularly surprised by the high rate of suicidal ideation and behavior. “While I feared there would be increased risks, the high rate still shocked and concerned me,” she told PsyPost. “We have really limited research into what might be driving this or what we can do to be preventative on this front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the two groups, those diagnosed as adults were significantly more likely to report psychiatric conditions. They were more likely to have anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, and reported higher levels of substance use. On average, they also scored higher on internalizing and externalizing problem scales and lower on measures of personal strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns held even after controlling for other demographic variables like age, education, employment, and parenthood. Later age of diagnosis remained a significant predictor of psychological distress. The researchers suggest that these differences may reflect the cumulative impact of going through childhood and adolescence without the support or self-understanding that a diagnosis can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found elevated levels of suicidal ideation and self-harm among participants who identified as gender-diverse or as part of a sexual minority. While 14 percent of cisgender heterosexual participants reported self-harm or suicide attempts, the rate was nearly 27 percent among those identifying as queer or gender-diverse. Suicidal thoughts were endorsed by 41 percent of gender and sexual minorities, compared to 26 percent of cisgender heterosexual participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest concern here is the high rate of suicidal ideation and behavior,” Diemer said. “As researchers, we expected higher rates of co-occurring concerns in this sample compared to a neurotypical sample based on prior findings. However, more than two thirds of our sample had depression diagnoses, and overall rates were much higher than even we expected. Supports for autistic adults is extremely limited, and more wraparound services and mental health care with specialized focus is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study provides important insights, it is not without limitations. The sample was overwhelmingly white and highly educated, which may not reflect the broader population of autistic women and nonbinary people. The participants were also self-selected and enrolled in a research study requiring internet access and independent consent, which may have skewed the sample toward individuals with lower support needs and higher cognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This sample is not as racially diverse as the population as a whole; over-representation of the white female autistic perspective means that the generalizability of the findings are limited,” Diemer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the authors argue that the findings point to clear directions for future research and clinical care. In particular, they emphasize the need to understand the lived experiences of those who receive an autism diagnosis in adulthood. They also highlight the importance of developing targeted mental health interventions that address the specific challenges faced by autistic women and nonbinary individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to continue examining data we have on autistic females, and hopefully presenting some other findings from this sample soon,” Diemer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.70073" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Comparative Analysis of Autistic Women Across the Lifespan: Childhood vs. Adulthood Diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Maire Claire Diemer, Rosmary Ros-Demarize, Catherine C.

			&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, most heart attacks have been blamed on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/plastic-found-inside-more-than-50-of-plaques-from-clogged-arteries"&gt;clogged arteries&lt;/a&gt; causing &lt;a href="https://cardiology.com.sg/atherothrombosis/"&gt;atherothrombosis&lt;/a&gt; – where blood clots block flow to the heart. But new research suggests we may be underestimating the role of other causes, particularly in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the Mayo Clinic in the US analyzed 1,474 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;heart attack cases&lt;/a&gt; in people aged 65 or younger, recorded between 2003 and 2018 in Olmsted County, Minnesota. By carefully reviewing medical records and imaging, they identified a primary cause behind each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atherothrombosis accounted for 75 percent of heart attacks in men, which wasn't surprising. In women, it was the cause of 47 percent – less than half. That has major implications for the prevention and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-drug-better-than-aspirin-for-repeat-heart-attacks-study-finds"&gt;treatment of heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/viral-heart-attack-hack-on-social-media-could-put-lives-at-risk-experts-say"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral Heart Attack 'Hack' on Social Media Could Put Lives at Risk, Experts Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research shines a spotlight on heart attack causes that have historically been under-recognized, particularly in women," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Claire Raphael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the root cause of a heart attack is misunderstood, it can lead to treatments that are less effective – or even harmful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175234" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175234" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart.jpg" alt="Heart attack causes" class="wp-image-175234 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/DiagnosisChart-600x251.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175234" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There were significant differences in heart attack causes between men and women. (Raphael et al., &lt;em&gt;J. Am. Coll.

If heart attack causes are misdiagnosed, then doctors might take the wrong approach to trying to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-vitamin-may-help-prevent-heart-attacks-new-evidence"&gt;prevent the next one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research highlights the larger need to rethink how we approach heart attacks in this patient population, and for younger adult women, in particular," &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-reveals-hidden-causes-of-heart-attacks-in-younger-adults-especially-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cardiologist Rajiv Gulati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians must sharpen their awareness of conditions like SCAD, embolism and stress-related triggers, and patients should advocate for answers when something doesn't feel right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study didn't explore the significant difference here between men and women, but it could be the result of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-minute-quiz-could-reveal-whether-youre-at-risk-of-a-heart-attack"&gt;heart attack risk factors&lt;/a&gt; affecting women differently, or women being less likely to seek medical help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's something that future research can look into, as well as using the same analysis techniques across larger and more diverse groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, someone experiences a heart attack &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html"&gt;every 40 seconds&lt;/a&gt;, and work continues to try and understand as much as we can about the risk factors – which include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/big-city-lights-could-be-damaging-your-heart-health"&gt;city living&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-gram-of-salt-is-the-difference-for-millions-of-heart-attacks"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-particles-in-the-air-may-trigger-sudden-heart-attacks-study-suggests"&gt;air pollution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, as the team notes, we're getting better at spotting, diagnosing, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.120.047065"&gt;preventing heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; from recurring.

					&lt;p&gt;After you reach 40, it’s natural to experience hormonal shifts, slower recovery time, and a decline in physical activity. All of this speeds up sarcopenia, the loss of lean muscle mass. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-build-muscle-as-you-age/" target="_blank"&gt;Building and maintaining muscle&lt;/a&gt; is essential for leading an all-around healthy, independent, and active lifestyle. The good news is, you can work out with just your body weight to achieve noticeable strength gains. We spoke with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/mattdustin" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Dustin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NASM corrective exercise specialist with &lt;i&gt;Garage Gym Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, who shares four stellar &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-exercises-strength-no-equipment/" target="_blank"&gt;bodyweight exercises&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-bodyweight-power-moves-stop-muscle-loss-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;stop muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; more effectively than weight machines after 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Muscle is critical for maintaining metabolism, protecting bone density, and preserving balance and mobility,” Dustin stresses. “If you don’t fight back with resistance work, you lose strength and independence more quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;That’s where bodyweight training comes in clutch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bodyweight training demands full-body coordination, stability, and balance. Machines usually isolate a muscle while providing extra support, but bodyweight movements make your joints, stabilizers, and nervous system work together,” Dustin adds. “That makes them more functional and they translate better to real-life strength.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4 Effective Bodyweight Exercises To Prevent Muscle Loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on your core, glutes, and legs is essential, as Dustin notes they’re “the foundation for movement and balance.” Of course, don’t neglect your upper body—especially the shoulders and back—to maintain solid posture and avoid injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This move builds core stability and gives your shoulders some extra work, too,” Dustin points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a high plank with your hands under your shoulders and body straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your right hand to tap your left shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hand on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap your left hand to your right shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to alternate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets, holding each plank for 20 to 40 seconds, tapping each shoulder as you go.&lt;/li&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Three children have died of measles this week as a monthslong outbreak continues to spread across Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the victims of the disease this week were younger than two, and all three died in Jerusalem, according to hospital officials and the Health Ministry. The first death was announced on Monday, another died on Wednesday night, and the third died Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, five children, all younger than two and a half years old, have died of measles since August. They are the first fatalities from measles in Israel since a previous outbreak hit the country in 2018-2019. The fatalities in that bout of measles were the first Israel had seen since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The current outbreak, which began in May, is active throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases have appeared in the central cities of Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh and Bnei Brak, the northern cities of Harish and Nof HaGalil, the southern cities of Ashdod and Kiryat Gat, and the West Bank settlement of Modi’in Illit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Three Jerusalem children die of measles this week as outbreak continues"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, 21 measles patients are hospitalized, most of them children 6 or under who have not been vaccinated against measles. Of these, six children are in intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late August, the Health Ministry &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/770-measles-cases-detected-in-israel-in-past-three-months-says-health-ministry/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that 770 people in Israel had been diagnosed with measles over the past three months. Multiple people with measles, or who had been exposed to the disease, are reported to have come to Israel on flights from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, life-threatening viral disease. When symptoms appear, it is important to inform medical teams to allow treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable through an effective and safe vaccine. Doctors have &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/infectious-disease-doctor-calls-on-community-leaders-to-encourage-measles-vaccines/"&gt;urged&lt;/a&gt; ramped-up vaccination drives in response to the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;span&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            

&lt;p&gt;Maria Branyas was the oldest person in the world when she died at 117 in Spain last year – but a look at her genome suggests that her biological age may have been much younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts and the public alike have long been fascinated with supercentenarians – those who live to at least 110 – and what their longevity reveals about the keys to ageing well.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;Before she died in August 2024, Branyas agreed to help a group of Spanish scientists find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was 116, they collected samples of her blood, saliva, urine, and stool to analyse her genetics and microbiome and compare the results with bigger groups of similarly aged people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branyas had biomarkers of very old age, including shortened telomeres – which indicate cellular ageing – as well as a type of B cell known to accumulate with age and clonal hematopoiesis, another age-related condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, she also had low inflammation levels, “rejuvenated” gut health, and a youthful epigenome, or changes to how genes are expressed without affecting our actual DNA.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Branyas, who the researchers called “one exceptional individual,” also had unusual variations in her genetic code that appeared to protect against common health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration, which is linked to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings offer “a fresh look at human ageing biology, suggesting biomarkers for healthy ageing, and potential strategies to increase life expectancy,” according to the researchers, who published their findings in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00441-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell Reports Medicine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Branyas’s genetics seem to have played a major role in her longevity, the researchers also tried to identify which of her lifestyle habits may have helped.&lt;/p&gt;
  


&lt;p&gt;The supercentenarian ate about three yoghurts per day, they said, which they said may have contributed to her gut health and body weight. She mainly stuck to a Mediterranean diet, kept good sleep habits, stayed physically active, and had good mental health overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branyas also had an active social life and had regular hobbies such as reading, playing the piano, and tending her garden – in other words, a well-rounded life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All these findings illustrate how ageing and disease can, under certain conditions, become decoupled,” the researchers said, “challenging the common perception that they are inextricably linked”.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

I keep my blood pressure under control and exercise five days a week at a gym, doing 30 minutes of cardio and lifting light weights. However, I have osteoporosis. As I have declined to take medications such as Fosamax due to their potential side effects, my doctor has suggested that I take 1,400 mg of calcium and 600 mg of vitamin K per day (500 mg of MK-4 and 100 mg of MK-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I also take 35 mcg of vitamin D3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/story/life/advice/2025/09/23/dr-roach-gallbladder-surgery-benefits-need-to-be-weighed-against-risks/86183974007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/advice/2025/09/23/dr-roach-gallbladder-surgery-benefits-need-to-be-weighed-against-risks/86183974007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Gallbladder surgery benefits need to be weighed against risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While I eat a reasonably good diet, it could be better. Would it be better for me to go on a strict diet of eating foods that contain high levels of calcium, and if so, which foods (and at which quantities) would I have to eat to properly address my osteoporosis? Are there supplements or other ways to address this to reduce or eliminate my osteoporosis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— O.H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear O.H.:&lt;/strong&gt; Calcium and vitamin D are standard treatments for osteoporosis. However, they are often inadequate to restore severe bone loss, so I don't recommend them as the only treatment in people who have severe osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Calcium is more effective and safer when obtained through the diet compared to supplements, so I do recommend a high-calcium diet for those who are open to it. About 1,400 mg of calcium a day is a reasonable dose, and you can reduce your supplements with additional dietary calcium such as dairy and fish with bones (sardines and anchovies). Almonds, beans, and dark, leafy green vegetables are also modest sources of calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It's almost impossible to get enough vitamin D through the diet, so supplements are the safest way to consume more vitamin D. But sun exposure is an option, especially for lighter-skinned people and those living further south (e.g., below the line of Los Angeles to Atlanta).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Vitamin K2 was found to be a useful treatment in Japan, but no study in the United States found a significant enough benefit for me to recommend its use. However, it is safe. Prunes were found to have a modest improvement in bone density in women who consumed 4 ounces daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For men in their 70s with osteoporosis, checking their testosterone blood levels is mandatory as this is a common risk for the development of bone loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If your osteoporosis is severe, and you have a high risk of fracture that was calculated by the FRAX score, I recommend considering treatment such as parathyroid hormone analogues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I have suffered with an idiopathic peripheral neuropathy for over 20 years. I currently take duloxetine and gabapentin for the pain. They are somewhat helpful, but their side effects are problematic even at low doses.Lately I've found articles on the internet recommending vitamin B1 for nerve improvement. Does your practice support its use for neuropathy? Any thoughts are appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— J.A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear J.A.:&lt;/strong&gt; "Neuropathy" is a term that relates to any of a large number of conditions that cause damage to the nerves. Peripheral nerves are the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord, and "idiopathic" just means that we don't know the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I have also found articles recommending thiamine, or a drug that is converted to thiamine in the body (benfotiamine), for a peripheral neuropathy from an unknown cause.

&lt;p&gt;We’re headed into cold and flu season and you want your shots, including an updated COVID booster. Where can a New Yorker go to get the jab?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Food and Drug Administration changed its regulations around the COVID vaccine this summer to limit access, New York state crafted a workaround to preserve people’s ability to get a booster. Nonetheless, confusion has reigned in pharmacies across New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; by Gov. Kathy Hochul technically allows pharmacies to administer the vaccine to anyone three years old and older. But the Centers for Disease Control recently changed its guidelines around the COVID vaccine that further mixed messaging, creating a choose-your-own-adventure scenario for shot-seekers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know now about finding (and paying for) the new COVID shots in New York City 2025:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-i-get-a-covid-booster-in-new-york-city-and-where"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get a COVID booster in New York City, and where?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can, but where you get it depends on a few factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At CVS, Walgreens and independent pharmacies, the COVID vaccine is allowed to be administered, but availability and whether you will have to pay for it varies (more on this below).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s Sept. 5 &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-executive-order-expanding-access-vaccines-amid-uncertainty-washington"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; allows pharmacies in the state to offer the COVID vaccine to those under 65 without an underlying health condition and without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt;

Kathy Hochul at a Manhattan pharmacy, Sept. 16, 2025. &lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;&lt;span class="credit-label-wrapper"&gt;Credit:&lt;/span&gt; Alex Krales/THE CITY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She did this in response to the FDA releasing the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/coronavirus-covid-19-cber-regulated-biologics/moderna-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;most restrictive&lt;/a&gt; COVID vaccine regulations since the shot’s inception. The federal policy said that only those 65 and older or people with an underlying condition are eligible to get the updated vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hochul’s executive order suspends those federal rules until Oct. 5, and she may choose to extend it further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the governor’s order, availability of the vaccines is spotty in New York City. When THE CITY reached out to pharmacies across the five boroughs in recent days, many were not offering the shot, or were administering it only to certain populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Esco Pharmacy in Hell’s Kitchen — where Hochul herself &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOrX69ckr4t/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ=="&gt;received the COVID booster last week&lt;/a&gt; — pharmacists are following FDA guidelines and not offering the vaccine to anyone between the ages of 18 and 65 who do not have a health condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is confusing to our staff and the patient, as well,” said Danny Dang, pharmacist at Esco, of the current guidelines. “We do see the benefits of the vaccination. I’ve seen a lot of patients who came to us for COVID treatment that could have been prevented by the vaccine if we had done it earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marisa Donnelly, epidemiologist and author of the column &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com"&gt;“Your Local Epidemiologist,”&lt;/a&gt; explains that just because pharmacies are allowed to administer a vaccine doesn’t mean they will.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“There’s still, I think, a lot of internal policies that different pharmacy companies have,” Donnelly says. “They’re all allowed to give vaccines, but that doesn’t mean that they necessarily will. They can still go with their own guidelines and decide not to give a vaccine if they don’t want to. But they are allowed within the state.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-who-should-get-the-booster"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who should get the booster?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the executive order from Hochul, everyone over three years old should be able to get the COVID shot. But, as stated above, the CDC and FDA says something else entirely, muddying the waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-vaccines.page#:~:text=On%20September%205%2C%20Governor%20Hochul,who%20wish%20to%20be%20vaccinated."&gt;The New York City Health Department&lt;/a&gt; says it is especially important for the following groups of people to get the COVID booster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All adults ages 65 and older&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All children ages 6 to 23 months &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People who are pregnant or recently gave birth &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People of any age who have an underlying condition that increases their risk for severe COVID-19 &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People at high risk of exposure, such as health care workers and people living or working in a nursing home or other congregate setting&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People living with someone with an underlying condition that increases their risk for severe COVID-19&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;People who have never been vaccinated before&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor at the CUNY Graduate School of Public Health &amp;amp; Health Policy, recommends the shot for anyone whose last vaccine was over six months ago, since immunity starts to wane after four to six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On top of that, the last set of vaccines were protected against an earlier variant,” Lee says. “Right now, the variants that are circulating are different from previous, so your protection is probably even lower against the current variants. So if you haven’t gotten a vaccine for at least six months or greater, then it’s a good idea to get the vaccine, especially headed into winter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-about-shots-for-city-kids"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about shots for city kids?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All kids three years to 18 are eligible to be vaccinated in New York State –– no prescription or underlying health condition needed. (6 to 23 month old kids are considered a high risk population and so their eligibility for the vaccine was never under threat)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, THE CITY found that availability for shots for young people is spotty. Some independent pharmacies that are offering the vaccine for adults just don’t have it available or stocked for kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren Naturale, a Sunset Park mom, tried to get her six-year-old daughter vaccinated before traveling for a family wedding where a lot of older people would be in attendance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturale attempted to make a vaccine appointment for her daughter at CVS, but when she went to finalize, would repeatedly get an error message. She tried again the following week and was able to make an appointment. Upon arrival at a CVS that was 40 minutes away, Naturale was told the store must have miscategorized them in CVS’s system because they did not have vaccines for children under 12. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It sounds like you can get them, it would just be great if there was clear information,” Naturale said about children’s vaccines in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She wasn’t able to get her daughter one before they left for the wedding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll be able to make that happen when we get back to the city,” Naturale said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shots for all young people under 19 years old should be covered by your insurer by law. (More on this below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-i-need-a-prescription"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I need a prescription?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you do not need a prescription to get the COVID shot. Hochul’s executive order from earlier this month made it clear that people seeking the COVID vaccine do not need a prescription. If a provider demands one, try another pharmacy, call your local health department about finding a vaccine, or contact your primary care doctor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-is-this-going-to-cost-me"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is this going to cost me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This really depends on your insurance and whether your insurer is choosing to cover the COVID vaccine right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because a key committee at the Centers for Disease Control — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html"&gt;declined last week to recommend&lt;/a&gt; the COVID vaccine this season. Its recommendation is the federal standard insurers traditionally follow for coverage of all kinds of medical services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means: Local pharmacies are allowed to give the COVID vaccine, but it may not be paid for by your insurance. At &lt;a href="https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine"&gt;CVS&lt;/a&gt;, an out of pocket COVID vaccine could cost you up to $249.99. At Esco Pharmacy, an independent pharmacy in Hell’s Kitchen, it costs about $265, staff there said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry-guidance/circular-letters/cl2025-05"&gt;Department of Financial Services&lt;/a&gt; issued guidance encouraging insurers to continue covering the COVID vaccine, but that isn’t binding. However, the letter notes that New York State law requires insurers to fully cover vaccines for children under 19, because they were deemed necessary immunizations in 2020 –– a decision that still stands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some insurers, like UnitedHealthcare, are choosing to continue covering the shot for everyone despite the ACIP declining to recommend the shot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“For our standard commercial plans, we will continue to cover claims for COVID-19 vaccines with no cost share,” UnitedHealthcare said in a statement. The insurer said they recommend members who use an employer sponsored plan to confirm benefits with their specific plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-my-local-pharmacy-isn-t-offering-the-shot-what-now"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My local pharmacy isn’t offering the shot. What now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee recommends contacting your doctor’s office or the &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/neighborhood-health/health-services.page"&gt;local health department&lt;/a&gt; if you’re having trouble getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walgreens and CVS have the COVID vaccine available for those under 65 without a health condition. But to schedule an appointment online, you have to “confirm you are eligible,” or answer yes that you have a health condition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My guess is the reason that that is existing is because it’s a national website,” Donnelly says. “And so I imagine that they have some of those settings for everywhere across the country, even if they don’t necessarily apply to New York State. But I do think that that’s a potential source of confusion for people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Donnelly worries that mixed messaging around the COVID vaccine is causing less people to get it, and even worse, sowing distrust in the medical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest issue right now is there’s so much noise around vaccines and it’s so confusing to follow,” Donnelly says. “So I think that’s actually a potential deterrent for a lot of families that want to get vaccinated, but that maybe don’t understand that they can or they are eligible now.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-else-can-i-do-to-prevent-covid"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to prevent COVID?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee notes that while the COVID vaccine does protect against the worst outcomes of the virus, it doesn’t guarantee not getting it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You also want to continue to take other types of precautions, especially when you’re in a location or an area where the risk of getting infected is high,” Lee says. “Say you’re in a very crowded location, it’s still important to make sure that the area is well ventilated. That, and evidence has shown that masks can help cut down transmission. So, all of these things that came out during the beginning of the COVID pandemic still hold.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time of mixed messaging, it’s important to distinguish which evidence is scientifically sound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you see something that’s repeated across different respectable and evidence-based websites, then you can feel more confident that it’s a consensus that different folks have come to the same conclusion,” Lee says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most reliable sources, he says, include international health organizations like the World Health Organization, Health Canada, and the U.K.’s The National Health Service. Major U.S. health systems like John Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, and the Cleveland Clinic also provide trustworthy guidance. The New York City’s health department is also considered one of the largest public health agencies in the world and offers evidence-based health recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

If the amygdala detects a threat, such as an approaching burglar, snake or bear, it then sends messages to the hypothalamus, a region just above the back of the neck. The hypothalamus then &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-hpa-axis" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;communicates&lt;/a&gt; with the pituitary gland, which in turns gets the adrenal glands to release cortisol and adrenaline into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"This will cause your heart rate to go up, blood pressure to rise, and all the classic sort of fight-or-flight symptoms of a typical fear response will be evoked," says Feinstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;However, when it comes to internal threats, such as detecting raised levels of CO2 in the blood, the brain manages things in a different way. The body interprets the high CO2 as a sign of impending suffocation, as there aren't any oxygen sensors in the bloodstream. Feinstein's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051122000473" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that it is the brainstem, a region that regulates unconscious bodily functions such as breathing, that senses the rise in CO2 and initiates a sense of panic. The amygdala puts the brakes on this response, preventing fear; hence why patients like SM, who are missing their amygdala, have such an exaggerated response. (Scientists still don't know why, however, the amygdala behaves this way.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 09:01:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNdDNwenZiSUUyOC1EMm9Eb3B0RWthVUdNSGpKMHdJYXdWQjJoekZ2N2hDLThNdm9ra3dmaEJFcWc2SklLY2loZWgyd2gtZWJpM2NmTlppT2xTSkVfZjVFaXI3YWswNUF0WHB2RE9oc2YwaFJ4TnNZdnBuUk5EZ0t0RnMxZGd3V1NrX2dLVFdjMlA</guid></item><item><title>疫苗混乱？明尼苏达州的5个问题，已回答- MPR新闻</title><link>https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/09/25/answers-to-questions-about-covid19-vaccines</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="Auth_supplementalText__LpEPr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By submitting, you consent that you are at least 18 years of age and to receive information about MPR's or APMG entities' programs and offerings.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been 70 years since Philadelphia-based McNeil Laboratories introduced the first pure acetaminophen product to American consumers: Elixir Tylenol, a prescription painkiller and fever treatment for kids. Advertised as being “for little hotheads,” the medicine came in a red paper carton shaped like a fire engine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, it’s become one of the world’s most ubiquitous drugs, but also one whose safety has periodically been challenged, as it was this week when President Trump forcefully and publicly urged pregnant women &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/22/trump-autism-action-plan-tylenol-link-leucovorin-treatment/"&gt;to abstain from taking Tylenol&lt;/a&gt;, asserting, without clear scientific evidence, a potential link to autism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s perhaps surprising that a product so widely used would become a medicinal scapegoat. Trump’s statements at &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/23/trump-as-doctor-in-chief-autism-tylenol-vaccines-covid/"&gt;an extraordinary press conference&lt;/a&gt; Monday have drawn &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/24/tylenol-use-pregnancy-fever-greater-risk-than-autism/"&gt;a flood of pushback&lt;/a&gt; from medical societies, autism organizations, and pediatric experts. But acetaminophen’s long and twisting origin story, going back four centuries to indigenous people’s use of the cinnamon-colored bark of the Cinchona tree in the febrile jungles of Peru, is pocked with safety scares — sometimes unfounded, other times real. It’s a history that casts just enough ambient uncertainty to invite in the type of conspiratorial thinking fueling the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/23/trump-autism-vaccine-stance-shows-rising-influence-rfk-jr/"&gt;politically ascendant&lt;/a&gt; Make America Healthy Again movement.&lt;/p&gt;

His family are now braced to fight a new challenge after he was diagnosed with infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was having dreams of planning his funeral,' his mother Kelsey, 34, told the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelsey noticed his delayed motor skills at around eight months. Despite starting physical therapy, he made no progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concerns heightened at around 18 months, when Jack could not walk or bear weight on his legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelsey used to call him 'spaghetti man' because he would collapse every time he attempted to stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After endless physical therapy and doctors visits, the New Jersey family was left in the dark for another six months when a lab lost Jack's samples for his neurological genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some days filled with hope, others with really dark thoughts,' said Tim Drury, Jack’s father. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;his delayed milestones lead to the discovery of a rare degenerative nervous system disorder with an average life expectancy of just ten years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A month after his second birthday, Jack was diagnosed with INAD, a rare genetic disorder caused by a genetic mutation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A month after his second birthday, Jack was diagnosed with INAD, a rare genetic disorder caused by a genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both parents pass a copy of the faulty PLA2G6 gene to the fetus. While carrier screening is available, it is complex because INAD is extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It affects the nerve cell that carries messages from the brain to other parts of the body, according to the National institution of neurological disorders (NIH). There is no known cure or treatment to slow the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A baby with INAD is alert and responsive for the first few years but starts to lose vision, muscular control, and mental skills over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fewer than 250 kids worldwide have been diagnosed according to The National Organization for Rare disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rare diagnosis even stunned Jack's pediatricians.

They said the finding could one day lead to drug treatments designed to target the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London examined genetic data from the tumours of 644 patients and found that levels of the SPP1 protein were raised in the advanced stages of pancreatic cancer, compared with earlier stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with higher levels of SPP1 had worse outcomes, according to the research, which has been published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, also used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body. They found that when they “switched off” the gene to make the SPP1 protein, fewer and smaller tumours developed than when the protein was present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that this protein played a key role in mice with PDAC. They found that “switching off” SPP1 significantly extended survival among mice – none of the mice with the gene survived past 50 days, whereas 20 per cent of the mice without the gene survived to 400 days, the ICR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found that the mice with the SPP1 gene switched off had tumours that did not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kIHKfN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/14/16/9bc36b1928bbb8bc24d119c5e1099357Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzIzNzI2MDgz-2.76852342.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-18008"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The team, funded by the ICR and Breast Cancer Now, used lab-grown mini tumours designed to model the way cancer behaves in the human body&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking SPP1 also appeared to raise the levels of another protein called GREM1, which has previously been linked to reducing pancreatic cancer spread when it is found in higher concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axel Behrens, a professor of stem cell biology at the ICR, said: “Our research has identified a protein that, when blocked, can prevent cancer from spreading around the body and can hopefully keep patients living well for longer. The next step for this research will be to develop a drug that can precisely target the protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kristian Helin, chief executive of the ICR, added: “Pancreatic cancer remains a devastating diagnosis for patients, as its most common form spreads aggressively and is difficult to treat. This exciting research offers hope, identifying a clear target to halt the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s an important step toward more effective treatments, and I look forward to future drug-discovery efforts building on these findings to provide new options to patients in urgent need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anna Jewell, director of research at Pancreatic Cancer UK, said: “Over half of people diagnosed with this devastating disease die within just three months, an appalling survival rate that has barely changed since the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We desperately need new, more effective treatments, and this study sheds new light on a key protein that helps pancreatic cancer spread around the body so rapidly. These promising findings could pave the way for the development of new drugs to target this protein and halt the cancer’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pancreatic cancer is very aggressive. Once discovered it’s often so advanced that seven in 10 people receive no active treatment – not even chemotherapy.

It also led to a significant reduction in a biomarker of neurodegeneration, found in cerebrospinal fluid, which usually increases with disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-breakthrough-experimental-drug-suppresses-huntington-s-protein-first-time-ionis-httrx-gene"&gt;Huge Breakthrough as Experimental Drug Is First-Ever to Suppress Huntington's Protein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the basis of these results, it seems likely AMT-130 will be the first licensed treatment to slow Huntington's disease, which is truly world-changing stuff," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wild, who works at UCL's Huntington's Disease Center, the largest Huntington's clinical group in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington's is caused by a single defect in the gene &lt;em&gt;HTT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(93)90585-E"&gt;discovered in 1993&lt;/a&gt;, which gradually destroys the body's ability to function. It does so by making a toxic version of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtin"&gt;huntingtin protein&lt;/a&gt;, which attacks neurons in parts of the brain involved in voluntary movement, thinking, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When visible symptoms take hold, typically in mid-adulthood, patients generally have just &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/huntingtons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20356117"&gt;10 to 30 years to live&lt;/a&gt;. A parent with Huntington's has a 50 percent chance of passing the disease on to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For roughly a decade, researchers at &lt;a href="https://www.uniqure.com/pioneers-leaders"&gt;uniQure&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/emmm.201202291"&gt;world's first approved gene therapy&lt;/a&gt;, have been investigating if a similar method could work as a treatment for Huntington's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175477" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130.jpg" alt="Gene Therapy Huntington's" class="size-full wp-image-175477" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130.jpg 638w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AMT130-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175477" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;uniQure's explanation from 2019 for how it administers AMT-130. (&lt;a href="https://factor-h.org/2020-9-26-updates-on-clinical-studies-targeting-htt-and-other-topics"&gt;uniQure&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's novel drug was tested by neurologists in the United Kingdom, as it involves major brain surgery. The idea is that when high-dose AMT-130 is injected into the brain, neurons take up the custom-made DNA permanently. The genetic information contains instructions that stop cells from making the mutant huntingtin protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers expect the single dose to last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trial results come through in numbers and graphs, but behind each data point is an incredible patient who volunteered to undergo major neurosurgery to be treated with the first gene therapy we've ever tested in Huntington's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is an extraordinary act of bravery for the benefit of humanity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the phase 1/2 clinical trial, 29 patients volunteered to be treated with AMT-130, with 17 receiving a high dose and 12 receiving a low dose. Researchers then followed up with a dozen patients from each group over the course of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high-dose group showed 75 percent less disease progression than participants who did not receive any AMT-130.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not quite the "&lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii"&gt;potentially curative results&lt;/a&gt;" the company was hoping to deliver, but it could still be a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gene-therapy-can-restore-hearing-in-adults-first-of-its-kind-trial-shows"&gt;life-changing breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; and the first real treatment for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_175481" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-175481" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains.jpg" alt="HD brains" class="size-full wp-image-175481" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/HD_brains-600x236.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-175481" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The brain of someone with Huntington's Disease (right) next to a health control (left). (&lt;a href="https://sites.uab.edu/mgraylab/huntingtons-disease/"&gt;University of Alabama at Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My patients in the trial are stable over time in a way I'm not used to seeing in Huntington's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/sep/gene-therapy-appears-slow-huntingtons-disease-progression"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wild, "and one of them is my only medically retired Huntington's disease patient who has been able to go back to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed at which AMT-130 has come to &lt;span&gt;clinical trials&lt;/span&gt; is impressive. In the span of &lt;a href="https://www.biospace.com/uniqure-announces-preclinical-proof-of-concept-for-gene-therapy-approach-in-huntington-s-disease-709323?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;roughly a decade&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at uniQure have taken promising preclinical data and replicated the results in animals and then humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is now conducting further &lt;span&gt;clinical trials&lt;/span&gt; in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chief medical officer, Walid Abi-Saab, &lt;a href="https://uniqure.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/uniqure-announces-positive-topline-results-pivotal-phase-iii"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; uniQure is "eager to discuss the data with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)… later this year, with the goal of submitting a Biologics License Application in the first quarter of 2026."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US FDA has already granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation and a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation, both of which could speed up its approval process. After that, uniQure also plans to apply for approval in the UK and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trial results will be presented at the &lt;a href="https://huntingtonstudygroup.org/annual-meeting/2025-hd-clinical-research-congress/"&gt;HD Clinical Research Congress&lt;/a&gt; in October.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="384118f2-43fc-4a67-89a0-93821e7c9cde"&gt;No matter your relationship with exercise, it’s probably been drilled into you that you should warm up before playing sport or doing a workout. But does that apply to walking workouts too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s good to warm up before any type of exercise to promote proper movement mechanics and assist in preventing minor injuries that may occur when starting a workout cold,” says Solomon Lewis, a NASM-certified personal trainer and fitness specialist for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.endeavorhealth.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.endeavorhealth.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Endeavor Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="384118f2-43fc-4a67-89a0-93821e7c9cde-2"&gt;Even though walking is relatively low intensity, making a warm-up less important than if you were lifting heavy weights or running a marathon, Lewis pointed out that warming up before any workout can also serve to get you into the right mindset, and it’s a good idea if you’ve not moved for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help prepare you for a walking workout, Lewis recommended three warm-up exercises and shared a 30-minute walking workout once you’re ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Starting with 30 minutes a day and steadily increasing the length or intensity of your walk is a great way to lose weight, strengthen your bones and improve your cardiovascular fitness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautions that if you are deconditioned, starting with a 30-minute workout out of the gate might be too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking for 30 minutes straight can be challenging. It may be simpler to incorporate small bouts of walking into your daily routine by parking in the farthest parking spot, walking to the farthest restroom and taking the stairs instead of the elevator,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWvvJhJGfNGyCUz5jqR2jC" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-bWvvJhJGfNGyCUz5jqR2jC slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/walking/walking-plan-weight-loss" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/walking/walking-plan-weight-loss"&gt;walking plan for weight loss&lt;/a&gt; may also help, because it can be adjusted to your current step count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-warm-up-exercises-for-walking-workouts" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-warm-up-exercises-for-walking-workouts"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warm-up exercises for walking workouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a id="elk-f348be17-9037-481c-a0e1-8a35962f0daf" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-bodyweight-squat-3"&gt;1.

These groundbreaking data are the most convincing evidence in the field to date, and underscore the disease-modifying effect in Huntington’s disease, where an urgent need persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For patients, AMT-130 has the potential to preserve daily function, keep them in work longer, and meaningfully slow disease progression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOMW1zUlhEc0JXYU5pcGNoNHZ2NzN3V3AwTTZESmNtLVJ3VmQ1dl9lNlpBSFNjTlhhNHUtUkxKOE9IN1NST3lhRUE1dWNNY3VSaWQ5bThtOFBGcHNJS1FBVGd0dXNiRDdIYjdzd1VSXzlpdi0ybFpSWnRaYXEzZzMxS0tWbXFEYUVyOUQtMGZHOHRrRmhxcFRsSGloMkZCNUJxZk5BcXNFYzQzZEtFaTJadi1n</guid></item><item><title>“这个日常习惯可以挽救你的生命！” ： 100岁的医生分享了令人惊讶的秘密，更长久，更健康-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-one-daily-habit-can-save-your-life-100-year-old-doctor-shares-surprising-secret-to-longer-healthier-living/articleshow/124087520.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Scharffenberg, a 100-year-old preventive medicine doctor and nutrition expert from California, reveals a simple yet powerful secret to longevity: daily exercise. He emphasizes that consistent physical activity can help individuals live longer, even those who are obese or face other health challenges. While traditional advice often highlights weight control, cholesterol management, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, Dr. Scharffenberg explains that these alone do not guarantee a long life. Instead, he stresses that daily movement plays a more critical role in extending lifespan, improving circulation, enhancing mental clarity, boosting immune function, and preserving muscle strength with age. His insights offer a fresh perspective on longevity, showing that small, consistent lifestyle habits—like exercising every day—can profoundly impact overall health, resilience against disease, and the quality of life not just physically, but emotionally and cognitively well into old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How daily exercise becomes the ultimate secret to longer, healthier life; doctor reveals&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Instagram post by LongevityXlab on August 25, Dr. Scharffenberg emphasized the importance of daily physical activity. He said, “We need to exercise every day. That’s very important. I have outlived my two brothers, 13 and 17 years respectively. And each year I survive adds to that number.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective highlights that longevity is not merely about genetics or body weight, but about consistent, daily habits that strengthen the body and improve resilience against disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scharffenberg explained a striking example from his own experience: he once spoke to a woman assisting him with PowerPoint presentations. Though she was obese, he encouraged her to focus on daily movement. He shared,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should understand that being overweight increases the risk of dying from almost every disease we know. But here’s the good news: even if you are obese, exercising every day will help you live longer than a person of normal weight who does not exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement underscores a critical point for longevity and preventive health: daily exercise can mitigate risks associated with obesity, hypertension, smoking, and high cholesterol, potentially extending life expectancy significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How exercise protects against disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Scharffenberg’s guidance aligns with extensive research showing that regular physical activity strengthens cardiovascular health, improves metabolism, reduces inflammation, and boosts mental resilience. Even small daily routines, such as walking, stretching, or light resistance exercises, can have a profound impact over time, especially when paired with balanced nutrition, adequate hydration, and quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes that the benefits are cumulative. Individuals who consistently move their bodies every day tend to experience lower rates of chronic illness and enhanced overall vitality, regardless of other risk factors or genetic predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical tips for incorporating daily exercise&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to follow Dr. Scharffenberg’s advice, simple strategies can help make exercise a consistent habit:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Begin with manageable activities like brisk walking, cycling, or yoga.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Schedule at least 20–30 minutes of movement daily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on variety to engage different muscle groups and maintain interest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair exercise with proper nutrition and adequate sleep for maximum longevity benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By integrating exercise into your daily routine, even individuals with obesity or other health challenges can improve lifespan and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/barack-obama-meets-102-year-old-woman-her-simple-food-secrets-go-viral-inspiring-millions-with-longevity-lessons-and-life-tips/articleshow/124084018.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Barack Obama meets 102-year-old woman: HER simple food secrets go viral, inspiring millions with longevity lessons and life tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 04:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgJBVV95cUxQckFqLU5Wcm9DNDJ4TWh1bmNCc2huZUFsWVdzdFhHdjJGcVVzMUEzRTFlN05PNXVveHBfZFVhS25IRWxCMENQeURVZF9CNEpEcm1wQ29saHJBWGFHMU5YeWRXRmNYaFRCWExxN2o2c0hOay1Hb3pnU1NvVWplRC14SDUzd2F4X2dMUHUwck9vMndlMkhzYl9ITEttWkdXRE40dVFnbXRERklGLTBKSGl4M1h3TVh5WWFrX1pLaFlva1lDcURBNS01bm9SYlpzUjFxVWlzTFpBeUp3OF9LcEJaYnE2Z3RuN2lybk9CVWl6TmFqZHg2VTRjd0Y2NG1KeWlXS2NkMk9STVBIYWwtWEpldlVLQkh3OXJTeTM5c3NMSnA5VzBva19HN0xKRmNrOU04aFdiRGx3</guid></item><item><title>每天喝半茶匙这种油和温水可以改善记忆力-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/having-half-teaspoon-of-this-oil-daily-with-warm-water-can-improve-memory/articleshow/124044482.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that a common kitchen ingredient, probably resting on your kitchen shelf, can reduce the risk of memory loss?

Opting extra virgin olive oil can provide maximum benefits as it has the highest levels of antioxidants and polyphenols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a warm glass of water and add half teaspoon (around 2.5 ml) of olive oil. Stir well and consume in the morning on an empty stomach or before meals if convenient. Remember, not occasional but only regular consumption has proven benefits of memory improvement. Avoid the use of very hot water, as it can damage polyphenols in the olive oil. This simple habit may also aid digestion, reduce inflammation, support heart health, and contribute to healthy aging when practiced consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

						&lt;p&gt;Person County leaders confirmed the county’s eighth
confirmed rabies case this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Person County Animal Services and the Person County Health Department
are urging the public to take precautions after the latest incident involved a
racoon on Ridge Road in the Roxboro city limits.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The county could not confirm any human or domestic animal
contact with the raccoon.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a deadly virus that affects the brain and nervous
system.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Immediate medical attention is critical for humans. Rabies
is 100% preventable if treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Delaying care can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People are urged to remain vigilant and to protect their families
and pets.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;County leaders provided the following reminders:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Do not touch or approach wild animals or unfamiliar pets.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Monitor your surroundings when outdoors.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Keep children and pets supervised and away from
wildlife.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• Ensure all pets are up to date on rabies vaccinations.
This is required by law and critical for their protection.  Rabies
vaccinations are given daily at the shelter during regular business hours, no
appointment necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;• Avoid handling stray or injured animals, even seemingly
friendly animals.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;• If you or someone you know is bitten or scratched by an
animal, or if a pet encounters a wild animal:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o In urgent situations, call 911.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o Seek emergency medical care immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;o Call Animal Control at 336-597-1741 or the Health
Department at 336-597-2204.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Signs of a rabid animal:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
