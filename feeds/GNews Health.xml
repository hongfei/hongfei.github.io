&lt;p&gt;The disease usually develops seven to 14 days after an exposure, but it can take up to 21 days (which is the length of quarantine). Once it develops, it’s marked by a high fever and a telltale rash that starts on the head and spreads downward. People are contagious for four days &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the rash develops and four days after it appears. Complications can range from ear infections and diarrhea to encephalitis (swelling of the brain), pneumonia, death in up to 3 out of 1,000 children, and, in very rare cases, a fatal neurological condition that can develop seven to 10 years after the acute infection (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is considered 97 percent effective against the virus, and that protection is considered lifelong. Ninety-nine percent of the 310 cases in the South Carolina outbreak are in people who are unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, or have an unknown vaccination status (only 2 people were vaccinated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which only has data as of January 6, has tallied three confirmed cases for this year (two in South Carolina and one in North Carolina, linked to the South Carolina outbreak). Since then, South Carolina &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-26-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-211"&gt;reported 26 cases on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and 99 today, totaling 125. North Carolina also reported &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2026/01/06/additional-children-positive-measles-north-carolina"&gt;three additional cases Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, again linked to the South Carolina outbreak. In all, that brings the US tally to at least 131 just nine days into the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the country recorded&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt; 2,144 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, the most cases seen since 1991. Three people died, including &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/second-child-dies-of-measles-anti-vaccine-advocate-reported-it-before-officials/"&gt;two otherwise-healthy children&lt;/a&gt;. In 2000, the US declared measles eliminated, meaning that it was no longer continuously circulating within the country. With ongoing outbreaks, including the one in South Carolina, the country’s elimination status is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                The first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is delivered to newborns for maximum protection. The U.S. has taken the vaccine off its list of recommended vaccines while other countries are racing to secure the lifesaving vaccine vials.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In an unprecedented change, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/06/nx-s1-5667286/u-s-health-officials-reduce-the-number-of-vaccines-recommended-for-all-children" target="_blank"&gt;reduced&lt;/a&gt; the number of vaccines recommended for all children on Monday. One of them is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/vaccination/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, a three-dose series first given at birth that protects against a dangerous virus that relentlessly attacks the liver.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/119th-congress/senate-event/LC74210/text" target="_blank"&gt;long questioned&lt;/a&gt; the safety and efficacy of the newborn dose, even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5597904/" target="_blank"&gt;linking&lt;/a&gt; an ingredient &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4928a4.htm" target="_blank"&gt;long used&lt;/a&gt; in the shot to autism without citing any evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Last month, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/aligning-united-states-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/" target="_blank"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. a "high outlier" in the number of immunizations recommended for all children, a rationale used by the secretary to scrap the hepatitis B newborn vaccine. But according to a memo released by the Department of Health and Human Services last Friday, 20 peer nations — except Denmark and Finland — &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/assessment-of-the-us-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-compared-to-other-countries.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that all kids receive the hepatitis B vaccine, either at birth or later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In the U.S. alone, public health experts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy598" target="_blank"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; more than 1,800 deaths to hepatitis B each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's just really sad," says &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/samuel-so" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Samuel So&lt;/a&gt;, a surgeon specializing in hepatitis B at Stanford Medicine. He treats patients with liver cancer, which the virus can cause. "This has done so much damage to the reputation of the CDC."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health experts &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33915/AAP-Changes-to-hepatitis-B-recommendations?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;agree&lt;/a&gt; that the ultimate result will be a decrease in the number of children who are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other countries face a different situation: They're making a great effort to secure the life-saving vaccine vials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The West African nation of Ghana is among the countries &lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/sites/default/files/content/document/Gavi%20HepB%20programme%20for%20CGHE.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;racing&lt;/a&gt; to obtain them. But the journey to a national immunization program has been a rocky path for the country — and a famous Ghanaian rapper has even stepped in to help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The toll of hepatitis B in Ghana&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in ten Ghanaians has chronic hepatitis B, and about 10,000 new infections are &lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/sites/default/files/content/national_profiles/files/2025-06/2025-05-30_Ghana_National%20Hepatitis%20Elimination%20Profile.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; each year in the country of 35 million. In the U.S., the CDC estimates 20,700 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7113a1" target="_blank"&gt;new infections&lt;/a&gt; annually.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The risks associated with the virus — cirrhosis and liver cancer, among others — can be deadly. Since 2015, deaths from complications of the virus have &lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/sites/default/files/content/national_profiles/files/2025-06/2025-05-30_Ghana_National%20Hepatitis%20Elimination%20Profile.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;risen&lt;/a&gt; in Ghana, with 14,000 people dying in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The cost that it brings onto the patient themselves, their family and then the health system is quite huge," says Charles Adjei, the executive director of the Hepatitis Alliance of Ghana. He noted that his country &lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/sites/default/files/content/national_profiles/files/2025-06/2025-05-30_Ghana_National%20Hepatitis%20Elimination%20Profile.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;still requires&lt;/a&gt; patients to pay out of pocket for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus' &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105317" target="_blank"&gt;ancient roots&lt;/a&gt; — stretching back &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi5658" target="_blank"&gt;millennia&lt;/a&gt; — explain why it hits certain regions of the world harder than others. Over time, the virus has become especially efficient at spreading across entire communities. That spread intensifies when newborn protection is absent or delayed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While unprotected sex and injection drug use are the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7113a1" target="_blank"&gt;main drivers&lt;/a&gt; of transmission in the U.S., Ghana is a different story. "It's a big misconception that you only get hepatitis B from using drugs or unprotected sex," So explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When infants in countries like Ghana miss out on the birth dose, that allows for a particularly dangerous route — mother-to-child transmission — to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" target="_blank"&gt;keep going&lt;/a&gt; unchecked. Risk of transmission to babies &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/hepatitis-preventing-mother-to-child-transmission-of-the-hepatitis-b-virus" target="_blank"&gt;ranges&lt;/a&gt; from anywhere between 10% to 90%, depending on how severe the mom's infection is.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And about 95% of infants are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2025-113229" target="_blank"&gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; with the virus &lt;em&gt;for life&lt;/em&gt;. "It's a life-long stigma," So says. "And when the virus flares up, it could cause life-threatening liver disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Vaccines given at birth offer hope in Ghana&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reducing the spread from mom to child is simple. All it takes is a &lt;a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=dcecf9e0-6c28-4964-9ddb-9379705fa26c" target="_blank"&gt;jab in the thigh&lt;/a&gt; within 24 hours of birth, with two additional pokes later in childhood for long-term protection. That first shot is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2025-113229" target="_blank"&gt;most cost-effective way&lt;/a&gt; to prevent transmission — and the numbers show it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The pillar of prevention of mother-to-child transmission is that timely birth dose," So says. "That will protect most of the newborns born to infected mothers." About 75% to 95% &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-055554" target="_blank"&gt;effective&lt;/a&gt;, in fact, and roughly a quarter of infants gain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.rr6701a1" target="_blank"&gt;lifelong protection&lt;/a&gt; from a single shot alone, and follow-up doses &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.rr6701a1" target="_blank"&gt;strengthen that shield&lt;/a&gt;. The second dose confers long-term protection to about two-thirds of babies, and the third raises that figure to 95%.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, that life-saving intervention isn't widely available in Ghana, despite a 2009 World Health Organization recommendation to all countries to &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091202042250/http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8440.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;administer&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine at birth, updating &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090617172943/http://www.who.int/wer/2004/en/wer7928.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;previous guidance&lt;/a&gt; from five years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, Ghana has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10360654/table/T1/" target="_blank"&gt;mounted&lt;/a&gt; a national hepatitis B vaccination effort since 2002, achieving coverage as &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/hepatitis-b-vaccination-coverage?CODE=GHA&amp;amp;ANTIGEN=&amp;amp;YEAR=" target="_blank"&gt;high&lt;/a&gt; as 95% — just not with the newborn vaccine that matters most. The vaccine currently used, which protects against hepatitis B and four other infections, is called the pentavalent vaccine and is free to all citizens. It's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2025-113229" target="_blank"&gt;first given&lt;/a&gt; at about one month of age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that's often too late to prevent infection, which typically occurs during birth or in the uterus. Studies estimate that even a seven-day delay in vaccination can &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/server/api/core/bitstreams/c55eb2dd-3b78-452d-b93c-a4471b2bdfed/content" target="_blank"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; the risk of infection ninefold.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That baby has to be protected right when they're born," says Dr. Yvonne Ayerki Nartey, a physician based in Cape Coast, Ghana, who &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-african-scholars-in-global-health-sash-scholars/" target="_blank"&gt;conducts&lt;/a&gt; research with So. "We don't want to leave that gap open."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While researchers agree that the pentavalent vaccine is somewhat helpful in reducing transmission, it's nowhere close to perfect. For instance, more than half of children with hepatitis B had received the three-dose pentavalent series yet still got infected, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.03.049" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to a study from Sierra Leone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, it's not safe to give the pentavalent vaccine at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The only other available intervention for little ones is a shot of concentrated hepatitis B antibodies that gives the baby instant protection, &lt;a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(23)02173-7/pdf" target="_blank"&gt;temporarily&lt;/a&gt;, with a quarter of infants eventually becoming infected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that shot costs patients about $50 because health programs don't widely cover it, according to Adjei, who works with hepatitis patients. That's an insurmountable expense for Ghanaians who &lt;a href="https://statsghana.gov.gh/gssmain/fileUpload/pressrelease/Earnings%20Inequality%20Report%2014-02-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;earn&lt;/a&gt; an average of $240 per month.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Complicating matters, many mothers &lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/sites/default/files/content/national_profiles/files/2025-06/2025-05-30_Ghana_National%20Hepatitis%20Elimination%20Profile.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;don't even know&lt;/a&gt; they're infected because testing is hard to come by, and hepatitis B sometimes causes no symptoms. Even when testing is available, some pregnant women, Adjei says, are forced to pay for the service, which is supposed to be free.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Ghana's uphill battle to give all babies a poke&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent years, Ghana's economy has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-27/ghana-s-economic-woes-far-worse-than-anticipated-mahama-says" target="_blank"&gt;struggled&lt;/a&gt; with rampant inflation and debt, squeezing its health budget. The country has &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS?locations=GH&amp;amp;most_recent_value_desc=false" target="_blank"&gt;one of the lowest&lt;/a&gt; levels of health spending as a share of GDP worldwide — &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD?locations=GH" target="_blank"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; $82 per person.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those few dollars that are available for health spending weren't enough to cover the cost of a newborn vaccination program for hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We haven't taken that bold step yet," Adjei says. "The reality is, until Gavi comes in, forget it, you won't have the budgetary support."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gavi, the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank"&gt;organization that funds immunizations&lt;/a&gt; for lower-income countries, &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/programmes-impact/country-hub/africa/ghana" target="_blank"&gt;helps Ghana fund&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/types-support/vaccine-support/pentavalent" target="_blank"&gt;pentavalent vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. However, the newborn vaccine was never funded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's because Gavi co-finances vaccines, a process where countries are generally asked to &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/%20/board/minutes/2025/24-25-july06%20-%20Annex%20B%20-%20Co-financing%20Policy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;pay&lt;/a&gt; at least 20 cents per dose, and Gavi covers the rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the newborn vaccine once cost just 20 cents, meaning countries would've &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/hepatitis-b-vaccine-birth-gavi-responds-msf" target="_blank"&gt;had to pay&lt;/a&gt; the full price regardless — without any aid from Gavi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The organization put the vaccine on hold, and Ghana was left to fend for itself. By 2014, Gavi &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/hepatitis-b-vaccine-birth-gavi-responds-msf" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it would "focus its limited resources on other high-impact vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Without Gavi's negotiating power, the shot would cost patients $3.50 per dose, according to Adjei. As a result, the free pentavalent shot &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/programmes-impact/country-hub/africa/ghana" target="_blank"&gt;remained&lt;/a&gt; the standard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Implementing the newborn vaccine would also be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00720-8" target="_blank"&gt;logistically challenging&lt;/a&gt;. The poke has to be given to babies within 24 hours of birth, but in Ghana, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10360654/table/T1/" target="_blank"&gt;more than&lt;/a&gt; one-fifth of births happen &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03989-x" target="_blank"&gt;outside the hospital&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These challenges didn't stop groups from &lt;a href="https://msfaccess.org/sites/default/files/2018-05/June.2014_GAVI%20missed%20opportunity%20letter%20to%20Dr%20Berkley.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;publicly pressuring&lt;/a&gt; Gavi, though.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We started amplifying our voices to get this on the priority list," Adjei recalls, noting his organization's advocacy efforts were launched in 2015. "We started making noise."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Enter Rap Doctor&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The public push in Ghana also involved an unlikely character: a famous rapper.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kwame Nsiah-Apau, who goes by his stage names Okyeame Kwame and Rap Doctor, has captivated Ghanaian audiences for nearly three decades with his &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2007/07/31/12382547/vintage-highlife-and-afrobeat-on-bokoor-beats" target="_blank"&gt;"hiplife" style&lt;/a&gt; of music. For much of that time, he has also been a &lt;a href="https://okyeamekwamefoundation.org/" target="_blank"&gt;vocal advocate&lt;/a&gt; for people living with hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The 49-year-old partnered with groups to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwcZeYhxiZE" target="_blank"&gt;raise awareness&lt;/a&gt; about the plight of hepatitis B patients and the stigma they face. He says he often visits college campuses to promote the vaccine and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/OkyeameK/videos/world-hep-day-prep/1050340160553665/" target="_blank"&gt;sat down&lt;/a&gt; with vaccine researchers at the University of Ghana in July.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a coalition of people working together," he says. "We curate one message and keep pushing it so that we will be able to achieve our goal. We must all hold hands and push hepatitis into the deep blue ocean."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The noise they made eventually reached Gavi. By 2018, the organization's board &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/our-alliance/strategy/vaccine-investment-strategy-2018" target="_blank"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; to start supporting hepatitis B birth doses in 2021. But yet another setback — the pandemic — &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230124172610/https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/5936/file/Gavi-Alliance-update-Hein-VIC-2020.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;stalled&lt;/a&gt; those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was silent for a while," Adjei, who leads a hepatitis advocacy group, recalls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The activist, who was drawn to the field after seeing the impact of the virus on pregnant women, started working with hepatitis B patients nearly two decades ago. Adjei says he began by administering shots. Each shot he gave was meticulously noted in a notebook. "Whenever I looked at that book, I could see the number of lives that I could save," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus continued to spread, and Ghana's Ministry of Health &lt;a href="https://www.moh.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2022-Holistic-Assessment-Report_FINAL31.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;rated&lt;/a&gt; its performance at keeping the virus at bay as "poor" in a report published in 2023. Adjei kept &lt;a href="https://www.moh.gov.gh/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2016-Annual-Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;pushing&lt;/a&gt;, and it didn't take long to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(22)00422-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;reenergize&lt;/a&gt; public pressure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The news finally came in 2024, when Gavi announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.worldhepatitisalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Gavi-Community-Briefing_Final.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;help cover&lt;/a&gt; the cost of newborn vaccines, providing a framework for Ghana to co-purchase mass quantities of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Roadblocks ahead &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the announcement, Adjei says the Ghanaian government's push to make the immunization campaign official didn't come until last year, when the government &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/GHSofficial1/posts/hepatitis-b-remains-a-major-public-health-concern-especially-with-the-risk-of-mo/1292585782872146" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/VtcH9fF8Sic?si=CaJ3XH8Q7etR0SIc&amp;amp;t=5027" target="_blank"&gt;would&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/1397735/ghana-secures-gavi-approval-for-hepatitis-b-birth.html" target="_blank"&gt;introduce&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine in September and &lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/sites/default/files/content/national_profiles/files/2025-06/2025-05-30_Ghana_National%20Hepatitis%20Elimination%20Profile.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;receive help&lt;/a&gt; from partners to facilitate the new program.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But September came and went — and the rollout never did. An official from the Ghana Health Service declined to speak with NPR for this story.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though Adjei says he's "sure" the campaign will launch in 2026, uncertainty remains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It was very unpleasant, and at a point it was very irritating, especially when you have the figures and you're showing how many people are dying as a result of a vaccine-preventable condition," Adjei says. "You keep on &lt;a href="https://www.globalhep.org/birth-dose-advocacy-hepatitis-foundation-ghana" target="_blank"&gt;reminding&lt;/a&gt; the government almost every day about the need to have this on the priority table. Obviously, at some point, we were just exhausted — even mad."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been a very, very, very long fight. They just keep on assuring us that it will happen very soon. It's an unending battle, but we are sure and optimistic that one day it will be over."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nsiah-Apau shares that sense of hope. He says he's even ready for the call — the one when the government calls on him to help out with the new campaign.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Nartey, the doctor who treats patients with hepatitis, warns that even countries that have rolled out national birth-dose programs continue to struggle. Even those 14 countries in sub-Saharan Africa — &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.supp.2017.27.3.11981" target="_blank"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; the Gambia and Nigeria — have reached birth dose coverage rates of only about 17%, according to a report &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2025-113229" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another worry hovering over Adjei is Gavi's future. With funding dollars &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank"&gt;already cut&lt;/a&gt;, he worries the newborn hepatitis B vaccine might be on the chopping block. Gavi, though, is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank"&gt;thinking ahead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adjei is too, and he says his global community of hepatitis advocates keeps him going. "Even though they are not in Africa, they still extend their helping hand."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nartey continues to see those glimmers of hope and tries to imagine a Ghana that will &lt;a href="https://www.modernghana.com/news/1396559/a-hepatitis-b-free-future-looms-for-ghana.html" target="_blank"&gt;one day&lt;/a&gt; be hepatitis B-free.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a good feeling to see that you are doing something to try to reduce the burden of the largest cause of cancer mortality in your country," Nartey says. "I see their future when I see that they've been vaccinated. At least I know that they're not going to die."&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;If you’ve been sick with a nasty respiratory virus in the past few weeks, or know someone who is, you’re not alone. In the last week of 2025, Kansas City saw its &lt;a href="https://www.kcmo.gov/Home/Components/News/News/2832/16" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fourth-highest weekly total&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; influenza cases in the past 15 years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this surge has not yet reached its peak and will continue for a few more weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surge has been dominated by a strain of the Influenza A type virus known as Subclade K, which medical professionals are calling a “super flu.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical staff at the University of Kansas Health System recommend getting the flu vaccine if you haven’t yet, even though it is not an exact match to this variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Chief Medical Officer Dr. Steve Stites, the influenza vaccine typically  ffers about a 70% to 80% reduction in the chance of severe illness and hospitalization. For this strain, it offers about 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination still works. Maybe not quite as well, but it’s still one of your best lines of defense,” Stites said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical Director of Infection Prevention and Control Dr. Dana Hawkinson says vaccines are not meant to protect from infection, but to decrease the chances of the complications that come with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vaccine continues to do that, even though it’s not the best match this year,” Hawkinson said. “You will have that immune response there to help reduce the risk of those complications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the 2024-2025 flu season, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/1476/Influenza-Surveillance" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kansas identified 182 deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; directly caused by the flu, and another 45 with influenza as a contributing factor. Missouri identified 408 deaths total with influenza as a direct or contributing cause during the last flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkinson says if you have not yet contracted the virus, you can still get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It does take seven, 10, 14 days to mount that immune response, but we still have a long way to go in influenza season and other variants or other types can come through as well,” Hawkinson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of infection, Hawkinson urges people frequently wash or sanitize their hands and wear a mask when in public. If possible, stay at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that there are real-world problems, bills to pay, work to get to, school, all of those things,” said Hawkinson. “We’re just trying to give that message and the recommendations to help keep everybody in the households, especially those high-risk people, and our community safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sean Kumer, Chief Medical Officer of the Kansas City Division of the medical system, says hospitals in the metro are seeing more people check in with influenza and more staff come down with the flu, putting a strain on staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s two sides to this. It’s about the patient and it’s about the people taking care of the patient,” said Kumer. “And that's what we're kind of working through right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumer says medical staff are now wearing masks in the inpatient wards and in the clinic to protect the patients who aren’t yet infected, as well as the staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges hospitals are facing, Dr. Stites urges anyone who feels like they are getting sick to seek medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you feel like that disease is beginning to get out of control, don’t sit at home. Get to your providers. Get to the emergency room,” Stites said. “Let people know that you’re having a problem and let us help get you into the right place.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The federal government has drastically scaled back the number of recommended childhood immunizations, sidelining six routine vaccines that have safeguarded millions from serious diseases, long-term disability, and death.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Just three of the six immunizations the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it will no longer routinely recommend — against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and rotavirus — have prevented nearly 2 million hospitalizations and more than 90,000 deaths in the past 30 years, according to&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11309373/" target="_blank"&gt; the CDC's own publications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccines against the three diseases, as well as those against respiratory syncytial virus, meningococcal disease, flu, and COVID, are now recommended only for children at high risk of serious illness or after "shared clinical decision-making," or consultation between doctors and parents.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC maintained its recommendations for 11 childhood vaccines: measles, mumps, and rubella; whooping cough, tetanus, and diphtheria; the bacterial disease known as Hib; pneumonia; polio; chickenpox; and human papillomavirus, or HPV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Federal and private insurance will still cover vaccines for the diseases the CDC no longer recommends universally, according to a Department of Health and Human Services&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/fact-sheet-cdc-childhood-immunization-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt; fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;; parents who want to vaccinate their children against those diseases will not have to pay out-of-pocket.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experts on childhood disease were baffled by the change in guidance. HHS said the changes followed "a scientific review of the underlying science" and were in line with vaccination programs in other developed nations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, pointed to Denmark as a model. But the schedules of most European countries are closer to the U.S. standard upended by the new guidance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, Denmark, which does not vaccinate against rotavirus, registers around 1,200 infant and toddler rotavirus hospitalizations a year. That rate, in a country of 6 million, is about the same as it was in the United States before vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're OK with having 1,200 or 1,300 hospitalized kids, which is the tip of the iceberg in terms of childhood suffering," said Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a co-inventor of a licensed rotavirus vaccine. "We weren't. They should be trying to emulate us, not the other way around."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Public health officials say the new guidance puts the onus on parents to research and understand each childhood vaccine and why it is important.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Here's a rundown of the diseases the sidelined vaccines prevent:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSV.&lt;/strong&gt; Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The respiratory virus usually spreads in fall and winter and produces cold-like symptoms, though it can be deadly for young children, causing tens of thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of deaths a year. According to the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, roughly 80% of children younger than 2 who are hospitalized with RSV have no identifiable risk factors. Long-awaited vaccines against the disease were introduced in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis A.&lt;/strong&gt; Hepatitis A vaccination, which was phased in beginning in the late 1990s and recommended for all toddlers starting in 2006, has led to a more than 90% drop in the disease since 1996. The foodborne virus, which causes a wretched illness, continues to plague adults, particularly people who are homeless or who abuse drugs or alcohol, with&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2023/hepatitis-a/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; a total&lt;/a&gt; of 1,648 cases and 85 deaths reported in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis B.&lt;/strong&gt; The disease causes liver cancer, cirrhosis, and other serious illnesses and is&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/hepatitis-b-kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-children-cdc-acip/" target="_blank"&gt; particularly dangerous&lt;/a&gt; when contracted by babies and young children. The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and other bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and can survive on surfaces for a week. From 1990 to 2019, vaccination resulted in a 99% decline in reported cases of acute hepatitis B among children and teens. Liver cancer among American children has also plummeted as a result of universal childhood vaccination. But the hepatitis B virus is still around, with 2,000-3,000 acute cases reported annually among unvaccinated adults. More than 17,000 chronic hepatitis B diagnoses were reported in 2023. The CDC estimates about half of people infected don't know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rotavirus.&lt;/strong&gt; Before routine administration of the current rotavirus vaccines began in 2006, about 70,000 young children were hospitalized and 50 died every year from the virus. It was known as "winter vomiting syndrome," said Sean O'Leary, a pediatrician at the University of Colorado. "It was a miserable disease that we hardly see anymore."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The virus is still common on surfaces that babies touch, however, and "if you lower immunization rates it will once again hospitalize children," Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meningococcal vaccines.&lt;/strong&gt; These have been required mainly for teenagers and college students, who are notably vulnerable to critical illness caused by the bacteria. About 600 to 1,000 cases of meningococcal disease are reported in the U.S. each year, but it kills more than 10% of those it sickens, and 1 in 5 survivors have permanent disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flu and covid.&lt;/strong&gt; The two respiratory viruses have each killed hundreds of children in recent years — though both tend to be much more severe in older adults. Flu is currently on the upswing in the United States, and last flu season the virus killed 289 children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is shared clinical decision-making?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Under the changes, decisions about vaccinating children against influenza, covid, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, and hepatitis A and B will now rely on what officials call "shared clinical decision-making," meaning families will have to consult with a health care provider to determine whether a vaccine is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It means a provider should have a conversation with the patient to lay out the risks and the benefits and make a decision for that individual person," said&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/handy-lori" target="_blank"&gt; Lori Handy&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the past, the CDC used that term only in reference to narrow circumstances, like whether a person in a monogamous relationship needed the HPV vaccine, which prevents a sexually transmitted infection and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's new approach doesn't line up with the science because of the proven protective benefit the vaccines have for the vast majority of the population, Handy said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In their report justifying the changes, HHS officials Tracy Beth Høeg and Martin Kulldorff said the U.S. vaccination system requires more safety research and more parental choice. Eroding trust in public health caused in part by an overly large vaccine schedule had led more parents to shun vaccination against major threats like measles, they said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The vaccines on the schedule that the CDC has altered were backed up by extensive safety research when they were evaluated and approved by the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're held to a safety standard higher than any other medical intervention that we have," Handy said. "The value of routine recommendations is that it really helps the public understand that this has been vetted upside down and backwards in every which way."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eric Ball, a pediatrician in Orange County, Calif., said the change in guidance will cause more confusion among parents who think it means a vaccine's safety is in question.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is critical for public health that recommendations for vaccines are very clear and concise," &lt;a href="https://choc.org/medical-staff/pediatrics/eric-ball-md/" target="_blank"&gt;Ball&lt;/a&gt; said. "Anything to muddy the water is just going to lead to more children getting sick."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ball said that instead of focusing on a child's individual health needs, he often has to spend limited clinic time reassuring parents that vaccines are safe. A "shared clinical decision-making" status for a vaccine has no relationship to safety concerns, but parents may think it does.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS' changes do not affect state vaccination laws and therefore should allow prudent medical practitioners to carry on as before, said&lt;a href="https://www.law.gwu.edu/richard-hughes-iv" target="_blank"&gt; Richard Hughes IV&lt;/a&gt;, an attorney and a George Washington University lecturer who is leading litigation against Kennedy over vaccine changes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You could expect that any pediatrician is going to follow sound evidence and recommend that their patients be vaccinated," he said. The law protects providers who follow professional care guidelines, he said, and "RSV, meningococcal, and hepatitis remain serious health threats for children in this country."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story comes from NPR's health reporting partnership with&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

            After a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/flu-highest-level-25-years"&gt;record week&lt;/a&gt; of flu activity in the US, hospitalizations and deaths continue to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg8800053b6sxa7bg8h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 40,000 people were admitted to the hospital with flu during the week ending January 3, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-53.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ​about 10% more than the ​36,600 hospitalizations in the week before. Overall, there were about 12 flu hospitalizations for every 100,000 people in the US last week, CDC data shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg8800063b6stdd0znqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seniors are most likely to be hospitalized with flu, but rates among children are also high. At least 17 children have died from the flu this season, the CDC says – a number that nearly doubled over the past week, with eight new deaths reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg8800073b6sbszs32c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Four of the pediatric flu deaths this season have been in Massachusetts, including two children in Boston who were under the age of 2.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg8800083b6slgzk0fqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Flu cases are surging in Boston, and we are seeing an uptick in serious cases involving children, including the tragic deaths of two very young children,” Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the city’s commissioner of public health, said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk79bmgy00033b6t6wzmrlgt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the flu is usually mild, it can cause hospitalization and death. Children under the age of two are at higher risk. Parents should get their children ages six months and older vaccinated as soon as possible to decrease the risk of severe complications. Parents should seek immediate medical attention if their child has flu symptoms and also has signs of more severe illness, like trouble breathing, decreased urination, persistently high fever or becomes extremely lethargic and difficult to arouse.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg8800093b6sfpz8rdrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, the CDC estimates that there have been at least 15 million illnesses, 180,000 hospitalizations and 7,400 deaths from flu this season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg88000a3b6sqrft794n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu activity “remains elevated across the country,” and the CDC says it expects that to continue for several more weeks. More than a dozen states have flu activity levels in the highest category that the agency tracks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg88000b3b6sqhzbuqgy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC surveillance data published last week showed that flu-like activity in the US had reached the highest level on record since the agency started tracking about 30 years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg88000c3b6s4s6xqoss@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, some of those indicators have fallen, but the CDC says that does not necessarily mean the season has reached its peak. Instead, the downtick “could be due to changes in healthcare seeking or reporting during the holidays,” and more increases may come in the weeks ahead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg88000d3b6snm2zvkwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Influenza A(H3N2) viruses are the most commonly reported, and additional genetic testing suggests that a new variant — called subclade K — that caused early and busy flu seasons in other part of the world continues to be driving the vast majority of cases in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg88000e3b6spxgstdl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccination “has been shown to reduce the risk of flu and its potentially serious complications,” the CDC says. But only about 130 million doses of vaccine have been distributed nationwide this season, enough to cover less than 40% of the US population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk78pg88000f3b6stzcszdul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Earlier this week, the US Department of Health and Human Services overhauled the childhood vaccine schedule, including an updated recommendation that decisions on vaccinations against flu be based on “shared clinical decision-making,” which means people who want one must consult with a health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk79gk2v00053b6ta0eh952l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many state health departments have broken with these updated recommendations, instead supporting recommendations from professional medical associations — such as the American Academy of Pediatrics — that continue to broadly support flu vaccination for everyone 6 months and older.

Oxford researchers noted that weight was regained at a faster rate than among those who ended behavioral weight loss programs supported by diet and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiometabolic markers — including blood pressure and cholesterol — also returned to baseline levels about 16 months after stopping GLP-1 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/health-care/us-regulators-approve-wegovy-pill-for-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;b&gt;US regulators approve Wegovy pill for weight loss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that patients who wish to maintain weight loss may need to continue taking the medication long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t a failing of the medicines — it reflects the nature of obesity as a chronic, relapsing condition,” said Dr. Sam West, a University of Oxford researcher. “It sounds a cautionary note for short-term use without a more comprehensive approach to weight management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research comes as insurers and government health services debate whether to cover GLP-1 drugs for weight loss. The medicines were originally developed to treat diabetes but have since been approved for obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to helping people with diabetes control symptoms, drugmakers say GLP-1 medicines improve cardiometabolic markers in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the drugs are expensive, often costing more than $1,000 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/health-care/trump-announces-effort-to-lower-cost-and-expand-coverage-for-weight-loss-drugs"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trump announces effort to lower cost and expand coverage for weight-loss drugs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Cleveland Clinic, the medications manage blood sugar by triggering insulin release from the pancreas and slowing digestion, which reduces the amount of glucose entering the bloodstream. They also help patients feel full after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Jebb, a professor of diet and population health at Oxford, said the findings highlight “the need for a more holistic and long-term approach to weight management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obesity is a chronic, relapsing condition, not a short-term problem with a quick fix,” Jebb said. “When people lose weight through changes to their diet and activity, they’re practicing the skills that help maintain that loss. It may be that with medication, the weight comes off without necessarily developing those skills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk718jjz003t26qocmcx55x2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers came to Dr. Chris Knowles’ school in England when he was 18 years old to run an experiment. They wanted to see which novice drinkers responded the most to alcohol and who would later go on to develop a drinking problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v00083b6pr9x2rouf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They placed two double vodkas in front of each student to measure their reaction, he recalled. Knowles downed his and then reached over and drank the two belonging to a girl next to him, who didn’t care much for liquor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000a3b6ppd3pn908@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Knowles, now a professor of surgery at Queen Mary University of London and author of a new book on the science of excessive drinking, said he later went on to seek treatment for alcohol use disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000b3b6pz4fl5yas@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Research has shown no amount of alcohol is good for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/health/no-alcohol-good-for-heart-wellness"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/health/alcohol-dementia-risk-study-wellness"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;. Despite those findings, and often personal consequences for some drinkers, excessive alcohol use is fairly common, with 17% of adults in the United States reporting binge drinking, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/excessive-drinking-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000c3b6pzuat8243@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Describing his time drinking as 10 years of fun, then 10 years of fun with negative consequences and another 10 years of only negative consequences, Knowles has investigated alcohol’s appeal in his new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Drink-Too-Much/dp/1250392926" target="_blank"&gt;Why We Drink Too Much&lt;/a&gt;: The Impact of Alcohol on Our Bodies and Culture.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000d3b6p0vit8o5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The short answer to why humans drink? “Because it’s fun and because we learn that good things happen when we do it, or at least we think good things have happened when we did it,” Knowles said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000e3b6ps2db4w04@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The long answer offers insight into why some people struggle more than others and why they keep drinking, even when it becomes clear good things aren’t happening.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000f3b6pjqz90vqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When he thinks back to friends from his early drinking days, plenty of them drank less than he did –– but he also knew some who drank a great deal more than he did and didn’t develop any problems, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000g3b6p6qdrworr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The same might be true of your friend group. There isn’t always a direct correlation between those who drink the most and those who will have a problem, Knowles said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000h3b6p52vtfcr9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How much someone drinks and the relationship a person has with alcohol comes down to many factors, including environment, biology and psychology, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000i3b6pggb75hyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alcohol stimulates some of the same pleasure centers of the brain as those that give a feeling of reward when you seek out necessities such as food and relationships, Knowles said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000j3b6p7ry4gegw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But alcohol also works on the negative side, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000k3b6p9qlb19bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The more you drink, the more you drive those stress neurotransmitters, and so you’re miserable when you’re not drinking,” said Dr. George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000l3b6puow5frpi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re really digging that hole, and you’re drinking to fill the hole. But unfortunately, every time you try to fill the hole by drinking, you’re making the hole deeper.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000m3b6pjugsfl91@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When talking about biological factors behind excessive use of alcohol, it is easy to assume that some people are just physiologically wired to take a drink and have their brain say, “More, now” –– like young Knowles with vodka. And there is truth to such thinking because some people’s physiology will just agree more with alcohol, said Dr. Danielle Dick, director of the Rutgers Addiction Research Center and a professor of psychiatry at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8v000n3b6p565jb8st@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that physiological factor isn’t the whole story, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000o3b6pib7yn0s2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A major part of the biology behind who develops problematic use of alcohol has to do with how an individual’s brain is wired to process rewards and risk, Dick said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000p3b6p6cnrmoui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alcohol use is rewarding in the brain, and when a brain is wired to seek out a lot of reward and worry less about risks, such a person is more likely to fall into a pattern of wanting to use more and more, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000q3b6p34q8deu8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Humans also tend to drink –– especially past the point in which they feel good –– because of psychological factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000r3b6pv2wnwk0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People with conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolarity, schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress disorder are at particularly high risk for substance abuse, Knowles said. But psychological traits such as neuroticism, low self-esteem, anxiety and depression also increase risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000s3b6puoql0m9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People who only drink for fun are not likely to develop a dependency, Knowles said. It doesn’t mean that binge drinking at parties won’t lead to health problems down the road, just that the reasons people drink when they do can make a big difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000t3b6pg0wc54fs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yes, some people just drink to enjoy, but many also consume alcohol to experience a boost in confidence or performance or to relieve stress, sadness or difficult memories, Knowles said. Those additional motivations can work against you, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000u3b6pj99r92um@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s an old adage, ‘If drinking is a problem, you’re in with a chance. If it’s your solution, you’ve already lost,’” Knowles said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000v3b6p9498v3vj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are experiencing difficulty and alcohol feels like it turns on a light and allows you to escape that hardship, drinking is a hard thing to turn away from –– even if you are starting to see that it isn’t helping like you had hoped, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000w3b6pcsptdvqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Compounding the problem is the development of a tolerance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000x3b6p815113ho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your tolerance isn’t just the number of drinks you can have and still hold a conversation or walk in a straight line. It is also how many drinks you need to have before you get the same good feeling or relief from bad ones, Koob said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000y3b6pqdo55j7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The more you drink, the more you need to keep drinking to get the same effect, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w000z3b6p0u67f38o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There aren’t just two types of drinkers –– those who have a problem and those who don’t have to worry about it, Dick said. It is a continuum.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00103b6pkjafagek@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On one side, there are those who don’t drink at all, those who may drink sometimes but don’t particularly like it, and those who drink but in a way that feels healthy and manageable. On the other side of the continuum are people who are considered to have a clinical alcohol use disorder, which can be mild, moderate or severe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00113b6plgc8jh1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorder include factors such as continuing to drink even though it is affecting your job or family, getting into dangerous situations and having withdrawal symptoms, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00123b6p7wf8shwe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the middle are those who call themselves gray area drinkers, Knowles said. It isn’t a medical definition but rather an acknowledgement of unhealthy drinking patterns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00133b6pe2nw33j4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They haven’t had issues at work because of their drinking, haven’t lost relationships or suffered health issues yet. But they may not be performing at their best, feeling present with their kids or dealing with stress or hardships effectively, Knowles said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00143b6pf8sdrkhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cutting back no matter what level of drinking you are at can have health benefits, Dick said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00153b6piucdroj5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A change in a relationship with alcohol should start with a period of abstinence, Knowles said. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/01/health/dry-january-tips-wellness"&gt;Challenges such as a Dry January&lt;/a&gt; are a good opportunity to take a step back and break down the role alcohol plays in your life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00163b6pe3pcq11d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From there, it is important to educate yourself on the pros and cons of drinking, find a way to engage in support and community that doesn’t center around alcohol, and learn to address the psychological problems that alcohol may have suppressed, Knowles said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00173b6pj3qkal8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those gray area drinkers, that can mean reading books on drinking and sobriety, addressing underlying stresses and finding new ways to socialize.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00183b6pd11ziygk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although it feels like alcohol is a part of everything, in general, people are drinking less than they did in earlier generations, especially younger ones, Dick said. And with that decline has come a rise in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/health-fitness/best-non-alcoholic-wines?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=mainsite&amp;amp;utm_id=features"&gt;mocktail and nonalcoholic drink culture&lt;/a&gt;. Finding those alternatives can be a good way to engage in social routines without grabbing an alcoholic drink, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w00193b6prk9xphdx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who have clinical alcohol use disorder, support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous, treatment centers and medical detox resources may be crucial.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w001a3b6pg6v84fzs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            The key, however, is to readjust how your brain gets rewards and deal with the stress that might motivate alcohol use, not just to try to cut back on drinking, Knowles said.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk71db8w001c3b6pp7u5q36y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to maintaining sobriety, “most people who are proudly showing you their 35-year pin are going to tell you it’s a lifelong effort,” Koob said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It means nothing, standardized effect sizes have no clinical meaning here, they are purely statistical. To measure if these kinds of changes matter, you need to determine the Minimal (Clinically) Important Difference [1-2]. I.e. can clinicians (or patients) even notice the observed statistical difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this is a change of about 3-5 points on most 20+ item rating scales, or a relative reduction of 20-30% of the total (sum) score of the scale [1-2]. Unfortunately, anti-depressants are under or just barely reach this threshold [3-4], and so should be widely to be considered ineffective or only borderline effective, on average. Of course this is complicated by the fact that some people get worse on these treatments, and some people experience &lt;i&gt;dramatic&lt;/i&gt; improvements, but, still, the point is, depression is extremely hard to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this also means that if exercise is only &lt;i&gt;nearly&lt;/i&gt; as effective as therapy for depression, it may mean that the benefits of exercise are not actually really clinically observable, if measured properly and not just based on arbitrary statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: There is less data on MCIDs for therapy, but at least one review suggests therapy effects can be in the 10+ point range [5]. But the way the exercise study is presented, with standardized effect sizes, we have no idea if the results matter at all [6].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] Button, et al. (2015).

&lt;div class="comment"&gt;&lt;div class="commtext c00"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, if exercise is only &lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;nearly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt; as effective as therapy for depression, it &lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt; mean that the benefits of exercise are not actually really clinically observable, if measured properly and not just based on arbitrary statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardized effect sizes like the ones reported here have no clinical meaning, they are purely statistical. To measure if these kinds of changes matter, you need to determine the Minimal (Clinically) Important Difference [1-2]. I.e. can clinicians (or patients) even notice the observed statistical difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, this is a change of about 3-5 points on most 20+ item rating scales, or a relative reduction of 20-30% of the total (sum) score of the scale [1-2]. Unfortunately, anti-depressants are under or just barely reach this threshold [3-4], and so should be widely to be considered ineffective or only borderline effective, on average. Of course this is complicated by the fact that some people get worse on these treatments, and some people experience &lt;i&gt;dramatic&lt;/i&gt; improvements, but, still, the point is, depression is extremely hard to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDIT: There is less data on MCIDs for therapy, but at least one review suggests therapy effects can be in the 10+ point range [5]. But the way the exercise study is presented, with a standardized effect size, we  can have no idea if the results matter at all [6].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] Button, et al. (2015).

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE — Health officials in Snohomish and King counties confirmed three &lt;a href="https://www.snohd.org/460/Measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles &lt;/a&gt;cases among a South Carolina family that visited over the recent holiday period. They warn the family visited several public locations where others may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infected family — one adult and two children — visited numerous sites across Marysville, Mukilteo and Everett between Dec. 27 and Jan. 1 while contagious but undiagnosed. The parent had received at least one measles vaccine, while the children were unvaccinated, according to the Snohomish County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the public exposure sites health officials have identified:  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;McDonald's at 530 128th Street in Everett on Dec. 27 from 1-3 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slavic Christian Church Awakening in Mukilteo on Dec. 28 from 2-6:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flying Squirrel Trampoline Park in the Everett Mall on Dec. 29 from 11 a.m.- 2p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chick-fil-A at 8110 36th Ave in Marysville on Dec. 29 from 1-3 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mukilteo-Clinton Ferry on Dec. 30 from 1-3 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fisherman Jack's at 1410 Seiner Drive in Everett on Dec. 30 from 6-9:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consolidated Rental Car Facility and shuttles to/from the airport on Jan. 1 from 6:45-9 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SEA Airport N Concourse (Gate N4) and Green Line Train on Jan. 1 from 7-11:15 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said anyone at the exposure locations should verify their vaccination status. The MMR vaccine provides about 97% protection with two doses, which last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone exposed between Dec. 27 and Jan. 1 who lack immunity could develop symptoms between Jan. 4 and Jan. 22. Those who are immunocompromised may take longer to experience symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People experiencing fever or unexplained rash should call a healthcare provider before visiting a medical facility to avoid spreading the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is one of the most contagious diseases we know, and often brings serious illness," said Dr. James Lewis, Snohomish County health officer. "The MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent outbreaks and protect our community, especially for infants and those who cannot be vaccinated."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases have surged nationwide, with 2,144 reported in 2025 — the highest level since 1992, health officials said. South Carolina health officials reported 26 new cases since Friday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly contagious virus spreads through the air and can remain infectious for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area. Symptoms include fever, rash, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Up to 90% of unprotected people near an infected individual will contract the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can include ear infections, pneumonia and, rarely, brain inflammation or death. High-risk groups include children under 5, adults over 20, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Food poisoning is never a fun experience. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll bite into something bad and realize soon enough to spit it out. Other times, you’ll only realize your mistake much later. Once the tainted food gets far enough into the digestive system, it’s too late. Your only option is to strap in for the ride as the body voids the toxins or pathogens by every means available, perhaps for several consecutive days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper food storage and preparation are the key ways we avoid food poisoning today. However, a new development could give us a further tool in the fight—with scientists finding a way &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/thwart-food-poisoning-tiny-needles-could-inject-bacteria-slaying-viruses-your-meal?utm_campaign=ScienceMagazine&amp;amp;utm_medium=ownedSocial&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank"&gt;to actively hunt down and destroy angry little pathogens before they can spoil a good meal.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-881295"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hunt Them Down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food poisoning cases tend to boil down to two categories—those involving toxins, and those involving bacterial pathogens. In either case, affected food must be destroyed. Particularly in the latter case, as bacteria reproduce—even the tiniest contamination will quickly spiral in size.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: research paper&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, new research published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx6918" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Advances &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;may have a solution to the problem of bacterial-based food poisoning. It involves using patches to deliver specially-crafted viruses to fight and kill the bacteria that would otherwise infect and sicken a human who eats the food. The patches are to be applied to the food itself—attacking and killing the bacteria before the food is eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The viruses in question are bacteriophages—specifically, viruses that can infect bacteria and reproduce within them from its own genetic material. When a bacteriaphage virus comes into contact with certain bacteria, it breaches the cell’s wall, typically with a syringe-like motion in which the viral genetic material is injected into the cell. Once inside, the genetic material is processed by the bacteria and reproduces more phages that can then go on to infect further bacteria. In the specific case of lytic phages, the bacterial cells are quickly destroyed as the virus reproduces inside, spreading the new phages quickly and killing the original host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two bacteriophages were used in this research. The T7 phage was chosen for its ability to infect and kill &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/em&gt;bacteria, which are a common foodborne pathogen. The &lt;em&gt;S.enterica &lt;/em&gt;phage was in turn chosen as it readily infects and kills &lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica &lt;/em&gt;bacteria, which are similarly a common cause of food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_881303" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-881303" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" data-attachment-id="881303" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2026/01/09/fighting-food-poisoning-with-a-patch/screenshot-2025-11-25-152016/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png" data-orig-size="1629,585" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Screenshot 2025-11-25 152016" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png?w=800" class="wp-image-881303 size-medium" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png?w=400" alt="" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png 1629w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png?resize=250,90 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png?resize=400,144 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png?resize=800,287 800w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-152016.png?resize=1536,552 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-881303" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The bacteriophages quickly destroy the infected bacteria while reproducing en masse within the cell. Credit: research paper&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the phages into food items, the research team developed a novel “patch” delivery system. This involved creating patches out of food-compatible polymers that were covered in tiny microneedles that could penetrate the surface of common foods. Once the microneedles penetrate the food, passing bacteria would interact with the bacteriophages, producing more phages as they burst open and die. This has the effect of propagating phages further to other bacteria in the food. The most successful microneedle patches were crafted out of PMMA polymer, after researchers investigated a wide range of other materials including PVA, PDMS, and gelatin. The microneedles are dosed with bacteriophages by simply incorporating the bacteriophage solution with a PMMA solution prior to casting in molds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patches proved effective in testing. One test involving contaminated cooked chicken saw 99.9% of &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;bacteria wiped out in the sample. A similar test on raw beef saw a similar reduction of &lt;em&gt;E.coli &lt;/em&gt;by 99%. These samples could effectively be considered decontaminated from the bacterial threat. The use of microneedles is key to the technique’s effectiveness. By penetrating up to a centimeter into the meat, it allows the bacteriophages to best get into contact with pathogens inside the food. In comparison, flat patches without needles performed less well, only reducing bacteria levels by three-quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research around using patches to deliver bacteriophages to food was only just published in October this year. However, the use of phages as a food safety measure actually goes back quite some time. The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2806%2902235-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;first approved the use of bacteriophage products in 2006&lt;/a&gt;, initially for killing bacteria in ready-to-eat poultry and meat products. The same techniques can be applied to all sorts of foods, though use thus far has been limited. The US has actually been a leader in approving these food treatment methods; as a contrast, the European Union is yet to approve any use of bacteriophage products for food use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to whether these patches could enter wider use, that remains to be seen. There are some limitations with the technique. For one, it involves punching many small holes in food, which isn’t super attractive to those going to eat it later. There are also concerns about the effectiveness of phages in real-world use, and whether it would be practical to dose patches with a wide range of phages to counter the many strains of foodborne pathogens out there. It also depends on the perception of the tecnnology—we’d all rather eat food free of bacteria, but whether we want to eat food that is full of viruses is another thing entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be a while before this technology reaches the mainstream food processing world, if it does at all. Regardless, the researchers can see a future where food packaging regularly includes a microneedle pad or membrane to take out any nasty bacteria before the product reaches the customer. That could promise to land better, safer food on our tables even if a few nasty bacteria did try to get involved in the action.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Talk about the souvenir from hell. A recent case report documents how a woman’s overseas trip to South America left her playing host to a worm parasite stuck in her eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in Chile and elsewhere &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/12/25-1126_article#;"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the eye-opening case last month in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 26-year-old UK resident developed a severe bout of conjunctivitis the scientists traced back to a wriggling adult &lt;em&gt;Philophthalmus lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; fluke—one she probably caught weeks earlier while visiting the Galápagos Islands off Ecuador. Though the worm was safely pulled out of the woman’s eye with no issue, more people in the area could be vulnerable to these infestations, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our clinical and epidemiologic findings show that the zoonotic eye fluke &lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; can infect humans in South America. The findings also suggest that the parasite might be endemic on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A fluke case&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman visited doctors in Santiago, Chile, nine days into having intense pain, swelling, and the sensation of feeling something moving in her right eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a thorough examination, the doctors spotted an “elongated mobile structure” in the conjunctiva of her eye (the thin, clear membrane that protects the eye). They then removed the foreign object by using a moist cotton swab, which relieved the unpleasant eye sensation. In the weeks after, she made a complete recovery with no complications.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors placed the eye intruder under a microscope and determined it was a &lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; fluke, which they further confirmed through genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/fluke-flatworm"&gt;Flukes&lt;/a&gt; are a class of parasitic flatworms formally known as trematodes. They have a complex life cycle that involves multiple hosts, which can include people. In people, fluke infections are typically grouped by where in the body the worms invade, such as the blood or liver. Eye fluke infections are primarily caused by &lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="eujQNb" data-processed="true"&gt;Philophthalmus &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;worms like &lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re only rarely reported. Since 1939, the researchers wrote, only 12 other cases of similar infections have been documented in the medical literature.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; worms have been found in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Their final, definitive hosts (the hosts where they reach maturity and mate) are waterbirds, and their intermediate hosts are marine snails. Sometimes, however, the worms can infect other vertebrates like mammals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A hidden endemic threat?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this specific case, the woman reported visiting Chile, Ecuador, and Peru prior to her symptoms starting. But the only time she was in a natural water environment was when she visited the Galápagos Islands. So that’s the most likely place where she contracted the infection, the doctors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exactly how it happened remains a mystery. Some case reports indicate that people can catch the infection through direct contact with larval cysts in the water while swimming, according to the researchers, yet others have linked infection to eating or handling food contaminated with the larva.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We know very little about these worms, including how many distinct species of &lt;i&gt;&lt;em class="eujQNb" data-processed="true"&gt;Philophthalmus&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/i&gt;there are in the world. And interestingly enough, the worm found in the woman’s eye bears a close resemblance to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16108555/"&gt;recently discovered species&lt;/a&gt; of fluke found in sea lions living near the Galápagos Islands called &lt;em&gt;P. zalophi&lt;/em&gt;. So close, in fact, it’s possible that &lt;em&gt;P. lacrymosus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;P. zalophi&lt;/em&gt; are the exact same species, the researchers argue. Flukes are known to physically adapt to their mammalian hosts, they note, which could explain why scientists might have mistakenly identified the sea lion worms as a new species.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However many kinds of these worms there are, it seems likely that some call the Galápagos Islands home. So more research needs to be done to better understand the ecology and host range of these flukes, the researchers say. And while human infections do seem to be rare, people who experience eye trouble after traveling to potentially endemic regions should at least be aware of the possibility, as should the doctors treating them.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The consequences for travelers and physicians attending them is that they should consider philophthalmiasis if people complain about a foreign body sensation during or after travel,” lead author Thomas Weitzel, a tropical medicine and parasitology expert at the Universidad del Desarrollo in Chile, told Gizmodo. “The treatment is the extraction of the worm which should be done by an ophthalmologist.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m just thrilled to know there are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/tag/eyeworms"&gt;even more awful things&lt;/a&gt; that can set up shop inside my juicy eyes if given the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

There are currently 200 people in quarantine, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The outbreak has been ongoing as state health officials continue to push for vaccinations. The majority of cases are located around Spartanburg County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The number of those in quarantine does not reflect the number actually exposed," Dr. Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist, said in a press releases. "An increasing number of public exposure sites are being identified with likely hundreds more people exposed who are not aware they should be in quarantine if they are not immune to measles. Previous measles transmission studies have shown that one measles case can result in up to 20 new infections among unvaccinated contacts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;South Carolina's department of public health said it sent a statewide health alert on Jan. 7, "advising health care providers and facilities of the importance of heightened awareness for measles and recommended measures for the use of masks and rapid isolation of suspect measles cases to protect people in health care settings from exposures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that people receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, CDC data shows vaccination rates have been lagging in recent years. During the 2024-2025 school year, 92.5% of kindergartners received the MMR vaccine, according to data. This is lower than the 92.7% seen the previous school year and the 95.2% seen in the 2019-2020 school year, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;ABC News' Mary Kekatos contributed reporting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>abcnews.go.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:17:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPaF9OTEZvVVBnVkd0VW10LXFtSDFGWEM0R3F0d2JxSGpocnBVWUF3MUNQQWJnX2syVXlZREFuRmZySXR3TVczQmw4ajNBYVFPSVFNbFRDMnJBWEFmbU9KRjNzSF9QZ0V0blZ2YmV0bmtQQy1feVFPV2tKTHNsNkpmT3RLOVo4MWxBdHlqZ0VSX2FjTmdIR2840gGcAUFVX3lxTE5KeTgxak50UjluQm9qdXA2b0NCeXlDNUxPTDdWVDYxZFgzd1huc2IxUWRTN0ZwNUMwZVY0MTVYN2dvX2dmS3BOSGJ6ZXBralVVcW9Vd1pyUy1tZDBjaTk1aTBQZEZXdEdSMjVDWHh3NkJzcEtkY042MU9FeFNaRDc3UEhPeWc5YWw3YVNIekpuUjhPUVlmV2ZxT3Zyeg</guid></item><item><title>核磁共振成像中的性行为：改变医学对人体的理解方式的实验- Ynetnews</title><link>https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/sjxjxor4wg</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-contents="true"&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="bpsdt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bpsdt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bpsdt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In 1991, a woman and her partner entered an MRI scanner and had sex in the name of science.

They happened to know the right people at the right time. Their close friend, Dutch scientist Menno Victor “Pek” van Andel, wanted to answer a basic question that had barely been studied: what the anatomy of sexual intercourse actually looks like from the inside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="8mc2j-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="8mc2j-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="8mc2j-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;He asked the couple to take part. To his surprise, they agreed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="cbm0k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cbm0k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cbm0k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Inside the narrow, noisy MRI scanner, the couple were instructed to maintain a fixed position while the system captured a series of relatively slow scans lasting several seconds each. The conditions were far from comfortable, but the results were clear. For the first time, medicine could observe in real time how sexual organs align and function during intercourse, documentation that had never previously existed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="7tup2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7tup2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7tup2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Following the initial experiment, researchers conducted a structured study that systematically examined the anatomy of sex using MRI technology. Volunteers aged 18 and older took part in 13 scans involving eight couples and three women, imaged both during intercourse and during sexual arousal without penetration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="bra2h-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bra2h-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bra2h-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;All scans were conducted in the missionary position, and participants were free to stop at any point. None did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="dub7g-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dub7g-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dub7g-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The findings, published in 1999 in the British Medical Journal, challenged a number of long-held medical assumptions. One central discovery overturned the centuries-old belief that the penis moves in and out of the vagina in a straight line, a depiction found in early anatomical illustrations, including a famous 1492 drawing by Leonardo da Vinci.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="f7r73-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f7r73-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f7r73-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The MRI images showed a very different reality. During erection, the penis curves inside the woman’s body and adapts to her anatomy in a natural motion that does not cause pain. Researchers likened the shape to a boomerang. They also discovered that about one-third of the penis consists of a “root” that remains inside the body even when flaccid, a fact previously unknown to medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="dapqq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dapqq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dapqq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Unexpected findings emerged regarding the female body as well. During sexual arousal without penetration, researchers observed the uterus shifting upward and the front wall of the vagina lengthening. Contrary to earlier theories, there was no increase in uterine volume. These observations contradicted classical anatomy textbooks and highlighted how much medical knowledge about female sexuality had long been based on assumptions rather than direct observation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="3rft6-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="ck6nq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="ck6nq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="ck6nq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Another surprising finding was that in all 13 cases, the woman’s bladder filled rapidly during intercourse. Researchers have yet to reach a definitive explanation. Van Andel suggested it may be “evolution’s way of encouraging women to urinate after sex to prevent urinary tract infections,” though he stressed this remains a theoretical idea without scientific proof.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="5ta4o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5ta4o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5ta4o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“In every final scan, we saw a large, full bladder, even though most women had used the restroom before entering the MRI,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="elmdg-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="elmdg-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="elmdg-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Although the article was published on Christmas Eve in 1999, when most researchers were on holiday, it became one of the most read and cited papers in the journal’s history. In 2019, 20 years after publication, BMJ editors singled it out as one of the most unusual and influential studies the journal had ever published.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="abtpl-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="abtpl-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="abtpl-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;More than 26 years later, the article is still read by thousands each month and remains among the most popular papers in the journal’s history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="96tlb-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="96tlb-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="96tlb-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In recent years, the story has found new life on social media. A TikTok video featuring the MRI images sparked astonishment, with users questioning how two people fit inside such a narrow machine and noting how loud MRIs are. “How is there room?” one user asked. “Anyone who’s had an MRI knows how intense it is,” another wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="eh8s9-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.SJgGkYiCEbg" id="image_ArticleImageData.SJgGkYiCEbg"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SJgGkYiCEbg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/07/BJmzdci4Zl/BJmzdci4Zl_0_2_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="מכשיר MRI" title="An MRI machine  (Photo: shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SJgGkYiCEbg" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/07/BJmzdci4Zl/BJmzdci4Zl_0_2_1000_563_0_x-large.jpg" alt="מכשיר MRI" title="An MRI machine  (Photo: shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;An MRI machine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="dcrni-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="dcrni-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="dcrni-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Sabelis addressed the reactions herself in a recent interview on the podcast “What Was It Like.” “The magnets are very, very loud, but we managed,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="23nm1-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="23nm1-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="23nm1-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;She also said she never expected the experiment to have such a lasting impact. “This was one of the first MRI machines, so capturing the images took time,” she said. “From the next room, they told us to stay in the same position for maybe a minute. It was quite funny.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="4u2rt-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4u2rt-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4u2rt-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Originally, the plan was to image the couple in the missionary position, but the dimensions of the machine made that impossible. Instead, they squeezed into the narrow tunnel and adopted a spooning position. “It wasn’t romantic,” she said. “It was more an act of love and scientific duty. Luckily, we didn’t suffer from claustrophobia.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="mt9o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="mt9o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="mt9o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Sabelis participated out of ideology as well. An advocate for women’s rights, she wanted to advance medical understanding of the female body, a field she said had been dominated for centuries by male assumptions. “When I saw the images, it was a moment of ‘oh, this is how we really fit together,’” she told Vice in 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="cctth-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cctth-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cctth-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Dr. Arnon Makori, head of imaging at Assuta Medical Centers and a specialist in diagnostic radiology, said the study was far more than a provocative anecdote. It marked a turning point in demonstrating how medical imaging could reveal physiological processes in real time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="5mogq" data-offset-key="9j9ea-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.SygXZKi0E11x" id="image_ArticleImageData.SygXZKi0E11x"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SygXZKi0E11x" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2026/01/07/HkGXf009iNZe/HkGXf009iNZe_0_0_1000_759_0_x-large.jpg" alt="אנטומיה של גוף האדם" title="An old anatomical diagram.

Today, we use it for the heart, fetal movement, bowel loops, joints and brain tissue.

The single-ingredient supplement—among the most thoroughly researched in the nutrition category—is scientifically shown to accelerate muscle growth and strength gains in particular, making it a staple in supplement stacks of weekend warriors and elite athletes alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine acts at the cellular level, where it is stored as phosphocreatine and spurs production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—an energy source used by cells. Most of the creatine that we consume (and produce naturally, albeit slowly) is stored in our muscles. But creatine is stored in other areas of the body as well, such as the brain, where it initiates cellular processes that do much more than build bigger biceps. Years of research show that the knock-on effects of creatine include everything from boosting brain function and warding off cognitive decline to balancing blood sugar and increasing energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While creatine is renowned for enhancing physical strength, its cognitive, mitochondrial, and metabolic benefits are equally compelling,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://drgina.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://drgina.com/"}' href="https://drgina.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gina Nick, NMD, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, naturopathic physician and researcher. “As public interest shifts toward supplements that enhance both performance and longevity, creatine stands out as a cost-effective, research-backed option for improving health at a cellular level. Yet, its benefits for brain function, energy, and metabolic support remain under-discussed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the lesser-known ways creatine can benefit your body, mind, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases energy—for longer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body uses ATP to do much more than just get you yoked. Often referred to as the “energy currency” of the cell, ATP is utilized as a universal energy source throughout the body. As a precursor to ATP, creatine can help keep all systems firing by combating fatigue and supporting energy metabolism. “If we're thinking of ways to give us a jolt, other than our morning caffeine or the numerous energy drinks out there, I would recommend creatine probably right up there with them—maybe even higher, just because the risk profile is a lot lower,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www2.osfhealthcare.org/providers/karan-rai-2297831" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www2.osfhealthcare.org/providers/karan-rai-2297831"}' href="https://www2.osfhealthcare.org/providers/karan-rai-2297831" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Karan Rai, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a sports medicine physician with OSF HealthCare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/570" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/570"}' href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/2/570" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that creatine can help regulate glucose metabolism, which means steadier, more sustained energy levels throughout the day. “[Creatine] can really help kind of even it out, which in turn overall makes you feel more energized, just because you're not crashing all the time,” says. Dr. Rai. It’s also particularly useful for those using weight-loss medications, such as GLP-1s, which can deplete energy stores and muscle mass, says Dr. Nick. “Creatine can help counteract these side effects by preserving lean tissue and supporting cellular energy,” she says. (&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/four-things-you-should-do-after-starting-weight-loss-drugs"&gt;Here are four more things you should do after starting weight-loss drugs.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharpens focus and shores up defenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around five percent of your body’s phosphocreatine stores are in your brain, where cells rely heavily on ATP for energy. When you supplement with creatine, brain cells make good work of the excess fuel, resulting in optimized output. “You're able to build up that store, and that is going to impact cognition, mood, memory, and emotion,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king"}' href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vanessa King, MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietician nutritionist and spokesperson for The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1691485/"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; saw improvements of up to 50 percent in cognitive and memory test scores among people supplementing with creatine. In another &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54249-9#:~:text=Creatine%20alleviated%20SD%2Dinduced%20fatigue,4%20h%20after%20creatine%20administration."&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, creatine helped sleep-deprived subjects improve their performance significantly on short-term memory tasks, along with improved mental processing time and reaction speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to giving your brain a boost, creatine may also help bolster its defenses by playing a neuroprotective role in fending off cognitive decline and more. Clinical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4304302/"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; suggest creatine may help delay the progression of certain neurodegenerative diseases, and several &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/creatine-supplementation-a-potential-therapeutic-approach-for-depression" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/creatine-supplementation-a-potential-therapeutic-approach-for-depression"}' href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/creatine-supplementation-a-potential-therapeutic-approach-for-depression" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found it to be a powerful ally against depression. “I think the cognitive aspect is really under-publicized,” says Dr. Rai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adds endurance when the competition heats up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is widely known as a tool for building muscle and strength, but the supplement can also provide a valuable advantage for cardio and even endurance athletes. “I hope this myth [of creatine just benefitting strength building] will continue to be dispelled,” says Dr. Rai. “From an endurance standpoint, if you think about your slow-twitch versus fast-twitch fibers, they still utilize the creatine pathway for energy production.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 16:01:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBNZE5qZGgwSVNOdEVlQ2xTbDVNUzBwcDBZYTVEVDFDOTZmZXZydTR0Q3ZxX3ltU0hiRFQ5ZG1ZVlhZV3dxVHd2eDVOcHRrd0I0VU8zZ0RWRS00c3M0RDNhRmhncTNIWUJHWGk3MXRn</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员警告King和Snohomish县可能有麻疹暴露- KOMO</title><link>https://komonews.com/news/local/possible-measels-exposure-from-visitors-to-king-snohomish-counties-over-holidays-sea-tac-sea-airport-everett-restaurants-mukilteo-church</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2 class="StoryPage_headline__AP3j8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials warn of possible measles exposure in King and Snohomish counties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="ByLineContainer_storyBylineContainer__0JNT7" id="js-Story-Byline-0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="ByLine_storyByLineText__cze7l"&gt;by KOMO News Staff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="ByLineContainer_storyDatelineText__yS9e8"&gt;Fri, January 9, 2026 at 7:46 AM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="ByLineContainer_storyDatelineText__yS9e8"&gt;&lt;span class="ByLineContainer_updatedText__0D6FY"&gt;Updated &lt;/span&gt;Fri, January 9, 2026 at 8:01 AM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="UserWayButton_userWayButton__h8S9a ByLineContainer_userWayButton___vCFL"&gt;&lt;img alt="UserWay icon for accessibility widget" src="/resources/defaults/news_3.0/icons/accessibility/userway-transparent.svg"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 15:47:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_AFBVV95cUxQTnZWakhjcEJXLVZ2VVVKd1Buc2k4WVRFNDlxUGVUd1VIZUhFbEtUTl9KZUFTY1JwcHVRRGxzZFotd0hJMGN2eWFvbnBOanBLZTFsSTZYOHpZZ2NyZThIYzNkRFBjczVhN0JYZFlLTzV1WlV2bUl3VGlTY292WmFiNThzQ3hscWtjZGpfSUhuTExaNnZSNktmYXhYcWhYUHdvSHoybW90QVpKaG54MjJTQW1UcWlqWm5pSko5N0ZBdjcydVZXeDBNeVQzb0F0UkEtRlJyU2E1eVl0eFBOSjJtUlVvazNSbFNsbkRfQU5ZWlE1YnN3bU5PMTBpWW0</guid></item><item><title>以色列团队开创细菌“工厂” ，在体内生产药物-以色列时报</title><link>https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-team-pioneers-bacteria-factories-to-produce-medicine-inside-the-body/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="the-content"&gt;
					&lt;p&gt;Israeli researchers have developed an innovative method that enables medicine to be manufactured within the body itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pioneering approach, not yet tested on humans, uses live, harmless bacteria that act like tiny factories, producing therapeutic proteins inside the body, exactly where they are needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are accustomed to thinking that to introduce a drug into the body, it must be manufactured in a factory and then delivered via a capsule or an injection,” said Prof. Boaz Mizrahi of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology’s lab for biomaterials in the Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;“This could be a turning point in the world of pharmaceuticals, and a new paradigm for both drug production and consumption,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizrahi recently spoke with The Times of Israel in a joint interview with Dr. Adi Gross, the study’s lead researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Israeli team pioneers bacteria ‘factories’ to produce medicine inside the body"&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;Proteins are used in a variety of medicines, Mizrahi said. One example of a medical protein is insulin, used to help control blood sugar. Another hormone helps people with kidney disease make red blood cells. There are also antibodies and growth hormones made with proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Prof. Boaz Mizrahi of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology’s Faculty of Biotechnology and Food Engineering. (Courtesy/Technion Spokesperson’s Office)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, “proteins are very fragile, and their configuration is critical,” Mizrahi explained. If they are swallowed, for example, the stomach and intestines treat them like food and break them down, so they are ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ novel method enables bacteria to produce and release perfectly configured, ready-for-use proteins within the body.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;After testing on mice, the approach was written up in a peer-reviewed study which appeared in the journal &lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adhm.202503630"&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials.&lt;/a&gt; The research was co-directed by doctoral student Caroline Hali Alperovitz and supported by the Israel Science Foundation and the Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute at the Technion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique “opens the door to a new kind of treatment,” Mizrahi said, including therapeutics for severe burns, war wounds, diabetes wounds, and inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of bacteria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mizrahi said his lab is “inspired by nature, using knowledge collected by nature for centuries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that for the past several years, scientists worldwide have been exploring the use of engineered bacterial therapies. The bacteria, which are genetically modified, can then deliver medicines and therapeutics to treat cancer, metabolic disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their earlier research, the scientists were able to use what Mizrahi called this “living materials” approach with a microneedle patch system that produced useful polymers, or large molecules, inside the skin. The method formed the basis for the current research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We needed something that can both synthesize and secrete in situ, within a specific place in the body, giving it the best condition, to produce and release therapeutic agents,” Mizrahi said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their study, the Israeli scientists used a harmless bacterium, Bacillus paralicheniformis, and engineered it to produce the protein γ-PGA (gamma-PGA). This protein plays a vital role in the healing of severe wounds and in reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then used a microneedle patch, which the scientists designed and manufactured, to deliver the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the simplest patch that you can think of,” Mizrahi said. “It’s like a Band-Aid.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the patch is applied to the skin, the microneedles penetrate the inner layer of the skin and then dissolve. They do not harm nerves or blood vessels. Inside the body, the bacteria act as a “factory,” exactly where they are needed, according to Gross.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_3721692" class="wp-caption  alignright"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/234234-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-3721692 size-vertical" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2025/12/234234-2-300x480.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
		&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustrative: a bacterium (in light blue) serving as a miniature drug factory that produces the active compound in the target area, the skin. (Courtesy/Technion-Israel Institute of Technology)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “allows the bacteria to start producing and releasing the therapeutic protein right at the treatment site,” Gross said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers used detailed chemical analysis to confirm that the bacteria produced a “pure and active therapeutic substance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating mice in the lab, the scientists found that their skin remained healthy. The patch dissolved within just two hours, with no signs of inflammation or tissue trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, Mizrahi envisioned patients being able to use the patch “like a sticker.”&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“It causes zero pain, and unlike an injection, it doesn’t require medical staff,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‘Huge benefit’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new technology offers several advantages to traditional medicines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The diseased organ will always get freshly-produced proteins because they’re produced inside the body,” Mizrahi said. “That’s a huge benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since some proteins are unable to be absorbed into the body, and others are sensitive to exposure to air, this approach circumvents those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the bacteria multiply within the tissue, the researchers said, a single dose of bacteria introduced into the target organ can be sufficient for days, thereby reducing treatment costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, insulin is a protein hormone that a healthy body makes in the pancreas. Diabetes patients, who are unable to produce their own insulin, are given insulin, mostly by injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the future, we could treat patients using this ‘living’ system,” Mizrahi said. Currently, the researchers are experimenting with different bacteria to release other proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked if they were surprised by the success of their experiment, Mizrahi said, “We never know if it’s going to work. That’s part of the excitement.”&lt;/p&gt;

While medication can help, simple lifestyle changes can also go far toward lowering blood pressure.

Below, discover what the study found, how a cardiologist and registered dietitian interpret the findings, and whether you should start sipping beet juice as part of your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65935582/top-foods-for-heart-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-padma-shenoy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Padma Shenoy, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Padma Shenoy, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and LabFinder.com contributor and &lt;a href="https://www.citytoseanutrition.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of City to Sea Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the small randomized double-blind crossover study, which was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891584925008068" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Free Radical Biology and Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Free Radical Biology and Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;researchers linked beetroot juice consumption with lowered blood pressure in older adults. Over three two-week trial periods (with two week breaks in between each one), study participants were instructed to either drink nitrate-rich beet juice or a placebo beet juice twice daily or rinse their mouths with mouthwash twice daily for 30 seconds, aside from the last day, which prompted one final drink or rinse. The beet juice and placebo drinkers did not use mouthwash during their assigned juice-drinking periods. Participants were divided into two demographics—younger adults (aged between 18 and 30) and older adults (aged between 67 to 79). There were 42 young adults and 36 older adults, making for a small, combined cohort of 78 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to analyze how bacterial changes within the oral microbiome may influence blood pressure levels. So, researchers monitored both the whole time. Participants were not medicated for any pulmonary, cardiovascular, or metabolic conditions, nor did they have ulcerative colitis, renal disease, or active oral disease or dentures. People who smoked and people with stage 2 hypertension or those who had used antibiotics within three months prior to the study were also excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The testing began after an overnight fast and the avoidance of strenuous exercise, alcohol, and caffeine for 24 hours. Other than drinking their assigned drink (70 milliliters of beet juice or placebo morning and evening, or that 30-second twice-daily rinse), participants proceeded normally with all their other habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the three trials were compared, researchers concluded that drinking beetroot juice may help lower blood pressure in older adults (the blood pressure-lowering effect was not seen in the younger group). According to &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-padma-shenoy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Padma Shenoy, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Padma Shenoy, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and LabFinder.com contributor, this was “likely by changing the composition of bacteria in the mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, researchers discovered that drinking beet juice led to “a decrease in certain bacteria (like Prevotella) and an increase in others (such as Neisseria and Rothia) that are better at converting dietary nitrate into nitric oxide, a compound that helps blood vessels relax,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.citytoseanutrition.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of City to Sea Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does beet juice lower blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened in the study seems to be based on the relationship between nitrates, blood pressure, and the oral microbiome. &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90/BEHRP_Food+Safety_Nitrates+and+Food+Safety_ENG_03272024.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;amp;CONVERT_TO=url&amp;amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_K9I401S01H7F40QBNJU3SO1F56-a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90-pqHU0Xc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nitrates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nitrates&lt;/a&gt; are chemicals found naturally in the environment, vegetables, and preserved meats. With the help of the aforementioned bacteria that live in the mouth, dietary nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which can improve heart health by relaxing blood vessels and boosting blood flow, said Dr. Shenoy. In fact, nitrates are commonly found in blood pressure-controlling medications, she added. “That’s why diets high in nitrate-rich vegetables, like spinach, arugula, and beets, are consistently linked with better vascular health,” concluded Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question mark hanging over these findings is the role of the oral microbiome, but it does appear to have one. “We are still learning about the connection between the oral microbiome and blood pressure, but it is possible that certain bacteria in the mouth could turn nutrients into substances that lower blood pressure,” Dr. Shenoy explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may have previously heard of concerns regarding &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/chemical_exposures/nitrate" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:excess nitrate consumption;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;excess nitrate consumption&lt;/a&gt; and the potential cancer risk associated with it. Those concerns are largely linked to processed food (like deli meats and cheeses) and water sources with added nitrates that aim to prevent bacteria growth and improve food’s taste and color. Naturally occurring nitrates in vegetables are considered safe to eat (and are found in some of the healthiest foods, like leafy greens, beets, and celery). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you try it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“According to this study, only older adults experienced a slight drop in blood pressure from drinking beetroot juice, and more studies are needed to explore which individuals will respond,” said Dr. Shenoy. “Eating more vegetables like beetroot may help heart health, but it is important to remember that is just one part of a healthy lifestyle. More research is needed to support strong recommendations to consume beetroot as a blood-pressure lowering therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it does not appear that drinking beet juice will hinder your efforts to lower your blood pressure, Dr. Shenoy stressed that it's only one tool in your toolbox. "Other components of a heart-healthy lifestyle include eating a varied diet, limiting sodium intake, and exercising regularly," she said. The combination of these healthy choices—plus personalized recommendations from your physician—will have the largest effect on your blood pressure and heart health overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 14:14:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPSVZsYkNvZURWYXJiMTdoakhISHVtZ0lnaFllQnNkOEN4Wlp6QVlGbUpTTDJlQzNoOWtkVDE3SXllNnFkbmhNU3BTSUVHNGE4MVZfdi16d29HQWRPeTc1dGsxQlREdkNodGNuMnJTWHBuUWZOOVFZcnI5RWg2aU9XREkwLVNUWVZ0M3c</guid></item><item><title>我把声音看作形状。通感赋予了我非凡的语言能力--《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/10/auditory-visual-synaesthesia-languages</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;ar journeys with my partner are a nightmare. He’s an ex-DJ so he likes to crank the music up, but for me this means seeing static images and flashes of light in my mind’s eye while I’m trying to drive. It’s hard to describe exactly what I see when I hear sound. But it’s almost like the sound waves you’d see if you watched an audio recording on a screen, or these little neurons connecting and space nebulas exploding in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’m 44 now and only realised I had auditory-visual synaesthesia in my 30s. What I did know was that I seemed to have an extraordinary ability for linguistics. In school I studied Japanese and did really well without trying because I could literally see the words and sounds presented as images in front of me, making them easy to remember. At university I majored in Spanish, Korean and Indonesian and it was no effort at all. I then joined the air force as an intelligence officer because I didn’t want to become a teacher or translator. I walked away from the language aptitude test thinking I’d either messed it up or that it had been the easiest thing I’d ever done in my life. No one’s ever managed to get every answer right, they said when the results came back. But I hadn’t even tried. It just came naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7bdf26c2-a1fe-4d86-8150-a5147c09bbf1" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":2,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I taste words. ‘Bob’ is like a milk chocolate Easter egg on my tongue","elementId":"7bdf26c2-a1fe-4d86-8150-a5147c09bbf1","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2026/jan/02/i-taste-words-lexical-gustatory-synaesthesia"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The first time I heard the word synaesthesia was when I decided to work in speech pathology after leaving the military. I started learning about autism spectrum disorder and various forms of neurodivergence, and read about this phenomenon called synaesthesia, in which stimulation of one sense leads to automatic experiences in a second sense. I didn’t make any connection to my own experiences but began reading a book about a man who could learn languages in a matter of hours. Still, I didn’t make the connection. I just thought it was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It wasn’t until I started doing speech-to-text computational linguistic work that I started really thinking about the fact that I was seeing these shapes when I heard sounds or phonemes. I found a Facebook group full of people who saw sounds too, though they all saw sounds as colours whereas mine are all black and white shapes. The only time I see colour is when I hear high-frequency sounds, which start as bright white then move through the scale of yellows to oranges to reds. I’ve always been able to pass hearing tests at ridiculously quiet decibels because I see the pure tones as different coloured flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="861f071e-c525-4f23-aedc-b41d0f45b783" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘My brain feels busy pretty much constantly thanks to the noisy world we live in.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Blake Sharp-Wiggins/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One day I was working as an assistant transcribing Indigenous creole languages for Wollongong University when my supervisor put me in touch with the head linguist for Apple. She was looking for someone really good with phonetics, who would be free to go to Japan for 90 days to work on a new speech-to-text project. On day one of the job I found out I’d been chosen to work on Siri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I spent a lot of time in headphones over those next 90 days, as they recorded Australian voices and I sat in. I loved it and I’ve loved pretty much every work-day since. I’ve done speech-to-text projects for Tom Tom GPS and Bank of America, and a lot of my day-to-day work now is as a speech pathologist, helping children and adults to communicate and swallow better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’m not worried about the rise of AI because language is incredibly nuanced and robots simply aren’t good enough to pick up those subtleties. I can break down the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/25/its-an-expression-of-identity-the-tiktoker-taking-the-western-sydney-accent-to-the-world" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;western Sydney Lebanese accent&lt;/a&gt; in an instant. I wouldn’t trust AI to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My form of synaesthesia comes with its challenges. I wear a lot of earplugs to block out the sound around me, and my brain feels busy pretty much constantly thanks to the noisy world we live in. Running to music is my favourite way to switch off. It’s the only time I don’t see sound and my brain is quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of that said, I wouldn’t change my synaesthesia for a second. I could lose my sight and cut my arms off, but if I couldn’t work with words and sounds it would destroy me. I feel so lucky that I found this field of work when I did, and I’ll keep going until I’m 80 if I can. It feels like my reason for being – my &lt;em&gt;ikigai&lt;/em&gt;, they call it in Japanese. I’d do it for free if I didn’t have bills to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 14:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPUFBJNmk4SUh3NkJIeEs2aVVnbWNkNWRDZ2FhMU9TU0VYYkVTSTVFQ3Ixb1pBQVpSZ24yVzI5dmdnSW1xYWlhSTl2UThYcTFyd0RGRlJVYnFycEdQbUc3TGo3THlFRDgtd2I0ekNDZGNsQ280NEE2SXp4UjIwS3Z0RzJYZWQ1WE9aenRod2VhRTFlZE5hdGc</guid></item><item><title>大多数与单个基因变异相关的阿尔茨海默氏症病例- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-alzheimer-cases-linked-variants-gene.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

That compares with 146 at the same time last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The 2024-25 season ended with nearly 1,750 hospitalizations in the three counties and &lt;a href="https://www.thelundreport.org/content/two-children-died-flu-oregon-over-christmas-week" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;two deaths&lt;/a&gt; among children, the only flu deaths the state tracks. Those were the first such deaths in two years. Hospitalizations from the flu continued into the spring last year as well, with 10 people in the metro area hospitalized the week of April 27 to May 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Officials from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="(opens in a new window)"&gt;warned last week&lt;/a&gt; that this flu season was shaping up to be ‚Äúmoderately severe,‚Äù with a new strain of the influenza A virus ‚Äî an H3N2 variant ‚Äî sweeping across the country. Nationwide, 11 million people have been sick, with 120,000 hospitalized. A total of 5,000 people have been killed, including nine children, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Some are calling it the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/flu-highest-level-25-years" target="_blank" rel="" title="(opens in a new window)"&gt;worst flu season&lt;/a&gt; in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;In the Portland area, 124 people have been hospitalized with the flu since the season started at the beginning of November, giving the state a rate of 6.8 hospitalizations per 100,000 people. That compares with 11.9 people out of 100,000 hospitalized at the peak last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúHospitalization rates are beginning to increase but remain relatively low overall,‚Äù Tim Heider, an Oregon Health Authority spokesperson, told The Lund Report in an email. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Federal officials expect hospitalizations in Oregon to continue to increase in the coming weeks, Heider said. So far, they don‚Äôt appear likely to match the numbers of last year, but he said state officials aren‚Äôt able to make any predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúAt this time, we are not seeing any indicators of unusual severity,‚Äù Heider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The state does not track flu hospitalizations statewide. The Portland area accounts for more than 40% of Oregon‚Äôs population, reflecting the situation across the state, Heider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúWe believe that these hospitalization rates generalize to the greater state as once influenza activity increases in one region, it quickly spreads statewide,‚Äù Heider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Influenza A is causing almost all of the infections in the U.S. and in Oregon. State officials have not analyzed whether infections in Oregon are being caused by the new variant, but state officials assume it is here, Heider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;State officials do not track individual cases of the flu but instead monitor the rate of people reported with positive tests for the virus. That rate hit nearly 16% last week, up from nearly 11% the week before. In comparison, about a third of the tests were positive at the same time last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body--padding f_primary f_bold color_dgray"&gt;Officials urge Oregonians to get vaccinated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The health authority‚Äôs infectious disease director, Dr. Howard Chiou, said last month the season would likely continue into the spring. He urged residents to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The shot this year does not fully match the new strain, but health officials said it is still the best way to prevent severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúThe vaccine typically reduces the risk of hospitalization by about 50%,‚Äù Heider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The vaccination rate in Oregon has fallen in recent years, however, with an overall drop of about 4% last year. And that trend is continuing this year, health authority data shows. So far, more than 1.1 million residents have gotten a flu shot, more than 30,000 or nearly 3% fewer than this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The vaccination is recommended for those at least 6 months old. Young children and the elderly face the highest risk of severe illness, with older adults accounting for many of the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Besides vaccination, health officials recommend that residents take the usual precautions against respiratory diseases by staying away from others and masking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Those who get sick should stay home, cover their cough and wash their hands. Health officials say people should take special care to avoid infecting elderly people with chronic health conditions because they‚Äôre the most susceptible to getting severely ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;At the first sign of symptoms, they should see a health care provider. There are several treatments to lessen the severity of illness, including Tamiflu or Oseltamivir, which blocks the virus from spreading in the body.

ROACH: I am a generally healthy 70-year-old man, and I like to drink orange juice -- the kind that is freshly squeezed with no additives but is pasteurized. I also like to eat strawberries almost every day. My recent A1C and glucose levels were 6% and 110 mg/dL, respectively. My prior year readings were 5.5% and 100 mg/dL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LJJGUCRYWZGMDPAKHBRZSAVY5A"&gt;I’ve read that ingesting natural sugars is OK because they slow down the absorption and digestion rates, but I wonder what your thoughts are on this. Should I be cutting out strawberries and orange juice altogether? -- M.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4SR3Z3NSBZAS5H6F6WZJG5G3QE"&gt;ANSWER: It is true that eating whole fruit slows the absorption of sugar, so oranges would be much better for your blood sugar than orange juice, no matter how fresh it is or whether it has additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CLMD6UWR4VGXDMOSNJNWTIHPFQ"&gt;Orange juice contains three different sugars: sucrose, glucose and fructose. It is roughly half sucrose and 25% of glucose and fructose each. Your body can’t tell a molecule of fructose or sucrose from orange juice apart from those that come from high fructose corn syrup in a can of soda. (For example, Coca-Cola in the United States is a mixture of 55% sucrose and 45% glucose.) These sugars get absorbed quickly -- about twice as quickly as the sugar in whole oranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QPYLZSBHBZGZ7IBDIJ7GXC3DPA"&gt;Strawberries are an even better choice than whole oranges. The polyphenols and fiber in strawberries slow sugar absorption, giving your body more time to raise insulin levels to keep your blood sugar under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4W3NHCVJVJG7JO7XZZMW5A7WPA"&gt;Having other food at the same time can also help. Fats and proteins slow down sugar and other carbohydrate absorption, so I often see people adding some nuts, like almonds or walnuts, to their fruit snack or meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OO5BUUGYQBEZVF7PRYH6FDQMNQ"&gt;I also enjoy a glass of fresh orange juice, but I make it small and occasional, which is good advice for people who are trying to manage their blood sugars, especially when you are trying to prevent prediabetes (an A1C above 5.7% and below 6.5%) from becoming diabetes (6.5% or higher).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. I am a 67-year-old female, and before this, I was at the osteopenia level for several years. The treatment that is being recommended to me is an IV treatment called Reclast. I have never heard of this before and would like your take on it. -- K.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UIDRSGD2LJBIHCNGAOHU33AT6Q"&gt;ANSWER: Osteopenia and osteoporosis are both conditions where bones lose minerals and strength. This can be an age-related process in both women and men or may be as a result of an underlying condition. Some medications (especially steroids like prednisone), hormonal abnormalities, nutritional disorders, and bone marrow disease can be underlying causes of osteoporosis and should be considered prior to therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T342XE4WUVH6XO7HYV5LNHLZCA"&gt;For most women with age-related osteoporosis, the decision to begin therapy starts with the fracture risk, which can be estimated via the FRAX score once the bone density is known. For those who decide on therapy, medications to slow the excess bone reabsorption that is the hallmark of age-related osteoporosis is usually the first-line treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XSEWCSTBHBGU3G7NQHQYQHGSPA"&gt;You have probably heard of alendronate (Fosamax) or ibandrobate (Boniva), and zoledronic acid (Reclast) is in the same class called bisphosphonates. It has a major advantage for some people when dosed intravenously (which avoids the possibility of damage to the stomach or esophagus) every year, or sometimes every two years. Bone density is monitored carefully, and most people are on these drugs for three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7H75ETHVNRB27HF2ROGC4WHXHQ"&gt;Many readers have heard of bad side effects from bisphosphonate drugs, but when used correctly, they reduce the risk of hip and spine fractures, which are life-changing events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DHPDVA2RL5CMJBOWETJ44BQNPQ"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

The disease worsens over time and primarily damages central vision, making it difficult to see faces, read text or focus on objects directly ahead. As the condition progresses, people may experience blurry areas, dark patches or blind spots in the center of their vision.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now launching a new clinical trial that could offer hope to people with advanced dry age-related macular degeneration. This form of the disease is the most widespread and currently has very limited treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the USC Roski Eye Institute, part of Keck Medicine of USC, are beginning a phase 2b clinical trial to test whether stem cells can be used to replace damaged retinal cells and potentially restore vision. The stem cells are attached to an ultra-thin implant, thinner than a strand of hair, designed to hold the cells in place once inserted into the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are hoping to determine if the stem-cell based retinal implant can not only stop the progression of dry age-related macular degeneration, but actually improve patients' vision," said Sun Young Lee, MD, PhD, a retinal surgeon with Keck Medicine and principal investigator of the Keck Medicine study site. "The findings could be groundbreaking because while there are a few treatments available that delay the progress of macular degeneration, there are none able to reverse the damage already done."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encouraging Results From Earlier Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new trial builds on earlier research conducted by USC Roski Eye Institute specialists involving a small group of patients. That initial study found the implant was safe, remained securely positioned in the eye and was successfully absorbed into the retinal tissue. Notably, 27% of participants experienced some level of vision improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The earlier phase of the clinical trial showed the treatment to be safe with the potential to benefit patients' vision; this next phase will investigate whether the therapy can achieve clinically significant improvements in vision," said Lee, who is also an associate professor of ophthalmology and physiology &amp;amp; neuroscience at the Keck School of Medicine of USC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Retinal Implant Is Designed to Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly 20 million Americans are living with age-related macular degeneration. This figure includes people with wet macular degeneration, which is less common but typically more severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease affects the macula, a small area at the center of the retina that is essential for sharp, detailed vision. In advanced stages, cells known as retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells become damaged or stop functioning. These cells play a critical role in maintaining healthy vision, and their loss leads directly to visual decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implant being tested in the trial is created from embryonic stem cells that are grown in a laboratory and developed into RPE cells. During an outpatient surgical procedure, Keck Medicine eye surgeons will place a thin layer of these lab-grown cells directly into the retina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The study will explore if the lab-engineered implant will take over for the damaged cells, function as normal RPE cells would, and improve vision for patients who may currently have no other options for improvement," said Rodrigo Antonio Brant Fernandes, MD, PhD, an ophthalmologist with Keck Medicine and the study surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Trial Locations and Patient Eligibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keck Medicine is one of five sites nationwide participating in the clinical trial. The study is masked, meaning some participants will receive the actual implant while others will undergo a simulated procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To qualify, patients must be between the ages of 55-90 and have advanced dry age-related macular degeneration along with geographic atrophy, a condition in which RPE cells are damaged or no longer function properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants will be followed for at least one year so researchers can evaluate how well the implant is tolerated and track any changes in vision. The study aims to enroll 24 patients in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those interested in learning more about the trial can contact Mariana Edwards at &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#274a46554e4649460942435046554354674a42430952544409424352"&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="335e52415a525d521d56574452415740735e56571d4640501d565746"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or Kimberly Rodriguez at &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ee8587838c8b9c8297c09c818a9c87899b8b94dcae838b8ac09b9d8dc08b8a9b"&gt;&lt;span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2d4644404f485f4154035f42495f444a5848571f6d40484903585e4e03484958"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Vision for Stem Cell Eye Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The USC Roski Eye Institute is dedicated to furthering innovative treatments to help improve lives by restoring vision," said Mark S. Humayun, MD, PhD, co-director of the USC Roski Eye Institute, director of the USC Ginsberg Institute for Biomedical Therapeutics and the Dennis and Michele Slivinski Chair in Macular Degeneration Research at the Keck School. "Stem cell-derived retinal implants may offer one of the greatest possibilities for helping patients with dry age-related macular degeneration and one day, may offer a cure."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bioengineered RPE retinal implant is produced by Regenerative Patch Technologies LLC, a clinical-stage company focused on developing stem cell-based implants for retinal diseases. Humayun co-invented the implant and is also a co-founder of the company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Over three two-week trial periods (with two week breaks in between each one), study participants were instructed to either drink nitrate-rich beet juice or a placebo beet juice twice daily or rinse their mouths with mouthwash twice daily for 30 seconds, aside from the last day, which prompted one final drink or rinse. The beet juice and placebo drinkers did not use mouthwash during their assigned juice-drinking periods. Participants were divided into two demographics—younger adults (aged between 18 and 30) and older adults (aged between 67 to 79). There were 42 young adults and 36 older adults, making for a small, combined cohort of 78 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The goal was to analyze how bacterial changes within the oral microbiome may influence blood pressure levels. So, researchers monitored both the whole time. Participants were not medicated for any pulmonary, cardiovascular, or metabolic conditions, nor did they have ulcerative colitis, renal disease, or active oral disease or dentures. People who smoked and people with stage 2 hypertension or those who had used antibiotics within three months prior to the study were also excluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The testing began after an overnight fast and the avoidance of strenuous exercise, alcohol, and caffeine for 24 hours. Other than drinking their assigned drink (70 milliliters of beet juice or placebo morning and evening, or that 30-second twice-daily rinse), participants proceeded normally with all their other habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;After the three trials were compared, researchers concluded that drinking beetroot juice may help lower blood pressure in older adults (the blood pressure-lowering effect was not seen in the younger group). According to &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-padma-shenoy/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-padma-shenoy/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Padma Shenoy, M.D" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Padma Shenoy, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a cardiologist with Manhattan Cardiology and LabFinder.com contributor, this was “likely by changing the composition of bacteria in the mouth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;More specifically, researchers discovered that drinking beet juice led to “a decrease in certain bacteria (like Prevotella) and an increase in others (such as Neisseria and Rothia) that are better at converting dietary nitrate into nitric oxide, a compound that helps blood vessels relax,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.citytoseanutrition.com/about" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.citytoseanutrition.com/about" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N." data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Elizabeth Adrian, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and founder of City to Sea Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-beet-juice-lower-blood-pressure" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;How does beet juice lower blood pressure? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;What happened in the study seems to be based on the relationship between nitrates, blood pressure, and the oral microbiome. &lt;a href="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90/BEHRP_Food+Safety_Nitrates+and+Food+Safety_ENG_03272024.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;amp;CONVERT_TO=url&amp;amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_K9I401S01H7F40QBNJU3SO1F56-a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90-pqHU0Xc" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90/BEHRP_Food+Safety_Nitrates+and+Food+Safety_ENG_03272024.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;amp;CONVERT_TO=url&amp;amp;CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_K9I401S01H7F40QBNJU3SO1F56-a05928a0-9fa4-496b-8fbb-30ee886b0e90-pqHU0Xc" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nitrates" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Nitrates&lt;/a&gt; are chemicals found naturally in the environment, vegetables, and preserved meats. With the help of the aforementioned bacteria that live in the mouth, dietary nitrates are converted to nitric oxide, which can improve heart health by relaxing blood vessels and boosting blood flow, said Dr. Shenoy. In fact, nitrates are commonly found in blood pressure-controlling medications, she added. “That’s why diets high in nitrate-rich vegetables, like spinach, arugula, and beets, are consistently linked with better vascular health,” concluded Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The question mark hanging over these findings is the role of the oral microbiome, but it does appear to have one. “We are still learning about the connection between the oral microbiome and blood pressure, but it is possible that certain bacteria in the mouth could turn nutrients into substances that lower blood pressure,” Dr. Shenoy explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;You may have previously heard of concerns regarding &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/chemical_exposures/nitrate" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/chemical_exposures/nitrate" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="excess nitrate consumption" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;excess nitrate consumption&lt;/a&gt; and the potential cancer risk associated with it. Those concerns are largely linked to processed food (like deli meats and cheeses) and water sources with added nitrates that aim to prevent bacteria growth and improve food’s taste and color. Naturally occurring nitrates in vegetables are considered safe to eat (and are found in some of the healthiest foods, like leafy greens, beets, and celery). &lt;br data-node-id="13.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="should-you-try-it" data-node-id="14" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;Should you try it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“According to this study, only older adults experienced a slight drop in blood pressure from drinking beetroot juice, and more studies are needed to explore which individuals will respond,” said Dr. Shenoy. “Eating more vegetables like beetroot may help heart health, but it is important to remember that is just one part of a healthy lifestyle. More research is needed to support strong recommendations to consume beetroot as a blood-pressure lowering therapy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While it does not appear that drinking beet juice will hinder your efforts to lower your blood pressure, Dr. Shenoy stressed that it's only one tool in your toolbox. "Other components of a heart-healthy lifestyle include eating a varied diet, limiting sodium intake, and exercising regularly," she said. The combination of these healthy choices—plus personalized recommendations from your physician—will have the largest effect on your blood pressure and heart health overall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 13:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNakZlNVBnalZXN2ZvV3BSRTdsVUZsQVJoYWtfaVFBX1llRXViZjEwQ0M4ZlpiT2xkSURaeXdxSV90WTdRVGRDcXJhTWdNSk9XbndXWkFYX3VXeWNCZjFUak02UlNNd0lmVWQ4T1gyMUN4aGlzYjZXbjBMRUl6RlBkQUNjdnVTNm9NTHJj</guid></item><item><title>科学家找到了增强免疫系统抗癌能力的方法- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260108231333.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Scientists at the University of Southampton have developed a new strategy designed to strengthen how the immune system responds to cancer. The approach aims to help immune cells recognize and attack tumors more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. In the study, researchers tested specially engineered antibodies designed to more strongly activate T cells, the immune cells responsible for killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Antibodies Can Boost Immune Signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These antibodies work by grabbing and clustering several immune cell receptors at once, which increases the strength of the signal that tells a T cell to attack cancer. When these signals are stronger, T cells are more likely to launch a full immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team from the University of Southampton's Centre for Cancer Immunology focused on a receptor called CD27. This receptor needs a matching key (ligand) to activate T cells. During infections, the body naturally produces this ligand, but cancer cells do not. Without it, T cells receive only a weak activation signal and struggle to attack tumors effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Traditional Antibodies Fall Short&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies can sometimes act like a master key, helping trigger immune responses. However, most antibodies used in medicine today have a Y shaped structure with two arms, which limits them to binding just two receptors at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although antibody based treatments have transformed cancer care, they do not work for every patient. In some cancers, T cells still fail to become fully active because they are missing the combination of signals needed to mount a strong attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Four Pronged Antibody Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The antibodies developed in this study were built with four binding arms instead of two. This allows them to attach to more receptors simultaneously. They also recruit a second immune cell, which forces all the CD27 receptors being held to gather together. This clustering greatly amplifies the activation signal and closely mimics how CD27 is triggered naturally in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Aymen Al Shamkhani at the University of Southampton, who led the research, said: "We already understood how the body's natural CD27 signal switches on T cells, but turning that knowledge into a medicine was the real challenge. Antibodies are reliable molecules that make excellent drugs. However, the natural antibody format was not powerful enough, so we had to create a more effective version."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger Activation of Cancer Fighting T Cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory tests using mice and human immune cells showed that the new antibodies were much better at activating CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells than standard Y shaped antibodies. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells are often described as the special forces of the immune system because of their ability to directly destroy cancer cells. The enhanced activation led to a stronger anti tumor response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making CD27 easier to target with therapy, the research offers a roadmap for developing new immunotherapy treatments that better harness the immune system's natural power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Al Shamkhani added: "This approach could help improve future cancer treatments by allowing the immune system to work closer to its full potential."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by Cancer Research UK and highlights the Centre for Cancer Immunology's role in advancing innovative approaches to cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Children under six are vaccinated at Tipat Halav clinics, while children aged 7 and older and adults receive vaccinations through their health funds. Unvaccinated individuals or those with only one dose should complete the series if at least four weeks have passed since the last dose.

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;By simply standing, you’re revving up the demand on your abs.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Standing exercises are extremely popular—especially among older adults. In fact, they’re highly recommended for building strength and balance, activating many muscle groups at once, and channeling daily movements, like climbing steps and walking. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/standing-exercises-shrink-lower-belly-fat-after-55/" target="_blank"&gt;Standing exercise&lt;/a&gt; can boost your coordination—plus, this form of training is easy on the joints. And that’s not all! With consistency, they can help you &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/daily-exercises-burn-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;shrink pesky belly fat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with &lt;b&gt;Steve Chambers&lt;/b&gt;, Senior Certified Personal Trainer and Gym Manager at&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://ultimateperformance.com" target="_blank"&gt; Ultimate Performance&lt;/a&gt;, who shares five standing exercises that will shrink belly pooch faster than gym machines after 55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your core exists to stabilize your body while you are upright. Walking, lifting, bending, carrying shopping, getting up from a chair etc.—all of these require your abdominal muscles to work while you’re standing,” Chambers tells us. “The simple act of standing already demands core activation. Once you start adding load, movement, and instability, the demand on your abs increases dramatically. This is why standing core exercises are so powerful. They force your abdominal muscles to brace, stabilise, rotate, resist movement, and support your spine in real-world positions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike exercises you perform when lying down, you can also work progressive overload into standing workouts easier by revving up the time under tension or weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That progressive overload is essential if you want your muscles, especially your abs, to actually change,” Chambers explains. “After 55, this approach becomes even more important. You’re not just training for appearance as you might have done in your 20s and early 30s. Instead, you’re training for strength, balance, posture, metabolic health, and longevity. &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/8-minute-standing-core-strength-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;Standing core exercises&lt;/a&gt; deliver all of that in one package.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Chambers, it’s important to note that spot reduction is a myth and fat loss occurs throughout the body.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Doing hundreds of crunches will not reduce the fat across your midsection unless your diet supports fat loss, which means eating in a calorific deficit,” Chambers says. “However, standing core exercises are exceptionally effective because they help you build muscle, raise energy expenditure, and strengthen the muscles that give your waistline shape and firmness as fat comes off.”&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="farmers-walk" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Farmer’s Walk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OtwXwrJizk?si=QiFq2oxT9VW-AdAn" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s walk is one of the most underrated core moves. By carrying a set of heavy weights while walking, you’re forcing your core to stay braced and your torso to remain stable and tall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Farmer’s walks heavily recruit the abdominals, obliques, lower back, shoulders, and grip, all the while driving up your heart rate. That combination of muscular tension and cardiovascular demand makes them incredibly effective for fat loss,” Chambers explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold a heavy dumbbell or kettlebell—50% of your body weight—in each hand at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start walking forward, keeping your torso still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="deadlifts" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deadlifts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2p-qoY6rCc?si=z8kl9fzGQh1LueoV" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deadlifts may not seem like a classic ab workout, but Chambers says they’re one of the best core builders out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every repetition requires your abdominals and obliques to brace hard to protect your spine while your lower body generates force, and will improve your posture (which is a big concern as you get older,” Chambers tells us. “For people over 55, deadlifts are especially valuable because they help preserve muscle mass, strengthen the posterior chain, and raise metabolic demand, all of which are incredibly important since people over 55 face health problems such as sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass) and osteoporosis (bone weakening), both of which can negatively affect your posture. A stronger, more muscular body burns more calories at rest, which directly supports belly fat reduction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-width apart, holding a heavy dumbbell in each hand in front of your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your legs are mostly straight with just a slight bend in the knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hinge at the hips to lower the dumbbells down your legs and toward the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your back flat and the dumbbells close to your body when lowering, feeling a solid stretch in the hamstrings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your glutes and hamstrings as you rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="squats" class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squats are another essential exercise that should be prioritized. They fire up almost the entire muscular system, including your abs, which are constantly working to keep you balanced and upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most effective ways to maximize the core benefit of squats is to focus on bracing. In other words, taking a deep breath, tightening your midsection, and maintaining tension throughout the movement,” Chambers says. “This turns the squat into a powerful core-strengthening tool as well as a calorie-burning exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms in front of you or place your hands on your hips. Use a chair for support, if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the knees and hips as you lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to descend until your thighs assume a “sitting” position or lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 id="dumbbell-side-bends" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dumbbell Side Bends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RfuiraEgKcY?si=JMtMVaPJKY5T9Q-Z" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Side bends are an excellent way to directly target the obliques and the deep muscles that support the spine. Unlike many floor-based oblique exercises, side bends allow you to use meaningful load, making progressive overload possible,” Chambers points out. “This is particularly important after 55, when maintaining muscle mass around the waist helps improve posture, spinal support, and the appearance of the midsection as body fat decreases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-width apart, holding a light dumbbell in each hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activate your core and slowly bend your torso to the right, lowering the right dumbbell toward your thigh while keeping your left arm by your side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly bend your torso to the left, lowering your left dumbbell toward your thigh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="standing-woodchops" class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Standing Woodchops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;Wood chops are another highly effective rotational movement. Performed with a cable, dumbbell, resistance band, or even bodyweight, they train the abs, obliques, shoulders, and upper back simultaneously,” Chambers says. “Because the movement pattern involves twisting under tension, wood chops challenge your core in ways that sit-ups and planks simply cannot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell with both hands and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift the dumbbell toward your right side, keeping your arms straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist your torso, and carefully rotate your legs to bring the dumbbell down to your left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the knees while dropping your hips to bring the dumbbell toward the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat by lifting the dumbbell back to the right and overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks and strokes rarely occur without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to health data from more than 9 million adults in South Korea and the US, nearly everyone who develops heart disease and suffers a major cardiovascular event has one of four major risk factors in the lead-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar levels, and tobacco smoking (past or current).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nearly-half-of-all-heart-attacks-may-be-missed-by-current-screening-tools"&gt;Nearly Half of All Heart Attacks May Be Missed by Current Screening Tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined as a group, they preceded 99 percent of all cardiovascular events during the long-term study, which was published in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176016" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/mm6805a2_Heart-Attack-Awareness-VA1200x675-medium.jpg" alt="CDC Heart Attack" class="size-full wp-image-176016" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/mm6805a2_Heart-Attack-Awareness-VA1200x675-medium.jpg 635w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/mm6805a2_Heart-Attack-Awareness-VA1200x675-medium-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176016" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Recognizing the imminent signs of a heart attack could save lives.

In both the US and South Korea, more than 93 percent of individuals who experienced a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure had hypertension beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing this risk factor could, therefore, be key to preventing serious cardiovascular disease down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the study shows very convincingly that exposure to one or more nonoptimal risk factors before these cardiovascular outcomes is nearly 100 percent," senior author and &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/09/nearly-everyone-has-at-least-one-risk-factor-before-a-heart-attack-stroke-or-heart-failure"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cardiologist Philip Greenland from Northwestern University &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/09/nearly-everyone-has-at-least-one-risk-factor-before-a-heart-attack-stroke-or-heart-failure"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in September when the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal now is to work harder on finding ways to control these modifiable risk factors rather than to get off track in pursuing other factors that are not easily treatable and not causal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenland and his co-authors note that their results challenge &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.06.045"&gt;recent claims&lt;/a&gt; that insidious cardiovascular events occurring in the absence of risk factors are increasing, suggesting that previous studies may have missed diagnoses or overlooked risk factor levels that were below the clinical diagnostic threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-protein-is-a-better-predictor-of-heart-disease-than-cholesterol"&gt;One Protein Is a Better Predictor of Heart Disease Than Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.030"&gt;&lt;span&gt;editorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Duke University cardiologist Neha Pagidipati (who was not involved in the study) argues that the results show just how important it is to manage health risks before they lead to serious, potentially fatal outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We can – and must – do better," she &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.030"&gt;&lt;span&gt;writes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.014"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2025.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            U.S. officials are building a case that ongoing measles &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/measles-cases-south-carolina-rise-by-nine-185-state-health-department-says-2026-01-02/" target="_blank"&gt;outbreaks in South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; and other states are unrelated to last year’s major outbreak in Texas, as it tries to retain its status of having eliminated the disease after recording the highest number of confirmed infections in three decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66q3lv00063b6srmi5munv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To be considered measles-free by the World Health Organization, a country must have no locally transmitted cases of the same strain for 12 months or longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66pid800003b6sxik24uoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists studying the issue say the elimination assessment may not be ironclad as it is difficult to be certain that all cases potentially linked to the Texas outbreak have been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qezm000d3b6s5it2ekm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A large outbreak of measles in Texas kicked off 2025 in January and spread to several states, followed by large outbreaks along the Arizona-Utah border and in South Carolina that continue to cause infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In November, the Pan American Health Organization - part of the WHO - determined that Canada had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/canada-has-lost-its-measles-elimination-status-says-ottawa-2025-11-10/" target="_blank"&gt;lost its measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; after nearly three decades due to its failure to curb a year-long outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qeqp000b3b6suaskfzy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PAHO this year will evaluate U.S. measles data, which involves 2,065 confirmed cases, to see if it can keep the measles elimination status it has had since 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qlve000j3b6scr4dvlm9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Former U.S. public health officials have described measles elimination status as a key indicator of a nation’s health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qlve000k3b6st2ptaaog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The United States will have to prove the ongoing measles cases are not related to the Texas outbreak, and were instead brought into the country from infected travelers, said William Moss, an epidemiology professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qlve000l3b6ssh6tzpwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State public health officials have used traditional methods of interviewing infected individuals to identify chains of transmission, as well as comparing the viral genotype - a section of the virus’ DNA - to see if cases are related. That still may not be sufficient to link cases in a large outbreak, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qlhh000h3b6seq4hhuzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kelly Oakeson, who leads next-generation sequencing at the Utah Public Health Laboratory, said none of the patients interviewed in Utah mentioned travel to Texas or contact with people from Texas, but many gave incomplete information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qsk6000r3b6sy69hokj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Based on the state’s detailed genetic analysis, however, he said the Utah strain is “different enough” from the Texas outbreak to suggest they are unrelated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qsk6000s3b6skyhndgji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We don’t think there is a direct link,” he said in an email, adding that the state has been working with CDC, Texas and Arizona to characterize transmission patterns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qsk6000t3b6sf9d3do7z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been analyzing the entire genetic code of virus samples to determine if the outbreaks are related, a newer technique that has not traditionally been used to assess measles transmission.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66qs7t000p3b6s7ganosrl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early evidence from the CDC analysis, which has not been made public, suggests the outbreaks are not related, according to two sources who have seen the data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o2000y3b6sdddgub0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a December 5 &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/1996961704417046752" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on X, CDC Acting Director Jim O’Neill said there was no epidemiological evidence linking the Texas outbreak and the ongoing cases in South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o2000z3b6shrouql19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A U.S. Health and Human Services spokesman confirmed that the CDC has found no epidemiological evidence linking ongoing outbreaks to Texas, but said many recent U.S. cases share the same genotype and have no known source of infection, “which could indicate ongoing domestic transmission.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200113b6sy15hbtpf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Noel Brewer, an infectious disease doctor at the University of North Carolina who has seen the CDC data, said the preliminary evidence suggests that new cases in Texas stopped in July and there was a three-week gap before the Utah-Arizona outbreak began.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200123b6sgrrbov76@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “No cases linked the two outbreaks in any clear way,” said Brewer, who chairs an independent committee that will analyze the U.S. data and make a report to PAHO on whether it agrees with the U.S. assessment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200133b6skqs69ysv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s inability to link the outbreaks, Brewer said, may simply reflect that the virus is circulating broadly in the United States and that it is “not possible at this time to track all of the cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200143b6secvaq8zj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are many gaps in epidemiological knowledge in the U.S. outbreaks and not all cases are identified or reported, said Johns Hopkins’ Moss, so you can miss cases linking two outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200153b6sgt7ygao2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, many of the larger U.S. outbreaks are occurring in communities that don’t trust the public health system and may be less likely to report cases or participate in an investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200163b6s353evx26@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That could lead scientists to incorrectly conclude that two viruses are different when it was just a sampling problem, Moss said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200173b6sob3j505y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, former CDC director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases who quit in August over &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/do-no-harm-why-three-cdc-officials-left-over-vaccine-policy-2025-08-28/" target="_blank"&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; about U.S. vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said PAHO will make the call based on the evidence it receives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk66r2o200183b6sdjy9o869@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If they don’t believe in the strength of one part of the data, and there are other compelling factors that say that the U.S. has lost elimination, it means that the U.S. has lost elimination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The virus is below flu rates, but certainly still infecting people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re still seeing a fair amount of COVID, kind of that background level with a little bit of a winter uptick as well,” Loafman added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playforth added that COVID rates in kids at her practice are increasing, but are low overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Daniel de la Hoz via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Daniel de la Hoz via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;By far, flu is the most prevalent winter virus infecting people right now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has been a surprisingly light season for respiratory syncytial virus. And one possibility is that ... we’re on our third year now with an effective vaccination against RSV,” said Martinello. “Especially in kids, there’s some thought that getting that vaccine out there has really made a dent in how this winter virus impacts the population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean the virus isn’t circulating at all, though. According to Playforth, there are “increasing numbers of RSV” among her patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC data shows that RSV isn’t infecting people at anywhere near the same rate as flu. Instead, RSV rates are currently low across the country, but hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="are on the rise" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="695c230ce4b0908b04a43f01" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Cold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also higher levels of the viruses that cause the common cold, said Martinello, “but not to the degree that we’ve seen increases with flu.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes rhinovirus, Loafman said, which is the virus that most often causes colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cold symptoms generally don’t bring people to the hospital. So it’s not surprising that a fairly high rate of influenza positive is showing up on our testing,” Loafman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to go get tested for the flu (or COVID) if they’re having more severe symptoms, while “people with just a common cold are tending to tough that out at home on their own,” Loafman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are straightforward ways to protect yourself from the circulating winter illnesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wish so much that there was a magic solution to help prevent all these illnesses,” Playforth said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There isn’t any one way to stay healthy all winter long, but there are things you can do to keep yourself and your loved ones safe from these viruses. &lt;/span&gt;First, it’s not too late for the flu shot. While the flu vaccine may not be a perfect match to the dominant flu strain this winter, it remains a valuable way to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is still one of the best things that you could do to minimize both your risk for getting flu and minimize your risk that if you do get flu, that it won’t be so severe that you need to go to the emergency department or that you need you’re sick enough to be hospitalized,” Martinello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for immunization against other circulating illnesses this winter — COVID-19 and RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For RSV: the monoclonal antibody shot ... is tremendously protective,” said Playforth. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Babies who are under 8 months (and whose mothers were not given the RSV vaccine during pregnancy) are eligible for this — and it works within hours of getting the injection.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines work. They’re safe and effective.

Lenny, the star of @lenwichthegolden, has taken this concept further by treating his family visits like a five-star vacation. The San Diego &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;‘s parents recently shared a video documenting his luxury itinerary, which includes private boat rides and relaxing pool dips. He clearly knows how to work the staff (read: family) to his advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever takes fans through a day at grandparents’ ‘resort’ in video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lenny explains that he starts every morning by “violently” waking up his parents before sprinting into the main house. From there, it’s a straight three-hour marathon of a game he calls “Bitey Face” with his cousins (two other dogs). Things usually get a bit too rowdy indoors once the cat gets involved. That leads to a quick banishment to the yard, though Lenny doesn’t seem to mind the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once there, he claims he won’t go in the pool, but the water is always too tempting to ignore. Afterwards, his strategy is actually quite brilliant: he convinces his grandpa that a boat ride is necessary since he’s already wet. He literally suggests being manipulative to get what you want, and the results are pretty hard to argue with. There is nothing like the wind in your ears while sprinting across a sandbar. Every minute on the water looks like pure, unadulterated joy for the pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The only real downside to his resort lifestyle is the inevitable bath time that follows the boat trip. Lenny accepts his fate, even while looking slightly ridiculous wrapped in a tiny head towel. Watching this Golden Retriever in the video proves that his vacation game is on another level. He only acts calm when it’s time for dinner with his humans. He stays under the table and waits for table scraps or a kiss from grandma, or when it’s cuddle time in front of the TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With over 12,100 likes, fans are already asking for the nightly rate of this furry paradise. One viewer joked that their new resolution is to be as manipulative as Lenny. Grandparents’ home really is “the perfect destination” for a pup needing a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/201922-golden-retriever-grandparents-house-resort-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Treats Grandparents’ House as a ‘Resort’;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Treats Grandparents’ House as a ‘Resort’&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:41:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPLWJOUnJtSk9lVnFRbFI0N2Q3TlRqS3VoR0UyU08tVFIyNkdwTnQ2UHdsbTVEVm5TbnhQWVZOZGIyVVVsbzlRZlhKa2FCX1VIbFhCZ3BYSFJCLUNSQkhQQU9aYlJ5OXdNSjhBZnQxU3k3V0FQRURQMkhDRjUzYXlYTFZaQ0Rud1NiMnZWaVdXRHVXM2l3MVNwNWUwSUdPemc</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现女性生育率随年龄下降的新线索--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/09/ivf-fertility-aging-eggs/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QBZ6XQLA2FHBTKZQ4NA3D56O3E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists are making inroads in understanding one of the central mysteries of human reproduction: Why do women’s eggs deteriorate as they age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P2SYEPKC7ZBGPLH2JDMF2EFQLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The broad strokes have been&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;well-known — the ticking of a woman’s biological clock increases risk of miscarriage and infertility, often caused by eggs with the wrong number of chromosomes, the structures that carry DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 11:32:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5UQXIxZlJtR1AtRUhZQ0JZT2lPZDV1U1ZneFczRmlvSDAwN3h4RVdVbHZQUXhTamZMYVhpSVBIc1F3NU5WTmRtT2JRWkhsV05ZTzdnVFBMMWNSdHNIQXVKaVY0QzJhcnJzMGJLdkJydGo4cEg4VTJMaGRxNlZ1LWM</guid></item><item><title>U4和U6 snRNA基因的从头和遗传显性变异导致视网膜色素变性-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02451-4</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class="c-article-author-affiliation__list"&gt;&lt;li id="Aff1"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-author-affiliation__address"&gt;Ophthalmic Genetics Group, Institute of Molecular and Clinical Ophthalmology Basel (IOB), Basel, Switzerland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-author-affiliation__authors-list"&gt;Mathieu Quinodoz, Karolina Kaminska, Ana Belén Iglesias-Romero, Mukhtar Ullah, Marc Folcher, Francesca Cancellieri &amp;amp; Carlo Rivolta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="Aff2"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-author-affiliation__address"&gt;Department of Ophthalmology, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-author-affiliation__authors-list"&gt;Mathieu Quinodoz, Karolina Kaminska, Ana Belén Iglesias-Romero, Marc Folcher, Georg Ansari, Francesca Cancellieri, Nicolas Feltgen, Maximilian Pfau &amp;amp; Carlo Rivolta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="Aff3"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-author-affiliation__address"&gt;Department of Genetics, Genomics and Cancer Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-author-affiliation__authors-list"&gt;Mathieu Quinodoz &amp;amp; Carlo Rivolta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="Aff4"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-author-affiliation__address"&gt;Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-author-affiliation__authors-list"&gt;Kim Rodenburg, Suzanne E. de Bruijn, Erica G.

			&lt;p&gt;A study in mice by researchers from Stanford University has traced the loss of cartilage that comes with aging to a single protein, pointing to treatments that may one day restore mobility and ease discomfort in seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein 15-PGDH has previously been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41573-025-00209-5"&gt;extensively linked to aging&lt;/a&gt;: it becomes more abundant as we get older, and interferes with the molecules that repair tissue and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led scientists to consider whether 15-PGDH might be involved in osteoarthritis, where stress on joints leads to the breakdown &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"&gt;of collagen&lt;/a&gt; in cartilage, causing inflammation and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/arthritis-affects-thousands-of-kids-and-one-piece-of-advice-is-crucial"&gt;Arthritis Affects Thousands of Kids, And One Piece of Advice Is Crucial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests on old mice, knee cartilage that had previously worn down thickened following the introduction of a 15-PGDH inhibitor. In similar tests on young, injured mice, the inhibitor offered protection against the usual effects of injury-induced osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers triggered the equivalent of an anterior cruciate ligament injury in mice and subsequently applied the treatment, osteoarthritis didn't develop, as would normally be expected in these kinds of mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts at cartilage regeneration included the use of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="187978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, a factor that was no longer necessary when 15-PGDH was inhibited. Instead, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte"&gt;the chondrocyte cells&lt;/a&gt; that make and maintain cartilage were being transformed into a healthier, more useful state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a new way of regenerating adult tissue, and it has significant clinical promise for treating arthritis due to aging or injury," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/joint-cartilage-aging-osteoarthritis-therapy-research"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; microbiologist Helen Blau. "We were looking for stem cells, but they are clearly not involved. It's very exciting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187981" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/MouseScans.jpg" alt="Cartilage scans" class="wp-image-187981 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/MouseScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/MouseScans-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187981" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Treated aged cartilage (far right, stained red) looked much more like young, healthy cartilage (far left, stained red). (Singla et al., &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treated mice had a steadier gait, suggesting they were experiencing less pain, and were shown putting more weight on their injured legs – signs that the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-have-a-hidden-salamander-like-ability-to-regenerate-body-tissue"&gt;cartilage restoration&lt;/a&gt; equated improved physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same experiment was also tried on human tissue samples taken from people having knee replacement surgery. Again, there were clear signs of regeneration, with the cartilage getting stiffer and showing fewer signs of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mechanism is quite striking and really shifted our perspective about how tissue regeneration can occur," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/joint-cartilage-aging-osteoarthritis-therapy-research"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; orthopaedic scientist Nidhi Bhutani. "It's clear that a large pool of already existing cells in cartilage are changing their gene expression patterns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And by targeting these cells for regeneration, we may have an opportunity to have a bigger overall impact clinically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there's still plenty of work to do, this could eventually lead to effective treatments to roll back the damage done by arthritis or aging in general. We could be heading towards a future where hip and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-s-now-an-artificial-cartilage-gel-that-s-strong-enough-to-work-on-knees"&gt;knee replacements&lt;/a&gt; are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides replacing the joints affected, current treatment options for osteoarthritis are limited to pain management. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/radiation-therapy-reduces-pain-from-the-most-common-form-of-arthritis"&gt;promising research&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, we don't have anything yet that tackles the root cause of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps could include a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="187978" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geroni/igaf122.3994"&gt;A previous trial&lt;/a&gt; of a 15-PGDH blocker to combat &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/protecting-your-muscle-mass-is-vital-for-healthy-aging-heres-why"&gt;muscle weakness&lt;/a&gt; didn't raise any red flags in terms of health and safety, which should speed up the process of trials for similar drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very excited about this potential breakthrough," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/11/joint-cartilage-aging-osteoarthritis-therapy-research"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Blau. "Imagine regrowing existing cartilage and avoiding joint replacement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adx6649"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk60wi1o006xbem2szmezvfz@published"&gt;This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/05/childhood-vaccine-immunization-schedule-overhaul/"&gt;sweeping changes to the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;, removing broad recommendations for immunization against such diseases as flu, hepatitis A, rotavirus, and meningitis. Until recently, the U.S. vaccine schedule called for routine protection against 17 diseases; the changes lower that number to 11 diseases. There’s &lt;a href="https://theunbiasedscipod.substack.com/p/and-what-have-we-done?utm_source=publication-search"&gt;no new science&lt;/a&gt; that would support such a colossal change, and the American Academy of Pediatricians and public health experts alike continue to recommend the evidence-backed former schedule. The &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/07/cdc-vaccine-recommendations-schedule-revisions/"&gt;unusually unilateral&lt;/a&gt; declaration comes a month after President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/12/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-begins-process-to-align-u-s-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/"&gt;issued a memorandum&lt;/a&gt; directing the CDC and the Secretary of Health and Human Services—aka longtime anti-vaccine activist RFK Jr.—to “align U.S. core childhood vaccine recommendations with best practices from peer, developed countries.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb1001v3b7bwijv9ff6@published"&gt;These “peer, developed countries” mentioned are Denmark, which recommends vaccinations for 10 diseases; Japan, which recommends 14; and Germany, which recommends 15. Fifteen! Fifteen is a lot more than America’s new number, 11, is it not? In the days since the new schedule announcement, vaccine experts have repeatedly pointed out that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/12/26/nx-s1-5656214/childhood-vaccination-denmark-rfk-policy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Denmark&lt;/em&gt; is actually the outlier&lt;/a&gt; from the “peer” countries for having such a parsimonious schedule. And there’s a key difference between us and Denmark: Denmark has free universal health care. If their health care system was a road, it would be smooth, and they’re able to drive the Porsche that is fewer vaccinations, epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina writes in her &lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/a-unilateral-change-to-childhood"&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt;. It would be silly—and dangerous—to attempt to drive that same Porsche through the hazardous terrain that is the U.S. health care system. But that is essentially what we’re doing, she says, by adopting a vaccine schedule akin to Denmark’s.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="203" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb1001w3b7b9bbyqz78@published"&gt;Because while Denmark has reliable prenatal care, consistent follow-up, and a national health registry that essentially tracks everyone from birth to death, the U.S. … well, the U.S. has literally none of those things. What we do have are the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/04/u-s-pregnancy-related-deaths-continuing-to-rise/"&gt;highest maternity mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4856058/"&gt;infant mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; among our “peer” countries. What’s more, we’re one of the only countries in the entire world that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/upshot/paid-leave-democrats.html"&gt;does not mandate any paid parental leave&lt;/a&gt;, alongside Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Tonga, and just a few others. Denmark, on the other hand, offers 24 weeks for the mother and 24 weeks for the father, plus a little more for the mother prior to the birth—nearly a &lt;a href="https://www.norden.org/en/info-norden/parental-benefit-denmark"&gt;year in total&lt;/a&gt;. That means that babies are able to stay home longer with their parents, avoiding exposure to diseases that they’re not yet vaccinated for, and that also present a higher mortality risk to infants than to even slightly older children. Americans don’t have the same opportunity. Most licensed child care centers &lt;a href="https://www.parents.com/daycare-for-infants-when-to-start-8622394#:~:text=Most%20licensed%20child%20care%20centers,the%20daycare%20center's%20policies%2C%20including:"&gt;accept babies as young as 6 weeks old&lt;/a&gt;, a choice that many parents are forced to make because they need to return to work (if they can &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/10/when-child-care-costs-more-than-rent-women-stay-at-home.html"&gt;afford the child care&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/01/theres-not-enough-child-care-in-the-u-s-for-all-the-families-that-need-it.html"&gt;whole other discussion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb1001x3b7bka9fdjyn@published"&gt;Day cares are germy places. “Anytime you have a gathering of kids in close quarters, you risk sharing germs,” says Elizabeth Murray, a pediatrician in Rochester, New York. And young children, who are still developing immunity to common germs and also like to stick their fingers in their mouth and eyes, share a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of germs. Research shows that in their first three years of life, kids in day cares &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-07/kids-who-go-to-childcare-get-sick-more-often-than-others/104053704"&gt;get sick more often&lt;/a&gt; with stomach bugs, ear infections, and upper respiratory infections than kids who are cared for at home (again, an option which, in the States, with our lean parental leave, can be very expensive for parents). The more kids there are in the child care setup, the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10995-012-1125-5"&gt;higher the rate&lt;/a&gt; of illnesses. Take some vaccines away from that equation—more illnesses still.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb2001y3b7bplgieci6@published"&gt;While states &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; still require that kids receive certain vaccines for day care even if they’ve been dropped from the recommended CDC vaccine schedule, it stands to reason that the new recommendations may influence some states to reduce their requirements too. So far, several states including &lt;a href="https://www.news10.com/capitol/cdc-vaccine-schedule-changes/"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://thebaynet.com/maryland-rejects-cdcs-new-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-will-use-aap-guidelines-instead/"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://lincolnchronicle.org/oregon-other-states-reject-trump-administrations-latest-vaccine-recommendations-for-kids/"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; have released statements that they’re rejecting the new CDC recommendations for school and day care entry requirements. It’s not yet clear what red states will do, though “we’re likely to see states going in very different directions with their own vaccine recommendations, largely along partisan lines,” says Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of public health at Yale University. A long piece in the Tallahassee Democrat titled “&lt;a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2026/01/06/florida-vaccination-rules-children-cdc-guidelines-reduces-recommended-immunizations/88045990007/"&gt;What Florida parents should know about new CDC vaccination guidelines&lt;/a&gt;” ultimately offers little to go by: “We have reached out to the Florida Department of Health to see what its plans are,” the reporter notes.&lt;/p&gt;

And “the more we encounter confusion around vaccines,” he says, “the more likely it is that more kids will not receive vaccines that they otherwise could or should.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmk61fvb200203b7bcun3kjm9@published"&gt;What’s certain is that more kids—and families—will suffer in various ways. Even outcomes that fall short of the very &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; outcome can still be horrible. Murray points out rotavirus, which lost its general recommendation status with the new schedule. While it’s not a major cause of death, the virus &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/vaccines/119330"&gt;comes with high costs&lt;/a&gt;: extremely brutal symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting for children, days of hospitalization, and the high medical bills that come with that. Not to mention the missed days of work—you can’t send your kid to child care when they are sick. “Boy, I definitely remember when we would admit a whole lot of children to the hospital with rotavirus,” says Murray. The vaccine, which was developed in 2006, “wiped it out. I haven’t seen rotavirus in well over a decade.” If rotavirus vaccination rates go down, that’s likely to change. Then there could soon be yet another bug to worry about when parents have to send their infants to day care so that they can head back to &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While the drugs slow the disease down, the benefits are minor, and they &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/22/uk-health-regulator-rejects-lecanemab-as-treatment-for-alzheimers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;have been rejected&lt;/a&gt; for widespread use by the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In searching for alternative therapies, scientists at UCL say drug developers should focus on two risk-raising variants of a gene named Apoe. Therapies designed to block the variants’ impact have “vast potential” for preventing the disease, they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Dylan Williams, a genetic epidemiologist at UCL, said: “Most Alzheimer’s disease cases would not arise without the contribution of just this single gene: Apoe. We need to think about it as a direct target. Almost all potential Alzheimer’s cases could benefit from Apoe-related interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More than half a million people in the UK, and more than 40 million worldwide, are living with Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. Several genes contribute to Alzheimer’s risk and lifestyle is important too: smoking, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol all make the disease more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Williams and his colleagues analysed medical records from more than 450,000 people of European ancestry to calculate how much Alzheimer’s disease arose due to different variants of the Apoe gene. People inherit two copies of the gene – one from each parent – and there are three main variants: Apoe2, 3 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists have long known that people with two copies of Apoe4 are high risk for Alzheimer’s, though 40% to 70% never develop the disease. The Apoe3 variant is widely considered neutral and the rare Apoe2 variant is regarded as protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Williams said we should see it another way. Compared with carrying two copies of Apoe2, both Apoe3 and Apoe4 raise the risk of Alzheimer’s, he said. Writing in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44400-025-00045-9" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;npj Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the team calculate that without these variants, 72% to 93% of Alzheimer’s cases, and about 45% of all dementia, would not have occurred. “If interventions could eliminate the detrimental effects [of Apoe3 and 4], we could expect to prevent most Alzheimer’s disease and a large proportion of all dementia,” they write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That is a big if. The Apoe gene is crucial for moving cholesterol and other fats around the body and brain, so knocking it out entirely is likely to cause problems. Future therapies might edit the gene variants, or dampen down their activity, but those are neither imminent nor risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Another problem is that the vast majority of people – more than 99% in the study – carry Apoe3 or Apoe4. So preventing Alzheimer’s would mean treating nearly the entire population, possibly through invasive gene editing of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study received a mixed reception. Tim Frayling, professor of human genetics at the University of Geneva, said claiming more than 90% of Alzheimer’s would not occur without the Apoe gene’s effects was like saying more than 90% of road traffic deaths would not occur without the contribution of cars. “People should not worry if they have the risk versions of the gene, because 99.4% of us do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:11,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&amp;quot;:true}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration at the University of Edinburgh, said understanding the risk factors that made the brain vulnerable to Alzheimer’s was “essential for developing effective treatments and prevention strategies”, adding that Apoe was one of the most important genetic risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Sheona Scales, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “Evidence around Apoe3 contributing to Alzheimer’s and dementia risk is significant, as this has been largely thought of as having a neutral effect on risk. However, it’s important to note that not everyone with these Apoe gene variations will go on to develop dementia, as other risk factors also have an influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This research raises lots of interesting questions, such as how Apoe3 and Apoe4 could drive Alzheimer’s risk, their effects in people of non-European ancestry, and whether targeting these variants could be a promising avenue for treatment and prevention of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Because of the complexity of Alzheimer’s risk, Apoe testing is not available on the NHS for people worried about their risk of developing Alzheimer’s in the future. If you are worried about your dementia risk, you should speak to your GP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 10:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNMnFnTXlQUlBPVERraFJNS29sM3I2NXY0cUVtZFFoUXprbGZiSU53R0QyRE1JWE5sS1pwMjFUUFVKRDNfQzdLQ0RjRDdUMGFlX09USFNfZHI3b1hycXpaZGtNc0d0Zjd3MkNuOXA0WFJVejhiTUdjSnViNXZHeDdQOUpvekt5SlJIVGpVS0N4VGFaRzdQbUhfaW8yckw5YzZ6Q1U0Y0VVLTZ2a2ZQcnFz</guid></item><item><title>科学家可能已经找到了迄今为止最聪明的方法来思考蛋白质-食品和葡萄酒</title><link>https://www.foodandwine.com/hybrid-proteins-healthier-and-more-sustainable-11878322</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 2025 study by Tufts University and the University of Massachusetts suggests that “hybrid” proteins — blends of plant-, mushroom-, insect-, and cultivated-meat sources — could balance nutrition, flavor, and sustainability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers found that combining different protein types can help overcome the shortcomings of each, including cost, texture, and environmental impact.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study highlights that hybrid foods may deliver the taste and texture consumers crave while reducing the carbon footprint and production challenges associated with single-source proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It feels like everyone, everywhere, all at once, is on a quest to find the perfect protein. And that vibe may be right on the money. Cargill's &lt;a href="https://www.cargill.com/meat-poultry/the-2025-protein-profile" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;2025 Protein Profile&lt;/a&gt; found that consumers are eating more protein than ever, with 61% reporting increased protein intake in 2024, up from 48% in 2019. The type of protein people choose can matter, especially given Consumer Reports' finding that many protein powders &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/protein-powder-heavy-metals-contamination-consumer-reports-investigation-11828759" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;contain high levels of lead&lt;/a&gt;. But as a new study by authors at Tufts University and the University of Massachusetts found, there is no single "right" protein. Instead, we should be aiming for a mix. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In 2025, researchers published their findings in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/science/articles/10.3389/fsci.2025.1599300/full" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, exploring how "hybrid" proteins could benefit human health and the planet. That means creating protein sources that draw on the best of each category, such as the "fibrous texture" of mushrooms, the "nutritional qualities" of cultivated meat, the "sustainability" of insects, and the low cost of plants. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Hybrid foods could give us delicious taste and texture without breaking the bank or the planet,” David L. Kaplan from Tufts University, and co-author of the study, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/30/mix-insect-plant-and-cultivated-proteins-for-healthier-greener-tastier-food" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;shared in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Using protein alternatives needn’t necessarily come with financial, taste, or nutritional costs.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand how each can work in tandem, the researchers reviewed various protein sources, including plant-based soy products, processed insect-based flours, vegan mushroom proteins, cultivated meats, and fermented products. For each product, they explained, they assessed the literature on its "strengths and weaknesses" when used with or without meat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They found that plant protein is often easy to produce at a reasonable price point but may lack the texture and flavor of meat that consumers are looking for, while cultivated meat can match that flavor profile, but is far too expensive right now to produce at scale. However, the authors argued that by combining them into a single product (think burgers made with meat and soy, or a small percentage of cultivated meat alongside mushroom protein, mixed together with flour made from insects), we could create a protein that is tastier, healthier, and has a smaller carbon footprint.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “No single alternative protein source is perfect, but hybrid products give us the opportunity to overcome those hurdles, creating products that are more than the sum of their parts,” David Julian McClements from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and co-author of the study, explained. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This isn't a hype dream, as the team also pointed to earlier studies showing that manufacturers could replace a "substantial" amount of animal meat in burgers with plant proteins without altering consumer perception of the product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, they caution that there is still a long way to go in both scientific research and consumer product testing to get the combination just right. As Kaplan noted, “To succeed, we need research and cooperation across science, industry, and regulators to improve quality, scale production, and earn consumer trust."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is “no rational justification remaining for prioritising or using” the surgical masks that are ubiquitous in hospitals and clinics globally, given their “inadequate protection against airborne pathogens”, they said in &lt;a href="https://whn.global/a-call-for-the-universal-use-of-respirators-in-healthcare/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a letter to WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There is even less justification for allowing healthcare workers to wear no face covering at all,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the height of the Covid pandemic an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/08/disposable-face-masks-covid-chemical-timebomb" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;estimated 129bn&lt;/a&gt;

It was authored by seven clinicians and scientists, including Finkel, and has been endorsed by almost 50 senior clinicians and researchers, and more than 2,000 members of the public, including clinically vulnerable patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There could be “off-ramps”, where governments or establishments decide respirators are not necessary, based on factors such as community infection rates, and ventilation or air filtration devices in a room, the letter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the suggested guidance would apply only in healthcare settings, where the risk of infection is higher, it is likely to provoke controversy. Face masks &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/08/08/with-face-masks-britain-imported-an-american-culture-war" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;became a culture war issue&lt;/a&gt; during the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In December, Tory leader &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/09/nhs-leader-calls-for-revival-of-mask-wearing-amid-tidal-wave-of-flu" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Kemi Badenoch said&lt;/a&gt; she had been “slightly traumatised by all the mask wearing that we had to do during Covid” in response to comments by an NHS leader saying people with flu symptoms “must wear” a face mask in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO cannot mandate global policies, but the signatories argue that an update to its infection prevention and control guidelines to recommend respirators could have a profound impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They also suggest that the WHO’s procurement infrastructure could help increase access to respirators even in poorer countries, with production of surgical masks phased down over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Surgical masks are still “better than nothing”, Finkel conceded, with studies suggesting they block approximately 40% of Covid-sized particles in the air, compared with 95% for respirators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He says the comparative reduction in risk can be thought of like falling off a wall of four inches rather than four feet: “You can still trip and break an ankle at four inches, but you’re much better off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critics of the group’s arguments point to &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/evidence/CD006207_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a lack of randomised controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; showing that physical measures slow the spread of respiratory viruses. Finkel and the other authors say such trials are simply not possible, for example because people in a trial will not wear masks 24/7 and could be exposed to pathogens while unmasked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead they say physical tests showing that respirators stop particles, conducted in laboratories, offer sufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="eaf47ec1-39ae-46e9-a57b-b83d49c107fe" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;FFP2 face masks being tested at Moldex-Metric, a German protective workwear manufacturer.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure id="6e178cb4-df19-43ff-ac13-09a13bc02403" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"World agrees pandemic accord for tackling outbreaks of disease","elementId":"6e178cb4-df19-43ff-ac13-09a13bc02403","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/20/world-agrees-pandemic-accord-for-tackling-outbreaks-of-disease-who-covid"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO has been criticised for being slow to describe Covid-19 as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/03/australia-prime-ministers-prize-for-science-lidia-morawska-covid-michael-wear-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-knowledge" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;spreading via “airborne” particles&lt;/a&gt; and the letter also calls for it to revisit earlier statements and “unambiguously inform the public that it spreads via airborne respiratory particles”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Trisha Greenhalgh of the University of Oxford, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00124-23" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whose research&lt;/a&gt; is cited extensively in the letter and is one of its signatories, said: “A germ that does not get inside someone cannot make them sick.

&lt;p&gt;But did it really? And has reducing the number of diseases all children are advised to be vaccinated against to 11 from 18 brought the United States in line with most other affluent countries?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two words. No and no. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A STAT analysis of vaccine recommendations in the United States and 37 other countries suggests that while the former U.S. schedule did aim to avert more diseases than the schedules of many other countries, it did so by only a few more diseases than in multiple other nations in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australasia. (The analysis drew the information from &lt;a href="https://immunizationdata.who.int/global?topic=Vaccination-schedule&amp;amp;location=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a World Health Organization database&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on information the WHO receives from its member countries; in the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ntpc.gov.tw/en/basic/?mode=detail&amp;amp;node=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;case of Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, information was drawn from its department of health website.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;South Korea, an economic powerhouse, recommends all children be vaccinated against 18 diseases, as does Brazil. Greece recommends vaccines against 17 diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(For the purposes of this analysis, STAT has counted antibody products that protect against respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, towards a country’s vaccine total, if it recommends the shot for all babies.)&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;In fact, the pared-down U.S. vaccine schedule now aims to protect children against fewer diseases than all but one of the 20 so-called peer countries whose schedules were &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/assessment-of-the-us-childhood-and-adolescent-immunization-schedule-compared-to-other-countries.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;presented by federal health officials as the rationale&lt;/a&gt; for the policy change. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That sole country is Denmark, an international outlier that currently recommends vaccines to protect against only 10 diseases for all children. But the country is in the process of assessing whether to add the chickenpox vaccine to its schedule, with the Danish Health Authority’s panel of vaccine advisers voting in December to green light a medical technology evaluation of the vaccine, the next step in a multi-step evaluation process, according to Jens Lundgren, an infectious diseases professor at the University of Copenhagen, who is on the committee. Lundgren said a final decision will likely come in the next year or so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The revised U.S. schedule also recommends vaccines against fewer diseases than a range of other countries including Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Brazil, China, Taiwan, and even the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau, whose childhood vaccination schedule includes vaccines to protect against 12 childhood diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The decision to carve certain vaccines out of the childhood schedule &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/05/childhood-vaccine-schedule-new-cdc-recommendation-11-shots/"&gt;was announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The U.S. is a global outlier among peer nations in the number of target diseases included in its childhood vaccination schedule and in the total number of recommended vaccine doses,” said the analysis used to explain the decision, written by Tracy Beth Høeg of the Food and Drug Administration and Martin Kulldorff of the Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Høeg, a sports medicine doctor who studied for a time in Denmark and is a dual American-Danish citizen, is the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/11/tracy-beth-hoeg-fda-cder-director-faces-staff-mistrust/"&gt;acting director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research&lt;/a&gt;. Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist, was recently named chief science and data officer for the assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at HHS. Both are political appointees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccine experts disagree with their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They want you to believe that we’re way out of sync, and that we give way more vaccines than everybody else. But we don’t,” said Anna Durbin, director of the Center for Immunization Research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 38 vaccine schedules that STAT analyzed recommended shots against an average of 14 diseases for all children. The only country that recommended vaccines against as few diseases as Denmark was Vietnam, which is in the process of adding &lt;a href="https://en.baochinhphu.vn/heath-ministry-to-add-four-more-vaccines-to-expanded-immunization-program-111240610170245145.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vaccines to protect against four diseases to its childhood schedule&lt;/a&gt; — including flu, rotavirus, human papillomavirus, and pneumococcal disease — by the end of the decade. Even among the 20 countries listed as peers in the Høeg-Kulldorff report, the average number of preventable diseases vaccinated against was 13.6.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But deciding on which vaccines to recommend for all children — which diseases and their consequences a country wants to help its children avoid — is not typically done by simply selecting a number, said William Moss, a professor of epidemiology at Hopkins and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just in terms of process, one could legitimately ask: Is the best way to determine the U.S. immunization schedule just by comparing it to other countries and kind of cherry-picking which country you want to follow per particular vaccine antigen?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Creating an immunization schedule is a complex process and there are multiple factors that play into it, including estimates of disease burden and the particular health care system,” Moss noted. “But I think it’s very important for the American public to understand that if a particular country like Denmark doesn’t include a vaccine, it’s not because they think that vaccine is harmful. It has to do with their own calculus, in their own country, their own situation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Anders Hviid, who heads the department of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark’s public health agency, concurred.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You cannot adopt the public health policies of another country unless the population, health care system and prevalence of infectious diseases match,” he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As many experts have pointed out, the differences between the demographics and disease-burden dynamics of the United States (population: 343 million) and Denmark (population: &lt;a href="https://www.dst.dk/en/Statistik/emner/borgere/befolkning/befolkningstal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;6 million&lt;/a&gt;) are profound — to say nothing of the fact that the latter has an effective universal health care system. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly adopted U.S. schedule focuses on 11 diseases: measles, mumps, rubella, polio, pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (also known as Hib), pneumococcal disease, human papillomavirus (HPV), and varicella or chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diseases that were targeted by the vaccines Høeg and Kulldorff recommended shaving off the schedule are: rotavirus, RSV, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, influenza, meningococcal disease, and Covid-19. The Trump administration, under health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had already moved to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/05/cdc-hepatitis-b-vaccination-acip-panel-overturns-30-year-policy/"&gt;eliminate the universal recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/19/what-acip-meeting-says-about-vaccine-schedule-rfk-restoring-trust-vaccines/"&gt;the one recommending Covid shots&lt;/a&gt; for all children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the new plan, the vaccines removed from the universally recommended schedule will be offered to children who are at risk of contracting the illness the vaccine protects against (RSV, hepatitis A and B, and meningococcal disease) if a way to figure out who is at risk can be determined. And all vaccines removed from the core schedule will still be available if parents want them for their children after having discussed the decision with their medical team. That’s a process called shared decision-making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparing the vaccine schedules of different countries is challenging for a number of reasons. The populations of some countries are exposed to some diseases that are not common elsewhere. The Japanese encephalitis vaccine is recommended for all children in some East Asian countries — Japan and South Korea among them. Brazil recommends vaccination against yellow fever, which is not a threat in North America or Europe. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some countries recommend HPV vaccines for girls only; some recommend both girls and boys should be vaccinated. Some recommend flu vaccine for all children, while others target certain age groups, such as schoolchildren, for their flu recommendations. If a country recommended HPV vaccine for all girls, STAT counted that as a universal recommendation, and if it recommended flu vaccine for all children in an age band, that also was counted as a universal recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RSV antibodies complicate assessing differences between countries. The two approved products given to babies to protect them during their first winter are used like a vaccine. They are administered via an injection. But they are not technically vaccines; they are inoculations of antibodies that arm an infant’s immune system to fend off a virus it hasn’t yet had a chance to generate its own protection against. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the RSV monoclonals were recommended for all children by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine use. The ACIP has treated the shots like a vaccine, including coverage of them in the Vaccines for Children program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Høeg and Kulldorff’s comparison of the U.S. schedule with those of peer nations, they do not list RSV monoclonals in their vaccine tallies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RSV monoclonals are new, and a number of countries are still in the process of deciding whether to offer them to all their children, and how to use them in conjunction with an RSV vaccine for pregnant people that arrived on the market at about the same time the first monoclonal was approved. Antibodies generated by the vaccine pass to a fetus in the womb, giving it protection during its first few months of life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lundgren, from Denmark’s Vaccination Council, noted, for instance, that that country opted to vaccinate pregnant people against RSV rather than recommend the antibody shots for all babies because studies showed mothers preferred that option and the country’s strong electronic records system made it possible to determine who had been vaccinated. Babies born pre-term, whose mothers haven’t yet been vaccinated, are given monoclonals, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kate O’Brien, director of immunization, vaccination, and biologics for the WHO, said national immunization technical advisory groups juggle a range of factors when making decisions about which vaccines to recommend for all children. Cost-effectiveness. The scale of the risk. The feasibility of figuring out whether a targeted program would get the job done or a universal recommendation is needed. (The U.S. adopted the recently jettisoned policy of recommending every child get hepatitis B vaccine at birth because targeting vaccination at children known to be at risk &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/11/newborn-hep-b-vaccine-debate-how-it-started/"&gt;was missing too many babies&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s nearly impossible to predict, on an individual basis, who is the child who’s going to have whatever outcome of whatever disease. So each [immunization advisory group] has to balance these decisions,” O’Brien said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She noted that internationally, there isn’t that much variability in the vaccines countries recommend for all their children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is true, though, that the United States under Kennedy takes a different approach to vaccination than it has for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It used to be very clear, from the direction of the program, that the U.S. saw itself as a program that was making an effort to optimize impact,” O’Brien said. “In other words, to prevent the most illness, to prevent the most serious outcomes, to prevent the most health harms by vaccinating.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That has resulted in a situation where diseases that were once ubiquitous, which sickened and sometimes killed babies, became for a while much rarer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The challenge now is that individual practitioners and individual parents have the beauty, the benefit that they grew up — and their children are growing up — in a society where these diseases are rare,” she said. “And the reason that they’re rare is because these vaccines have been used. When we stop using the vaccines, these diseases are coming back. There’s no ambiguity about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up to a pair of eyes staring intently at you is a unique kind of pressure. And Sophie, the creator behind @goodboy__bodie, deals with it daily, thanks to her best friend, Bodie. A recent video captures their morning ritual, which usually starts with a very intense staring contest. This &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; waits patiently by the mattress like he’s waiting for an invitation. He has this way of making sure you know he’s there without making a sound.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-video-shows-golden-retriever-s-morning-routine-with-mom-involves-a-staring-contest"&gt;Video shows Golden Retriever’s morning routine with mom involves a staring contest&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the video, Sophie sets her phone on the nightstand to show the standoff. Bodie sits patiently by the bed, waiting to get up. She then turns to look at him, and the staring contest begins. As Sophie puts it, “It’s always a staring match until he can tell I’m really awake lol.” She eventually adjusts the duvet as a signal. And on cue, he leaps up and immediately claims his spot on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sophie is clearly still half-asleep, but Bodie doesn’t rush her. He settles beside her, then slowly flops down right on top of her over the blankets. A few gentle pets follow. Some forehead scritches. Then they both stay completely still for a few beats. Bodie even rests his face on Sophie’s belly in a show of total contentment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If this feels familiar, it tracks. Bodie is known for leaning into relaxation. This is the same dog who happily lets his humans use a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/186498-golden-retriever-scalp-massager-reaction-video"&gt;scalp massager&lt;/a&gt; on him and lounges through &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/174692-video-dog-golden-retriever-massage"&gt;Theragun&lt;/a&gt; sessions without complaint. Comfort, for Bodie, is a lifestyle. And these quiet morning snuggles are just another way he recharges his battery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The internet is clearly obsessed with this routine. The post has earned over 44,600 likes from fellow dog parents. One fan noted that their bond is truly precious. Others commented that a fluffy wake-up call is the best way to start the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"Everybody smokes. Kids smoke in front of their parents. Yesterday, I went with some of my friends for dinner. You come home, you stink of tobacco."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this study important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;NPR noted that cancer rates are also increasing worldwide. While smoking may be the main culprit in Lebanon, we are now confronting a number of pollutants and chemicals that are increasing our risks for different types of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For instance, air pollution, which Mokdad noted is prevalent in Beirut, has been linked to a number of health problems, including respiratory issues and cancer. In fact, one new study found that women who live in more polluted areas suffer increased risks for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Airborne microplastics — which can be inhaled — also put people at risk for lung cancer, per another recent paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about cancer-causing pollutants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It's tough to prevent exposure to all cancer-causing pollutants, but one positive step is to quit smoking if you currently do. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/quit-smoking/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:resources and tips;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;resources and tips&lt;/a&gt; to help smokers kick the habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another thing anyone can do to reduce air pollution in our cities is to opt for carbon-free modes of transportation, such as &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/save-money-on-transportation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:biking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;biking&lt;/a&gt;, e-biking, or walking. Using public transportation can also help decrease pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reducing the amount of new microplastics entering the environment will help limit our exposure. The best way to do this is to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stop using;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;stop using&lt;/a&gt; so many single-use plastics.
