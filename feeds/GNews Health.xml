                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;New research reveals why adults cannot recall infant memories despite having formed them during early development.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Yale University researchers studied brain activity in 26 infants using fMRI scans while showing them images.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;The study found hippocampus activity was stronger in babies who were 12 months or older during memory encoding.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Researchers tracked infants' eye movements to determine which images they recognized from previous viewings.&lt;/li&gt;

            Do you ever wonder what it was like to be a baby? But no matter how hard you try, you can’t remember any of the details?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0004356mxzgfqjpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not that you don’t have memories from infancy — it’s that you simply can’t access them later in life, new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0005356mttk9xbbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adt7570" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, examined 26 infants ranging from 4.2 to 24.9 months, split into two age groups: those younger than 12 months and those 12 to 24 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0006356m6ldx4npa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the experiment, babies were placed in an &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri" target="_blank"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; machine and shown a series of unique images for two seconds each. Researchers aimed to record activity in the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus" target="_blank"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; — the portion of the brain associated with emotions, memory and the autonomic nervous system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0007356m09ipz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The hippocampus is a deep brain structure that is not visible to standard methods, so we had to develop a new approach for conducting memory experiments with babies inside an MRI machine,” said Dr. Nick Turk-Browne, lead study author and professor in the department of psychology at Yale University, via email. “This kind of research has previously been done mostly while infants are asleep, because they wiggle a lot, cannot follow instructions and have short attention spans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0008356mg3q3qd2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Simona Ghetti, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Davis, whose research focuses on the development of memory in childhood, acknowledged that while many studies have already demonstrated infants’ capacity to encode memories, this latest research is unique in that it links memory encoding to hippocampal activation. Ghetti was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0009356mcq2d1tp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After a momentary delay, the babies were then shown two images side by side: one of familiar images they had seen before and one that was new. Researchers tracked the babies’ eye movements, noting which image they focused on longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000a356m5exf4vug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If an infant spent more time looking at the familiar image, it suggested they recognized it, indicating memory recall. If they didn’t show any preference, it likely meant their memory was less developed, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000b356m3jpod1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eye movements have been used in hundreds of studies on infant memory and  categorization,” Ghetti said via email. “Infants look at what they find interesting, and researchers have long leveraged this spontaneous behavior to derive information about memory functioning.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2jioi0000356m6c6djnu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once they collected the initial data, the team analyzed fMRI scans of babies who looked at the familiar image longer, comparing them with those who had no preference. Trials were excluded if the baby wasn’t focused on the screen and moved or blinked excessively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000l356mm2f4iqht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings revealed that the hippocampus was more active in older infants when encoding memories. Additionally, only older infants exhibited activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15134840/" target="_blank"&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a key role in memory-related decision-making and recognition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000m356mwdwbfcr1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One thing we have learned about memory in adults is that the information we tend to capture and encode into memory are things that are highly relevant to our experience,” said Dr. Lila Davachi, a professor in the department of psychology at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “The amazing thing about this study is convincingly showing hippocampal encoding processes in babies for stimuli that are, in some sense, unimportant to them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000n356mimym7cw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s still unclear why memory encoding seems to be stronger in babies more than 12 months old, it’s likely a result of major alterations taking place in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000o356mi234e78e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant brain undergoes many perceptual, linguistic, motor, biological and other changes around this time, including the rapid anatomical growth of the hippocampus,” Turk-Browne said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000p356mkyq1i3wf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Turk-Browne and his team are actively working to test why the brain is unable to retrieve these early memories in life, but he speculates that the brain processing in infants may suggest the hippocampus isn’t receiving the accurate “search terms” to find the memory as it was stored based on the experiences the baby was having at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kwml000j356m9trz9z7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghetti encourages parents to think about the impact infancy has on their children, even if the children can’t retrieve memories they experienced at such an early age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000y356mxipkbbdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies are learning an enormous amount at this age, which is how they begin to take in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an entire language by associating sounds with meanings, Ghetti said. She added that infants are also forming expectations around their family members and studying properties of objects and the world around them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000z356masojst20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents often see this learned behavior when they sing the same song or read the same book, which Davachi&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;noted produces a familiar response in older children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0010356mf34dp69l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Using repetition with babies will open up a greater connection between parent and baby,” she said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0011356mc4pdm3l0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though you can’t recall those earliest memories as an adult, it’s fair to say that you’re learning from those experiences, which can be true for both neutral and emotional information, Ghetti said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “This can remind parents that infancy is not idle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;time&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and that infants are learning a great deal,” Ghetti said. “Offering opportunities for visual exploration may be important for cultivating learning skills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cod liver oil contains high levels of vitamin A, which is sometimes administered to measles patients under a physician's supervision. But the supplement is mostly a supportive treatment in children with vitamin deficiencies, and taking too much can cause toxicity. Nevertheless, Kennedy has touted the vitamin and falsely claimed that good nutrition protects against the virus, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/measles-outbreak-hits-208-cases-as-federal-outbreak-response-goes-off-the-rails/"&gt;much to the dismay of pediatricians&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They had a really good, quick recovery," the mother said of her other four children, attributing their recovery to the unproven treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tragic misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most children do recover from measles, regardless of whether they're given cod liver oil. The fatality rate of measles &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;is nearly 1 to 3 in 1,000 children&lt;/a&gt;, who die with respiratory (e.g., pneumonia) or neurological complications from the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommey noted that the sibling who died didn't get the alternative treatments, leading the audience to believe that this could have contributed to her death. She also questioned what was written on the death certificate, noting that the girl's pneumonia was from a secondary bacterial infection, not the virus directly, a clear effort to falsely suggest measles was not the cause of death and downplay the dangers of the disease. The parents said they hadn't received the death certificate yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tommey then turned to the MMR vaccine, asking if the mother still felt that it was a dangerous vaccine after her daughter's death from the disease, prefacing the question by claiming to have seen a lot of "injury" from the vaccine. "Do you still feel the same way about the MMR vaccine versus measles?" she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yes, absolutely; we would absolutely not take the MMR. The measles wasn't that bad, and they got over it pretty quickly," the mother replied, speaking again of her four living children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So," Tommey continued, "when you see the fearmongering in the press, which is what we want to stop, that is why we want to get the truth out, what do you say to the parents who are rushing out, panicking, to get the MMR for their 6-month-old baby because they think that that child is going to die of measles because of what happened to your daughter?"&lt;/p&gt;

            Do you ever wonder what it was like to be a baby? But no matter how hard you try, you can’t remember any of the details?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0004356mxzgfqjpx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not that you don’t have memories from infancy — it’s that you simply can’t access them later in life, new research shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0005356mttk9xbbu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adt7570" target="_blank"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, examined 26 infants ranging from 4.2 to 24.9 months, split into two age groups: those younger than 12 months and those 12 to 24 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0006356m6ldx4npa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the experiment, babies were placed in an &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/25034-functional-mri-fmri" target="_blank"&gt;fMRI&lt;/a&gt; machine and shown a series of unique images for two seconds each. Researchers aimed to record activity in the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus" target="_blank"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; — the portion of the brain associated with emotions, memory and the autonomic nervous system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0007356m09ipz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The hippocampus is a deep brain structure that is not visible to standard methods, so we had to develop a new approach for conducting memory experiments with babies inside an MRI machine,” said Dr. Nick Turk-Browne, lead study author and professor in the department of psychology at Yale University, via email. “This kind of research has previously been done mostly while infants are asleep, because they wiggle a lot, cannot follow instructions and have short attention spans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0008356mg3q3qd2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Simona Ghetti, a professor in the department of psychology at the University of California, Davis, whose research focuses on the development of memory in childhood, acknowledged that while many studies have already demonstrated infants’ capacity to encode memories, this latest research is unique in that it links memory encoding to hippocampal activation. Ghetti was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi0009356mcq2d1tp5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After a momentary delay, the babies were then shown two images side by side: one of familiar images they had seen before and one that was new. Researchers tracked the babies’ eye movements, noting which image they focused on longer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000a356m5exf4vug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If an infant spent more time looking at the familiar image, it suggested they recognized it, indicating memory recall. If they didn’t show any preference, it likely meant their memory was less developed, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2k6fi000b356m3jpod1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Eye movements have been used in hundreds of studies on infant memory and  categorization,” Ghetti said via email. “Infants look at what they find interesting, and researchers have long leveraged this spontaneous behavior to derive information about memory functioning.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2jioi0000356m6c6djnu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once they collected the initial data, the team analyzed fMRI scans of babies who looked at the familiar image longer, comparing them with those who had no preference. Trials were excluded if the baby wasn’t focused on the screen and moved or blinked excessively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000l356mm2f4iqht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings revealed that the hippocampus was more active in older infants when encoding memories. Additionally, only older infants exhibited activity in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15134840/" target="_blank"&gt;orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a key role in memory-related decision-making and recognition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “One thing we have learned about memory in adults is that the information we tend to capture and encode into memory are things that are highly relevant to our experience,” said Dr. Lila Davachi, a professor in the department of psychology at Columbia University, who was not involved in the study. “The amazing thing about this study is convincingly showing hippocampal encoding processes in babies for stimuli that are, in some sense, unimportant to them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000n356mimym7cw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though it’s still unclear why memory encoding seems to be stronger in babies more than 12 months old, it’s likely a result of major alterations taking place in the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000o356mi234e78e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant brain undergoes many perceptual, linguistic, motor, biological and other changes around this time, including the rapid anatomical growth of the hippocampus,” Turk-Browne said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kyah000p356mkyq1i3wf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Turk-Browne and his team are actively working to test why the brain is unable to retrieve these early memories in life, but he speculates that the brain processing in infants may suggest the hippocampus isn’t receiving the accurate “search terms” to find the memory as it was stored based on the experiences the baby was having at the time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2kwml000j356m9trz9z7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ghetti encourages parents to think about the impact infancy has on their children, even if the children can’t retrieve memories they experienced at such an early age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000y356mxipkbbdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies are learning an enormous amount at this age, which is how they begin to take in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;an entire language by associating sounds with meanings, Ghetti said. She added that infants are also forming expectations around their family members and studying properties of objects and the world around them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e000z356masojst20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents often see this learned behavior when they sing the same song or read the same book, which Davachi&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;noted produces a familiar response in older children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0010356mf34dp69l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Using repetition with babies will open up a greater connection between parent and baby,” she said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0011356mc4pdm3l0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though you can’t recall those earliest memories as an adult, it’s fair to say that you’re learning from those experiences, which can be true for both neutral and emotional information, Ghetti said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8g2ll8e0012356mdwfd7362@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This can remind parents that infancy is not idle&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;time&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and that infants are learning a great deal,” Ghetti said. “Offering opportunities for visual exploration may be important for cultivating learning skills.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

This evolution, they caution, suggests that older vaccine formulas may lose effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows a trend of weakening binding affinity of existing antibodies against H5 isolates over time, indicating that the H5N1 virus is evolving immune escape from our therapeutic and immunological defenses,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rapid-shifts-in-bird-flu-virus"&gt;Rapid shifts in bird flu virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running large-scale computational models of specific viral proteins binding with neutralizing antibodies, the research team discovered “an overall worsening in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/experts-have-found-powerful-antibodies-that-neutralize-all-covid-variants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; affinity to more recent H5N1 isolates.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one makes an H5N1 vaccine with a previous vaccine candidate virus, the vaccine will have less efficacy, based on our measurements of how much the virus has evolved in recent years,” explained lead author Colby T. Ford, a visiting scholar at UNC Charlotte’s &lt;a href="https://cipher.charlotte.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Center for Computational Intelligence to Predict Health and Environmental Risks&lt;/a&gt; (CIPHER).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducted under the guidance of assistant professor Richard Allen White III, and CIPHER co-director Daniel Janies, the UNC Charlotte team joined forces with &lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt; (MIT) researchers Rafael Jaimes III and Phillip J. Tomezsko to explore how the H5N1 virus is adapting so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mounting-zoonotic-risk"&gt;Mounting zoonotic risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing 1,804 antigen-antibody interactions, the researchers examined how the virus’s hemagglutinin subunit changed from 1996 to 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying high-performance computational techniques, they tracked the virus’s “antigenic drift” – small cumulative mutations that hamper the effectiveness of immune defenses from earlier infections or vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new measurements of how much the bird flu virus has evolved in recent years confirmed that H5N1 is becoming less recognizable to established antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results indicate that the virus has potential to move from epidemic to pandemic status,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emergence-across-multiple-species"&gt;Emergence across multiple species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though H5N1 has primarily circulated in birds, it has jumped to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/avian-influenza-h5n1-marine-mammals-spreading-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt; and, rarely, to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past year, the virus was found in dairy cattle in at least 17 U.S. states, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) reported 70 human cases, including one fatality, in the United States since January 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, H5N1 has been linked to 466 human deaths since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between January 2022 and March 2025, the CDC also documented 12,510 H5N1 outbreaks among wild birds within the U.S., virus detections in 51 jurisdictions and 166,417,923 affected poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such widespread, cross-species infections strongly indicate that avian influenza can be considered a pandemic among animal populations, raising fears of a future human pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-birds-flu-vaccination-and-public-health"&gt;Birds flu vaccination and public health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In discussing how to avert the looming threat, the authors argue that a new approach to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/universal-influenza-vaccine-could-offer-lifetime-immunity/"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; development may be needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that once the bird flu virus modifies itself significantly, older vaccines will have less efficacy, making it essential to develop and regularly update H5N1 vaccines reflecting the virus’s continuous genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the study’s results highlight the power of high-performance computing in mapping viral evolution. By integrating AI-based protein folding with physics-based simulations, researchers can anticipate changes in viral structure and better inform policy decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bird-flu-s-potential-for-pandemic-status"&gt;Bird flu’s potential for pandemic status&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With H5N1 already widespread among wild birds and expanding its foothold in mammalian hosts, the virus’s cross-species jumps present a significant concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, more robust monitoring, updated vaccination strategies, and ongoing computational analyses will be crucial in mitigating a potential outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Janies concluded, computational modeling can help experts “tune our intuition to the right approaches” for vaccine design and intervention strategies before a fast-adapting virus gains an uncontrollable edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 17:40:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxNSTZadGNfdzk0QXhJOWFZWDdYdHNzZXEzVVAwRWZMOG5YY1dtemFWYVdGRWJDVFNZWkd1T1A0VVc4c1J6RUs4UXhWQkhJQXhZNUpRRHA3ZEFOMmhGOVc0VEwyQXVJS0xpVUN4dEV4RFVpc0dSY1lTM01Zc0wyWkF2b2lSNXlpdEtvX1pVMEREUVk</guid></item><item><title>NJ high school student tests positive for tuberculosis - Gothamist</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQeTcwTFR3bVppQnAzWFhyVDlmbTZkYlYzdERveE1ER0xyYWlKQ19PdkRtVmg0bWVJRjdMM0Q0ZmltbFltMjNGNGw4SkJVNmItSWJxUjlQT2tQM0lrc2JORlRUcXZkNVJKaVQtUHRBRFJReVRXczZWM2xHaU04cWIwZHhfMTdNWHZJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high school student in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, has tested positive for tuberculosis, according to a letter from the principal to the school community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this time, the student is being treated and is doing well,” Colonia High School Principal Christopher Chiera wrote in a letter dated March 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School officials are working with the Middlesex County Office of Health Services to identify students and staff who may have been exposed to the student, according to the letter. It said anyone identified as a “close contact” will be screened for the disease. Tuberculosis, a bacterial illness, can be fatal if not properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate comment from the county health services office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The positive case comes as the number of reported tuberculosis cases in New Jersey and across the United States has been on the rise since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the year for which most recent data is available, most states reported an increase in tuberculosis cases, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/reporting-area.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

For the same period, New York City had an incidence rate of 8.3 cases per 100,000 persons, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/reporting-area.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; data. The remainder of New York state had an incidence rate of 1.9 cases per 100,000 persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis mainly affects the lungs but can also damage the kidneys, liver, heart, bones, joints, and blood vessels.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents of an &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.latintimes.com/rfk-jr-called-out-democratic-lawmaker-not-answering-him-live-broadcast-respond-damn-letter-578440"&gt;unvaccinated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.latintimes.com/search/site/Texas"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; child who died from &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.latintimes.com/second-measles-death-confirmed-unvaccinated-adult-tests-positive-posthumously-577822"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; appeared in a video formulated by an anti-vaccine advocacy group where they railed against vaccines, even saying the disease "wasn't that bad.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 6-year-old Texan died after contracting measles last month, marking the &lt;a href="https://www.latintimes.com/unvaccinated-child-first-decade-die-measles-texas-outbreak-576854" rel="nofollow"&gt;first death&lt;/a&gt; of a child in the U.S. caused by the highly contagious illness in nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following her death, the anti-vaccine advocacy group Children's Health Defense met with the child's parents, whose four other children also suffered from milder cases of the same illness, as reported by &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-measles-childrens-health-defense/" target="_blank"&gt;Mother Jones.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the interview, the young couple doubled down on their decision not to vaccinate their child even after her death. Hailing from the Mennonite community, they argued that if measles patients had access to untested treatments, the MMR vaccines would be entirely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We spent the morning at Dr. Ben Edwards' clinic, and the parents are all still sitting there saying they would rather have this than the MMR vaccination because they've seen so much injury, which we have as well," journalist Polly Tommey said while interviewing the couple. "Do you still feel the same way about the MMR vaccine versus measles and the proper treatment with Dr. Ben Edwards?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Absolutely [do] not take the MMR [vaccine]," said the mother. "The measles wasn't that bad. [The other children] got over it pretty quickly. And Dr. Edwards was there for us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parents described the symptoms of the illness their child exhibited, beginning with a fever, respiratory symptoms and the notorious rash that often accompanies it. However, days after contracting the illness, the child's fever continued and respiratory symptoms worsened as she began struggling to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl's parents took her to a hospital emergency room where she was admitted and diagnosed with pneumonia. After being placed on a ventilator in the Intensive Care Unit, the child passed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak in Texas has spurred many public and &lt;a href="https://www.latintimes.com/top-hhs-spokesperson-quit-due-rfk-jrs-muted-response-measles-outbreak-days-before-kennedys-577361" rel="nofollow"&gt;political figures&lt;/a&gt; to take to their platforms and encourage residents to get vaccinated and vaccinate their children.

Kennedy Jr, the man in charge of the USA's health policy, has come up with a new plan for tackling the potential threat of bird flu: let it spread like wildfire through farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, avian influenza is devastating chickens in the US, with &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/over-20-million-us-chickens-killed-by-bird-flu-contributing-to-egg-price-rises-77639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;over 20 million&lt;/a&gt; birds dying of the disease, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). At the moment, though the infection has caused many distressing deaths in poultry and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/new-h5n1-bird-flu-virus-genotype-found-in-us-cows-in-second-spillover-event-77933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;livestock&lt;/a&gt;, humans are relatively safe from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since April 2024, 70 human cases of avian influenza A(H5) virus infection have been reported in the United States. Of these, 41 cases were associated with exposure to sick dairy cows and 26 were associated with exposure to avian influenza A(H5N1) virus-infected poultry," the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The source of the exposure in three cases, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/h5n1-bird-flu-spreading-silently-in-us-as-cdc-data-reveals-unknown-infections-in-vets-78052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;could not be determined&lt;/a&gt;. To date, human-to-human transmission of influenza A(H5) virus has not been identified in the United States. The immediate risk to the general public from H5 bird flu remains low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-concerned-do-we-need-to-be-about-bird-flu-in-the-us-77916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;might not always&lt;/a&gt; be the case. As the world no doubt remembers from COVID-19, all it takes is a few mutations for a disease to spread amongst humans. Proper management of the disease in birds – including culling infected animals, enhancing biosecurity, and reporting of cases – is needed to keep the disease from making that &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-spillover-events-propel-animal-diseases-into-human-populations-67727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;sustained leap to humans&lt;/a&gt;, where human-to-human transmission could develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent interview with Fox News, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, US Secretary of Health and Human Services, outlined a different idea, saying farmers “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it," per &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though decisions on farm policy fall to the USDA rather than the health department, agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins has floated the same idea, reportedly telling Fox News “there are some farmers that are out there that are willing to really try this on a pilot as we build the safe perimeter around them to see if there is a way forward with immunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with this idea? Just about everything, according to experts. The primary risk to humans is that letting it loose through farms would give the virus more chance to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/first-severe-human-infection-of-bird-flu-virus-in-the-us-shows-signs-of-mutation-77410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mutate&lt;/a&gt; into one that can be transmitted from human to human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"Every new infection in an animal and person is like throwing a pair of thousand-sided dice," Dr James Lawler of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's Global Center for Health Security in Omaha told &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/birdflu/114731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;MedPageToday&lt;/a&gt;. "It may take a while, but eventually it will come up snake-eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kennedy claimed that some chickens may have natural immunity to the disease, which could be identified as the virus devastates a flock, experts are not impressed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"The way we raise birds now, there's not a lot of genetic variability," Dr Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas, added to The New York Times. "They're all the same bird, basically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;"You’re setting yourself up for bad things to happen,” Hansen added. “It’s a recipe for disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being terrible for humans, the disease causes a lot of pain and discomfort for the birds, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/virus-transmission/avian-in-birds.html#:~:text=Low%20Pathogenic%20Avian%20Influenza%20(LPAI,virus%20as%20those%20birds%20migrate." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;nearly all&lt;/a&gt; of which will end up dying of the disease. &lt;a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/avian-influenza-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Symptoms include&lt;/a&gt; respiratory distress, coordination loss and tremors, swollen heads, and hemorrhages.

They discussed the medications that could increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, a group of neurological disorders that impact memory, language, problem-solving, and other cognitive abilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Association, an estimated 6.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease in 2023. Dr Helman's warning comes as that number is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6195005/Alzheimers-burden-DOUBLE-2060-CDC-report-warns.html"&gt;expected to double by 2060&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@robertwblove/video/7481346201606999339"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt; with neuroscientist Robert Love, Dr Helman pointed to antihistamines as one type of drug that could increase the risk fo Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Available over-the-counter or with a prescription, the most popular examples include Benadryl, Zyrtec, Claritin, and Clarinex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antihistamines block the effects of histamine, a chemical released by the body during an allergic reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, antihistamines like Benadryl have also been shown to block the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which Dr Helman notes is 'very important for nerve transmission.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acetylcholine carries messages from the brain to the body through nerve cells, controlling functions like memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drugs like Benadryl are considered anticholinergics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with Alzheimer's disease have been shown to have low acetylcholine in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2514553"&gt;2016 study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 450 adults found that patients taking anticholinergics had greater levels of brain atrophy or wasting than those not on them, a sign of dementia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Helman said: 'I'm not saying never take Benadryl, but what I am saying is you don't want to be taking these types of medications every night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're taking something like Benadryl every night, you're actually slowly leading to brain damage.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Common allergy medications like Benadryl may block important brain pathways for memory, Dr Helman said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Helman also pointed to benzodiazepines, nicknamed 'benzos' or 'downers.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include prescription drugs Valium, Xanax, Ativan, and Klonopin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Benzodiazepines act as sedatives, slowing down activity in the brain and nervous system by activating the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03437-5"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt; of more than 5,000 older adults suggested the use of benzodiazepines was associated with shrinking of the brain's memory centers, the hippocampus and the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these areas of the brain naturally shrink with age, the process appeared to occur faster in patients on benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause symptoms of dementia like memory loss.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors wrote: 'It is important to carefully consider the necessity of prolonged benzodiazepine use in light of potential detrimental effects on brain health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Helman cautioned against quitting these medications altogether and instead suggested speaking with your doctor to avoid withdrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/two-types-of-drugs-you-may-want-to-avoid-for-the-sake-of-your-brain#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%20the%20greater%20people's%20cumulative%20dose%20of%20benzodiazepines%2C%20the%20higher%20their%20risk.&amp;amp;text=But%20those%20who%20had%20taken%20a%20benzodiazepine,risk%20than%20those%20who%20hadn't%20taken%20one."&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in France and Canada found that people who had taken a benzodiazepine for three to six months had a 32 percent increased risk of developing Alzheimer's compared to those who had never taken one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those on one of these drugs for more than six months were at an 84 percent increased risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chronic benzodiazepine use has also been shown to reduce the brain's neuroplasticity, or its ability to change or adapt over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could lead to the brain's neurons degrading over time, leading to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Helman also warned against the prolonged use of statins, a drug taken by 92million Americans to lower cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Statins work by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase which produces cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the science on statins and Alzheimer's disease has been mixed, several recent reports show the drugs could lead to cognitive issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/62/supplement_1/102"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found patients with mild cognitive impairment - a precursor to Alzheimer's disease - were more than twice as likely to develop dementia from taking statins like lipohilic statins like Lipitor than those not on these medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said this could be because scans showed these patients had declines in the posterior cingulate cortex, the region of the brain most affected by early stages of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other studies have suggested statins may protect against Alzheimer's disease, so research is still mixed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 16:02:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Terrifying zombie drug detected in US-Mexico border drug supply for first time - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOYkNzV0QwMFBhTWQyN0FwT2h1WnRzZTZLZ1pnRFRXMVBXaGROTWIxcnpxQ0ZST0NNWHhDUlR2eEV1SGlYbEdpelRxMFgwVUd2Z1R0b0ltLXR1Q2FRR0NFemNNSGcyX2RBY2M1dFFxLWVLdTEyVmpwQ0hjRnhUZ0V3a09jN3NFSjRsbzFWcjNLVm1yaXR3MzlTQ2NWQ20tNjBLalHSAacBQVVfeXFMUE5zdlZRUFBlUmRCakx2cW92NWhwbDBxWDAyU0RBV0lHRkd0dEJ3OVJoWURURVgzNjN1WDhxSG13enM5UXpWRWJDaVFmdGowd3NzYXQ2RFZiUzhWNkQxVjc5V1NERW03SXVIbUlvenBRZ1Ewc1VnU2h4OGpjYklpalp2dGFrenRhTDNoQWNwOUVLYjVxYVNVMm1uRU0za1paa1ByOGRfdjg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are sounding the alarm about the 'zombie drug' xylazine coming into the US through the southern border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The animal tranquilizer, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12320227/The-deadliest-threat-Americas-faced-Mass-produced-China-trafficked-Puerto-Rico-available-online-just-1-KILO-flesh-rotting-zombie-drug-tranq-DEA-terrified.html"&gt;added to street drugs&lt;/a&gt; to make them more potent, has been linked to thousands of US overdose deaths per year since the Covid pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the deaths have been on the East Coast where there are several ports of entry for international goods, but now there are growing concerns the drug could permeate countless other cities and spark a fresh wave of the drug epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the first time, researchers have confirmed in a new study that it is being smuggled into the US through &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/mexico/index.html" id="mol-c6fecdb0-059c-11f0-b8b1-05fefb9680eb" class=""&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, after testing urine and drug paraphernalia samples from a border town clinic and found xylazine in about 83 percent of them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Xylazine, sometimes &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12083305/Flesh-eating-zombie-drug-tranq-takes-LA-streets-users-rotting-skin-seen.html"&gt;known as 'tranq'&lt;/a&gt;, is often mixed with fentanyl to augment the high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12902125/Unhappy-holidays-Grim-photos-tranq-addicts-shooting-broad-daylight-sidewalks-Philadelphia-fentanyl-tranq-overdoses-run-rampant.html"&gt;typically injected&lt;/a&gt;, which causes blood vessels to constrict to the point where they cannot carry oxygenated blood throughout the body, starving tissues of oxygen and causing skin to rot and die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joseph R. Friedman, a psychiatrist at UC San Diego School of Medicine and lead author of the new study, said: ‘Although xylazine has been most prevalent on the East Coast of the United States, this new evidence confirms its presence in Tijuana, on the U.S.-Mexico border, posing numerous health risks for people in this region.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Xylazine, a veterinary sedative, is the latest substance to appear in the illicit drug supply. Officially used to tranquilize animals, it’s increasingly being mixed with fentanyl and consumed by injection or snorting &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tijuana is a major port of entry and the final checkpoint on the path that traffickers take to pass their products &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-9326877/How-NINE-Mexican-cartels-responsible-flooding-streets-United-States-drugs.html"&gt;through Mexico and into the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city sits atop a labyrinth of tunnels complete with lighting and ventilation systems drug traffickers wind through to pass their products to American hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reported last spring that deaths involving both fentanyl and xylazine across 20 states and DC increased from 3 percent in January 2019 to 11 percent in June 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Xylazine-related overdose deaths in the US rose from 102 in 2018 to 3,468 in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By 2022, xylazine was detected in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7226a4.htm#F1_down"&gt;nearly 11 percent&lt;/a&gt; of fentanyl-related deaths across 20 states, the equivalent of around 5,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers, funded, in part, by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute of Mental Health, looked at anonymous records from a free clinic in the town.&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They tested urine samples and drug paraphernalia collected from 23 patients who had admitted to using illegal opioids in the previous 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the patients had used fentanyl, and most had used methamphetamine or heroin. Xylazine was detected in 19 urine samples and on 15 needles, pipes, and baggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Xylazine is often mixed in with fentanyl to augment the high that users experience. Drug seizures by border officials have risen steadily over the past six or seven years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to xylazine and fentanyl, test strips also detected black tar heroin, meth, lidocaine, and tramadol, a prescription opioid, in urine and paraphernalia samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fifteen of the 23 subjects – 22 of whom were men – were unhoused when they went to the clinic, and seven of them had severe skin lesions at the time of their visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Xylazine constricts blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When bodily tissues don’t get the oxygen they need, they die, leading to open sores and ulcers on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If those gaping sores go untreated, they can result in a devastating infection that can require amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America’s streets, already contending with a flood of deadly fentanyl in the illicit drug supply, are increasingly seeing it cut with the veterinary tranquilizer drug xylazine, which leaves users in a zombie-like state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug is not an opioid but is often mixed with opioids — such as fentanyl — to augment the high and reduce the number of times an addict needs to get a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also determined that test strips returned false positives in samples that were found to contain the sedative lidocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Xylazine constricts blood vessels, reducing oxygen flow to tissues. This oxygen deprivation causes tissue death, leading to open sores and ulcers on the skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was only after conducting more rigorous, highly precise testing that they detected xylazine, suggesting that drug users with test strips may still be unknowingly taking tranq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, researchers argue test strips are worthwhile, as not all samples contained lidocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Friedman said: ‘This study underscores the importance of expanding drug-checking efforts in border regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our findings also support the use of xylazine test strips as a harm reduction tool, providing people who use drugs and healthcare providers with critical information about exposure risks.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest findings were published in the Journal of Addiction Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Xylazine is increasingly appearing in drug seizures by customs and the Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The DEA said in September 2023 that the drug had &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dea.gov/stories/2023/2023-09/2023-09-22/dea-and-dhs-issue-joint-update-sources-illicit-xylazine?fbclid=IwY2xjawJJBJhleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHd54bzWb7MdxEFFIhr2YSNfrnhKdNgbr8peI6AJQG7wwsNvm7y9l1Nupog_aem_2Vxkdet1Wyuo6b8nkfHbPQ"&gt;entered the US in several ways&lt;/a&gt; – ‘in solid form from China and other countries, in liquid form either diverted from veterinary supply chains or packaged to resemble a veterinary drug, and, to a lesser degree, mixed with fentanyl seized at the southwest border.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug comes from Europe, as well. Last fall, Customs and Border Protection officers in Philadelphia intercepted a package containing a kilo of xylazine that had shipped from Spain and was labeled ‘mica powder for makeup.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;By 2022, xylazine was detected in nearly 11 percent of fentanyl-related deaths across 20 states, the equivalent of around 5,000 deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adam Streetman, CBP's Area Port of Philadelphia Director, said at the time: ‘Customs and Border Protection officers know the challenges our country faces in protecting our citizens from the deadly threats posed by dangerous drugs trafficked by transnational criminal organizations, including dangerous synthetics like xylazine, and from fentanyl and fentanyl precursors.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most powerful and well-organized trafficking organization in Mexico is the Sinaloa Cartel, spearheaded by El Chapo Guzman since the 1980s until his most recent imprisonment in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cartel drives the bulk of fentanyl trafficking into the US. Less is known about its role in producing and distributing xylazine, though the Sinaloa Cartel is known to mix its supplies with other substances to keep customers wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Did he want to die at home, or in the hospital?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Coates, then 37 and living in Renton, Wash., was barely conscious. For months, he had been battling a rare blood disorder called POEMS syndrome, which had left him with numb hands and feet, an enlarged heart and failing kidneys. Every few days, doctors needed to drain liters of fluid from his abdomen. He became too sick to receive a stem cell transplant — one of the only treatments that could have put him into remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I gave up,” he said. “I just thought the end was inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Coates’s girlfriend, Tara Theobald, wasn’t ready to quit. So she sent an email begging for help to a doctor in Philadelphia named David Fajgenbaum, whom the couple met a year earlier at a rare disease summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;By the next morning, Dr. Fajgenbaum had replied, suggesting an unconventional combination of chemotherapy, immunotherapy and steroids previously untested as a treatment for Coates’s disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Within a week, Coates was responding to treatment. In four months, he was healthy enough for a stem cell transplant. Today, he’s in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The lifesaving drug regimen wasn’t thought up by the doctor, or any person. It had been spit out by an artificial intelligence model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;Pollen counts likely will exceed historical averages in 39 states this year as warmer weather starts to blanket much of the U.S., meteorologists are warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts are urging those who suffer from seasonal allergies to take heed and prepare for an intense allergy season that could last longer and linger into the fall months.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“About one-quarter of U.S. adults have been diagnosed with seasonal allergies, and nearly one in five children have seasonal allergies,” Alan Reppert, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/allergy-forecast-for-the-us-in-2025/1756039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said in statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Millions of people living with seasonal allergies will be struggling with more intense symptoms that will likely stick around longer this year in many areas,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reppert attributed these complications to the wet and warm weather patterns anticipated later this year, which he projected would lead to these unwelcome spikes in pollen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues also looked to the colder and snowier winter that much of the country experienced, which will now be upended by warmer spring temperatures overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The hotter weather would be consistent with springs in recent years and foster longer growing seasons and earlier starts to allergy season, added Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist and climate expert for AccuWeather.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thanks to changing climate conditions, Anderson said in a statement that seasonal allergy seasons are lasting one to four weeks longer in many parts of the country, in comparison to 50 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“There will be variability year to year depending on spring temperatures, storm tracks, and additional moisture from tropical storms and hurricanes, but the overall trend is clear,” Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tree pollen, the first of three primary allergens in the U.S., begins in the spring once ground temperatures climb to 40-45 degrees Fahrenheit, according to an AccuWeather report. Next in line is a wave of grass pollen in the late spring and early summer, followed by weed pollen in the late summer and fall.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The cold start to the year in much of the eastern half of the country will keep tree pollen levels lower to start, but there can still be a week period of very high levels,” Reppert said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-less-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The meteorologists projected that the worst of the tree pollen would strike the Gulf Coast, the Central Plains, the Northern Rockies and the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tree pollen levels may be higher than the historical averages across a 2,000-mile-long zone, spanning 22 states, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Reppert noted that dry weather in the Southwest through the spring should ultimately help the season end there after a ferocious start.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Northeast and the Pacific Northwest will likely face the most severe grass-related allergy seasons, particularly in June and July amid a probable warm and wet start to summer, according to AccuWeather.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for weed pollen, these allergens are expected to do their worst and peak in July across the Tennessee Valley, but they may also usher in a second peak due to a rise in moisture toward the end of the summer, the report found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the planet continues to warm, Anderson warned that the trend of longer and more intense allergy seasons will likely persist over the next decade. Contributing to this phenomenon is the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the air and creates warmer air — which in turn, can hold more moisture, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The combination of more rainfall that can boost plant growth, higher spring temperatures, longer growing seasons, and more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere triggering increased pollen production is the reason why more people are experiencing seasonal allergy symptoms for the first time, and many longtime allergy suffers are dealing with worsening symptoms,” Anderson added.&lt;/p&gt;

By observing individual neurons in mice, scientists found that learning occurs much faster than previously thought, in as few as 20 to 40 tries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this learning activity takes place in the sensory cortex, a region typically associated with perception rather than cognition. The study also found that even after mastering a task, mice continued to make errors, suggesting they were deliberately testing their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice learned tasks in just 20-40 attempts, much faster than expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Cortex Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Learning occurred in the sensory cortex, not just higher-order brain areas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice continued making mistakes after learning, suggesting strategic exploration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By revealing for the first time what happens in the brain when an animal makes a mistake, Johns Hopkins University researchers are shedding light on the holy grail of neuroscience: the mechanics of how we learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team pinpointed the exact moment mice learned a new skill by observing the activity of individual neurons, confirming earlier work that suggested animals are fast learners that purposely test the boundaries of new knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108193"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/mistakes-learning-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although the ability to learn quickly would benefit any animal in the wild, animals studied in labs seem to learn slowly and methodically. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federally funded work, which upends assumptions about the speed of learning and the role of the sensory cortex, and which the researchers believe will hold true across animal species including humans, is newly published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking at a tiny part of the brain in a mouse, we can understand how the brain learns, and we can makes predictions about how the human brain might work,” said Kishore Kuchibhotla, a Johns Hopkins neuroscientist who studies learning in humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The field of neuroscience has made great progress decoding motor activity and how the brain processes sight and sound. But a holy grail of this type of research is thought—what comes between the hearing and the doing—we’re all still trying to understand the patterns of brain activity that underly higher-order cognitive processes. These findings are a step in that direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the ability to learn quickly would benefit any animal in the wild, animals studied in labs seem to learn slowly and methodically. It typically takes mice, for instance, thousands of tries to learn a task, several hundred at best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kuchibhotla’s lab previously found that animals’ performance doesn’t necessarily sync with their knowledge—or that animals might know a lot more than they demonstrate in tests. The lab also found that animals that seem to be slow learners might be testing their new knowledge. But by merely watching animals struggle at tasks, they couldn’t tell a slow learner from a strategic tester of boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are interested in the idea that humans and other animals may know things about the world, things that they choose not to show,” Kuchibhotla said. “Our core question is what is the neural basis of this distinction between learning and performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers taught mice to lick when they heard one tone but not to lick when they heard a different sound. From the moment training began, the team recorded the activity of neurons in the auditory cortex, an area of the brain associated with hearing and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were two major surprises. First, the mice learned in 20 to 40 tries, “extraordinarily fast,” according to Kuchibhotla. And second, this learning activity happened in the sensory cortex, something that has typically been associated with nonsensory brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work illustrates the importance of assessing how brain activity impacts behavior at different stages of the learning process and in different conditions,” said first author Celine Drieu, a postdoctoral fellow studying neuroscience at Johns Hopkins. “Our results show that a sensory cortex does more than processing sensory inputs; it is also crucial to form associations between sensory cues and reinforced actions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mice continued to make errors, licking at the wrong times long after their neural activity showed they’d learned the task, their brain activity confirmed to the researchers that the mice knew the rules of the game—they were just experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We were able to decode the cognitive driver of an error,” Kuchibhotla said. “We could tell if the animal was making a mistake or just wanted to give the other option a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the mice had mastered the task and ceased their exploratory behavior, this higher-order activity started to diminish, and the sensory cortex was no longer involved in the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think this means that animals are smarter than we think, and that there are distinct brain dynamics related to learning. You might know something, but there’s a parallel process related to how you use it. The brain seems wired to do that well, to allow us to toggle between performance and learning as we get better and better at something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this learning and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#177d6578647279577d7f6239727362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jill Rosen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jill Rosen – Johns Hopkins University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08730-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rapid emergence of latent knowledge in the sensory cortex drives learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Kishore Kuchibhotla et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid emergence of latent knowledge in the sensory cortex drives learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapid learning confers significant advantages on animals in ecological environments. Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This slow learning is thought to be supported by gradual changes to cue representation in the sensory cortex. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable once mice achieve ‘expert’ performance. Instead of enhanced cue representations, two-photon calcium imaging of auditory cortical neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reward-prediction signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors early in training, and faded in expert mice. Silencing at the time of this signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting that it serves an associative role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove slower performance improvements. These ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from sensory representations, indicating higher-order functional segregation within auditory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 13:46:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE1WZGhQSUpSOGdldXVuMGt2RTZIRWM3T0REbGdWRnFOWnFqV1hQeDJXUGExLWRadEZZZXVXUEl2QVM4YTFHX25rZjUtbGFINnUzVmYtNDZZVzZsRVhqanVjMmU1UEMzNFNpUnc</guid></item><item><title>Meet Richard Jakpa, the dishonourably discharged soldier who has become the face of National Security - GhanaWeb</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8AFBVV95cUxPRy1DOGZ4cElOYV8zNXdjdzRJRzhYdEhVU09wQ3dPaWVUTEloNzJ5Zk1HU193WWRMUmpsdnpOYTB1Z29KT0tIXy1iNW5YNFpRVUFmdng3bTV1dmd5aVgyVFA4R1p1LXU3T0g0NW9wSTZXeE41djZtUEd0R2RwS00wQ2xxUzhEX1g4QVEwYl93eVV2LTU4WC1LbENBV0RYU0pma2owR1NBWU9vT0lCMndVVnhIb0t4cU93bjBnVzk5Q3RGSlFmTlNvSjBoZHI5dUhDUHdUdFc0VjhEbV9GVUNWZk1LQkpGUGdaSzhlQTh5UzI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-left"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Richard Anthounma Jakpa, a figure who was dishonourably discharged from the army and has since carried out raids on ex-government officials; raids many have described as illegal, has become a central topic of discussion in the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Before the lead-up to the 2024 Election and his acquittal in the infamous ambulance trial case by the former New Patriotic Party-led government involving Dr &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=2581"&gt;Cassiel Ato Forson&lt;/a&gt;, the current Minister of Finance, Jakpa was relatively unknown in larger political circles. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
While he was recognised by members of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=3181"&gt;National Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; (NDC), his name was still not widely known by the general public.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This changed with the resurfacing of the ambulance trial, which had been ongoing for some time. In July 2024, the Court of Appeal acquitted and discharged both Ato Forson and Jakpa of wrongdoing in the purchase of some ambulances under the first tenure of President &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=1349"&gt;John Dramani Mahama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Following this, Jakpa quickly became a known figure in political and national discussions during the electioneering period. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He publicly declared his support for the NDC and was subsequently appointed by the party as an agent supervisor for the 2024 Election ballot printing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But who is Richard Jakpa, the operative who has emerged as a figure leading raids against former government officials, sparking widespread conversations and controversies?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Richard Jakpa is a businessman, founder, and executive chairman of Las Adventuras Ltd, a civil engineering and building contracting company. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The company began as a general civil works contractor in 2009 and has since expanded its scope to become a main contractor, handling projects of various scales, including industrial and commercial developments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Military record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa was dishonorably discharged from the Ghana Armed Forces due to unsatisfactory conduct and acts of indiscipline. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He was commissioned as a Lieutenant on August 21, 1998, as part of Regular Career Course Intake 38 and was initially posted to the Army Reece Regiment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Between 2000 and 2007, Jakpa made eight unsuccessful attempts to pass the Level A PROMEX, a written promotional exam for military officers seeking advancement. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Officers primarily take this exam with the rank of Flying Officer or Flight Lieutenant, who are eligible for promotion to higher ranks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In addition to his failure in promotional exams, Jakpa's disciplinary record further contributed to his discharge. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Notably, in 2004, he went AWOL (Absent Without Leave), for which he was tried and charged. He was severely reprimanded, with the forfeiture of 14 days' pay.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa, among other misconducts, was sacked for unsatisfactory conduct and inefficiency in the discharge of his duties under Article 15 item 2 (a) of the GAF regulations, where inefficiency under the said regulation meant continuous lack of application and interest, as stated in the rules.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In summary, Jakpa was released from the service in 2007. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Government appointment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa was appointed as the Director of Special Operations at the National Security Secretariat, with his appointment taking effect on January 31, 2025.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this role, Jakpa oversees the planning and execution of covert and overt operations. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
His duties also include developing early warning systems for emerging threats such as terrorism, insurgency, and organised crime.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, he ensures the readiness of special forces and rapid response units, leads crisis response efforts during national security emergencies, and handles other strategic assignments from the National Security Coordinator or Chief Director.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Raids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since assuming office, Richard Jakpa has led raids on two high-ranking former government officials: Ken Ofori-Atta, the former Minister of Finance, and Dr. Ernest Addison, the former Governor of the Bank of Ghana.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These raids have sparked widespread discussions about the legalities and the "Rambo-style" approaches often employed during these operations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He also led a raid that resulted in a bust, seizing a large, unspecified amount of US dollars and Ghanaian cedis, including counterfeit currencies, as well as gold bars hidden in twelve 20-ft shipping containers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The containers, which were tracked to a warehouse at Sapeiman within the Ga South Municipality, were discovered as part of a special operation conducted by National Security, following a tip-off.&lt;br&gt;

Bird flu “is adapting to mammals, and it continues to show new tricks,” Nelson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The virus is spreading widely in domestic and wild animals, while exact transmission routes remain unclear. Confirmed human cases are rising, particularly among farmworkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/2020s.html"&gt;two years into&lt;/a&gt; the US outbreak, we’re stuck with H5N1 for the long haul. The risk that it mutates to spread readily from person to person and that we could find ourselves in the middle of another pandemic is entrenched. As the Trump administration hacks away at scientific institutions and rapid federal changes impede the flow of information, the threat looms especially large. To mitigate those chances, animal agriculture, wildlife management, trade policy, and even cat owners may have to adapt to manage the virus on multiple fronts — indefinitely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;It’s like “watching a train wreck in slow motion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with many virologists and epidemiologists outside the agency, continue to describe the threat that the virus poses to the public as low. Yet the likelihood of an H5N1 human pandemic “is growing,” says Nelson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The vast majority of the 70 confirmed human cases in the US have been mild. But since last November, at least four people have been hospitalized with H5N1 in North America (three in the US and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2415890"&gt;one in Canada&lt;/a&gt;). In January, one person died in Louisiana after contracting the virus from a backyard poultry flock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Until recently, Nelson and other bird flu experts held out hope that, with some basic interventions, the H5N1 outbreak among cows and poultry would burn itself out and that cases among wild animals might fade away, as they did during a &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/media/document/2086/file"&gt;brief 2014-2015 outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. But the latest events prove that isn’t likely. “It’s hard to imagine a scenario where it’s no longer a pandemic threat,” Nelson says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Since the virus was first detected in cows in March 2024, almost 1,000 dairy herds have been infected. Despite that spread, scientists saw a silver lining: for nearly the whole year, all of those cases were infections of a viral genotype called B3.13, believed to have entered the cattle population from a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.01.591751v1"&gt;single spillover event in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, wherein a cow caught the virus from a wild bird. “We thought this was a one-off: one bird to one cow, and we wouldn’t see that again,” says &lt;a href="https://ghi.wisc.edu/directory/peter-halfmann/"&gt;Peter Halfmann&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Influenza Research Institute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Yet the more severe human cases are concurrent with the spread of a recently mutated, potentially more dangerous version of the virus called the D1.1 genotype. D1.1. is now circulating among wild birds and poultry, and it has &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/aphis-confirms-d11-genotype-dairy-cattle-nevada-0"&gt;spilled over&lt;/a&gt; into dairy cows &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/aphis-confirms-d11-genotype-dairy-cattle-nevada-0"&gt;at least twice&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, according milk testing data from the Agriculture Department. With D1.1, Halfmann explains that the threshold for cross-species transfer is “much lower than we previously thought.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;“There is absolutely no chance of containment, and we now have to think about mitigation and monitoring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Bird flu infections have also been confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;among rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/usda-reports-more-h5n1-detections-mice-and-cats"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt; near farms. Many other wild mammals, including fox, deer, and skunks are &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals"&gt;testing positive&lt;/a&gt; for the virus, but rodents are a particular concern given their notorious propensity to infest human dwellings and act as vectors of disease, says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3059/meghan-frost-davis"&gt;Meghan Davis&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and veterinarian at Johns Hopkins University. “When you have one of these classic reservoir hosts with highly pathogenic avian influenza, it gives you pause,” she says. “If this host could set up to be a reservoir, what implications would that have for our control strategies?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;It’s not yet known if mice or rats transmit the virus onward or are simply dead ends. However, research into 2023 H5N1 outbreaks &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/4/23-1725_article"&gt;among marine mammals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/ferret-study-results.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2023-2024/ferret-study-results.htm"&gt;lab experiments in ferrets&lt;/a&gt; suggest that H5N1 can spread from mammal to mammal in certain cases. And at least &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/13/9/764"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt; of rats found the virus replicates in their respiratory tract, priming the rodents to shed it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The good news is that there’s still been no confirmed instances of human-to-human transmission, and no human case clusters without clear ties to farmwork. These two things would signal a significant uptick in pandemic risk, Nelson says, and there’s no guarantee either will occur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The bad news is that there’s ample opportunity for H5N1 to make that leap, says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/microbiology-immunology/research/labs/lakdawala/index.html"&gt;Seema Lakdawala&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist studying avian influenza at Emory University. According to her, with multiple species acting as wild reservoirs, eradication is effectively impossible. “I think it’s endemic,” she says. And a December 2024 study, published in &lt;em&gt;Science, &lt;/em&gt;concluded that just &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180"&gt;a single mutation&lt;/a&gt; could make the currently circulating H5N1 virus readily transmissible between humans. “What we’re allowing this virus to do is like 1,000 shots on goal,” Lakdawala says&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;H5N1 has been around for decades. The virus first evolved in waterfowl like ducks and geese, but it has long been transmissible among many other types of birds including seabirds and songbirds. It was initially isolated following an outbreak in Scottish chickens &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1880-1959.html"&gt;in 1959&lt;/a&gt;. The first human infections and deaths occurred during a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1960-1999.html"&gt;1997 outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Hong Kong. In the years since, public health authorities have contained periodic outbreaks as they’ve happened, and the worst case hasn’t materialized yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;“If you look at the last 80 years, we’ve never seen anything like this with H5.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Now, though, “we’re in a whole new ballgame,” says &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph"&gt;Michael T. Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. “If you look at the last 80 years, we’ve never seen anything like this with H5.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/inside-mdhhs/executive-staff-bios/dr-natasha-bagdasarian"&gt;Natasha Bagdasarian&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and the chief medical executive in Michigan, has been at the forefront of the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/12/h5n1-bird-flu-michigan-testing-more-animals-humans-than-other-states/"&gt;much-lauded multipronged response&lt;/a&gt; to the H5N1 outbreak. Last spring, she was hopeful that the spread could be stamped out through thoughtful communication with farmworkers and disease-monitoring strategies in just a handful of states. Less than a year on, despite the fact that new cases in Michigan dairies have stalled, that optimism is gone. “At this point, I would say there is absolutely no chance of containment, and we now have to think about mitigation and monitoring.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;With a virus like rabies, wildlife managers will sometimes disperse an oral vaccine through food to control local outbreaks among animals. With H5N1, &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1972/andrew-stanley-pekosz"&gt;Andrew Pekosz&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University, says that’s not a viable option. It’s in too many different species across too large of an area. Even if we had some readily dispersible bait that all of these animals were attracted to, there is no oral H5N1 vaccine to use. In lieu of that far-fetched hypothetical, Pekosz says mitigation means doubling down on reducing risk at the interfaces between wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Backyard poultry and pets — especially cats — are vulnerable to the virus and worrying potential transmission sources to the public, says Davis. Health officials have confirmed dozens of infections in domestic cats, most recently in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/nyregion/pet-cats-bird-flu-new-york-city.html"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;In February, the CDC published, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/06/health/cdc-bird-flu-cats-people.html"&gt;deleted&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7405a2.htm"&gt;rereleased an unsettling report&lt;/a&gt; describing two instances where indoor cats in the households of dairy workers fell ill with bird flu. Out of five cats, three got sick and two died. Some people in the households, including those who had no direct exposure to farm animals or raw milk, also showed symptoms of illness. Despite layers of safety precautions, H5N1 found its way in and potentially spread from cow to human, human to cat, clothes to cat, cat to cat, or cat to human. The web of possible transmissions and infections remains unclear and unconfirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Davis advocates for pets to be &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/04/h5n1-avian-flu-cats-transmission-pets-companion-animals-disease-surveillance/"&gt;included in viral surveillance&lt;/a&gt; efforts. In the interim, &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/health/how-to-protect-your-pets-from-bird-flu/"&gt;pet owners&lt;/a&gt; should keep track of H5N1 reports in their area, be sure to always supervise pets outside, and avoid feeding animals raw milk or meat products. Those with backyard chickens or other fowl should implement hygiene measures, in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-pets/about/backyard-poultry.html"&gt;accordance with federal&lt;/a&gt; and local guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Yet, for now, the biggest locus of prevention over the long term remains farms. Michigan and other states, like California — where the virus has hit about &lt;a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/AHFSS/Animal_Health/HPAI.html"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of dairies — should commit to increased and constant surveillance on farms, coupled with immediate interventions upon detection, Lakdawala says, adding, “But I think it’s going to be really hard. I don’t know if the farmers are ready for something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;“It’s going to be really hard. I don’t know if the farmers are ready for something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;The USDA began &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2024/12/06/usda-announces-new-federal-order-begins-national-milk-testing-strategy-address-h5n1-dairy-herds"&gt;requiring states&lt;/a&gt; to submit samples of raw milk for H5N1 testing last December, but that doesn’t identify individual infected cows or stop the virus from spreading among an entire herd or farm. To reduce overall human exposure to H5N1, and minimize the chances the virus makes a significant jump from cows to humans or spills back into wildlife, we need to be testing individual cows on affected farms, Lakdawala says. Such a regimen would also help scientists better understand the virus, offering a window into the number of sick cows and how the flu is spreading. The current prevailing belief is that most transmission between cows occurs via contaminated milking equipment, yet it’s important to monitor for evidence of other forms of spread, she explains, because that would mean a significant change in the virus and a rise in risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Biosecurity efforts on farms should also be ramped up and sustained, Pekosz says. The types of flock containment measures that have been deployed for poultry need to be strengthened and translated to dairy cattle, he explains. “For most of the poultry industry, there is no such thing as free-range chickens.” On many farms, birds are held in closed facilities, and all people and equipment entering undergo a disinfection process: changing clothes and sanitizing boots. “A cow isn’t a bird, but the same principles can be applied,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Many states have already advised or mandated farms to institute new biosecurity protocols, including sanitizing vehicles and equipment, preventing contact between wildlife and farmed animals, restricting animal transport, and recommending protective equipment like masks and face shields to workers. Yet major challenges remain, says Tim Boring, director of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. “The prospect of completely segregating out wildlife from dairy farms would certainly be a daunting task,” he says, adding that it would also be an expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;More wildlife testing could help farms defray costs by catching new viral mutations and trends of local spread even earlier, Pekosz says. With sufficient wildlife monitoring, farmers could hold off on the most intensive defense strategies unless and until nearby wild animals test positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Though a wildlife vaccination campaign isn’t feasible, the USDA &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; investigating the use of avian flu vaccines in &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices"&gt;poultry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/usda-builds-actions-protect-livestock-public-health-h5n1-avian-influenza"&gt;cows&lt;/a&gt;. Despite some countries already vaccinating poultry, the US has so far avoided the practice as many trade partners ban imports of vaccinated birds. Moving forward, global trade agreements will likely &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/en/avian-influenza-vaccination-why-it-should-not-be-a-barrier-to-safe-trade/"&gt;require renegotiation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;It’s a good sign that the US is seriously considering vaccines, Halfmann says, but he warns that any vaccination effort will require sustained investment to be effective. “We can’t have one season where we vaccinate and then stop. This is a long-term endeavor that we’re going to have to go through that’s going to cost money and require buy-in from farmers. It’s a lot of hurdles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _1o279nj2 _1o279nj0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote qnnwq0"&gt;&lt;p class="qnnwq1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup qnnwq2 _1xwtict9"&gt;“It’s hard to imagine a scenario where it’s no longer a pandemic threat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;An animal vaccine would need to be regularly assessed and updated to keep pace with viral mutations, just like the seasonal human flu has historically been, he explains. Given that the Food and Drug Administration is now helmed by &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)02603-5/fulltext"&gt;prominent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00709-9"&gt;anti-vaxxer&lt;/a&gt; Robert F.

While the virus is evolving quickly, so are US regulatory agencies. Lakdawala says there are fewer updates on federal efforts around H5N1. Until recently, Davis participated in regular small group briefings with the CDC, where governmental and nongovernmental experts would share data and insights on the virus. Now, she says those meetings have completely stopped. “What’s been most concerning to me is the lack of communication,” she says. “The backbone of outbreak response is communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;Without up-to-date information, virologists, epidemiologists, and state public health officials are left in the dark, with little to guide their science or policy. At the same time, research institutions are facing real and threatened major budget cuts and are enacting extensive layoffs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1ymtmqpi _17nnmdy1 _17nnmdy0 _1xwtict1"&gt;“We are flirting with a massive global pandemic that could be equal to or greater than COVID-19,” Nelson says; yet, all the knowledge and tools we built during the pandemic aren’t being harnessed.

										&lt;p&gt;Sonora, CA — What was originally reported as being two suspected measles cases in Tuolumne County, is now two confirmed positive cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tuolumne County Public Health Department reports that it is an adult and a child from the same household who had recently traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Health is actively working to identify and contact those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We understand that there may be a lot of questions and concerns,” says Tuolumne County Public Health Director Michelle Jachetta. “The investigation is still ongoing, and we will provide updates as they are available. We want to remind the public that measles is a highly contagious disease and to take steps to protect yourself and your family by ensuring current vaccination status for measles, monitoring for symptoms, and staying home when you feel sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Public Health Department reports that the vaccination status of the two positive cases is unconfirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the two cases in Tuolumne County, there had only been five confirmed cases of measles in California this year. &lt;a href="https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/local/3659548/suspected-measles-cases-involving-summerville-high-and-ahs.html"&gt;We reported earlier&lt;/a&gt; that public health was investigating possible exposure at Summerville High and Adventist Health Sonora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details on measles from the California Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/Communications-Toolkits/Measles.aspx"&gt;can be found here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Richard Jakpa, a figure who was dishonourably discharged from the army and has since carried out raids on ex-government officials; raids many have described as illegal, has become a central topic of discussion in the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the lead-up to the 2024 Election and his acquittal in the infamous ambulance trial case by the former New Patriotic Party-led government involving Dr &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=2581"&gt;Cassiel Ato Forson&lt;/a&gt;, the current Minister of Finance, Jakpa was relatively unknown in larger political circles. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
While he was recognised by members of the &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=3181"&gt;National Democratic Congress&lt;/a&gt; (NDC), his name was still not widely known by the general public.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This changed with the resurfacing of the ambulance trial, which had been ongoing for some time. In July 2024, the Court of Appeal acquitted and discharged both Ato Forson and Jakpa of wrongdoing in the purchase of some ambulances under the first tenure of President &lt;a target="_blank" href="/GhanaHomePage/people/person.php?ID=1349"&gt;John Dramani Mahama&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Following this, Jakpa quickly became a known figure in political and national discussions during the electioneering period. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He publicly declared his support for the NDC and was subsequently appointed by the party as an agent supervisor for the 2024 Election ballot printing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But who is Richard Jakpa, the operative who has emerged as a figure leading raids against former government officials, sparking widespread conversations and controversies?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Richard Jakpa is a businessman, founder, and executive chairman of Las Adventuras Ltd, a civil engineering and building contracting company. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The company began as a general civil works contractor in 2009 and has since expanded its scope to become a main contractor, handling projects of various scales, including industrial and commercial developments.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Military record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa was dishonorably discharged from the Ghana Armed Forces due to unsatisfactory conduct and acts of indiscipline. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He was commissioned as a Lieutenant on August 21, 1998, as part of Regular Career Course Intake 38 and was initially posted to the Army Reece Regiment.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Between 2000 and 2007, Jakpa made eight unsuccessful attempts to pass the Level A PROMEX, a written promotional exam for military officers seeking advancement. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Officers primarily take this exam with the rank of Flying Officer or Flight Lieutenant, who are eligible for promotion to higher ranks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In addition to his failure in promotional exams, Jakpa's disciplinary record further contributed to his discharge. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Notably, in 2004, he went AWOL (Absent Without Leave), for which he was tried and charged. He was severely reprimanded, with the forfeiture of 14 days' pay.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa, among other misconducts, was sacked for unsatisfactory conduct and inefficiency in the discharge of his duties under Article 15 item 2 (a) of the GAF regulations, where inefficiency under the said regulation meant continuous lack of application and interest, as stated in the rules.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In summary, Jakpa was released from the service in 2007. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Government appointment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jakpa was appointed as the Director of Special Operations at the National Security Secretariat, with his appointment taking effect on January 31, 2025.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In this role, Jakpa oversees the planning and execution of covert and overt operations. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
His duties also include developing early warning systems for emerging threats such as terrorism, insurgency, and organised crime.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Additionally, he ensures the readiness of special forces and rapid response units, leads crisis response efforts during national security emergencies, and handles other strategic assignments from the National Security Coordinator or Chief Director.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Raids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Since assuming office, Richard Jakpa has led raids on two high-ranking former government officials: Ken Ofori-Atta, the former Minister of Finance, and Dr. Ernest Addison, the former Governor of the Bank of Ghana.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
These raids have sparked widespread discussions about the legalities and the "Rambo-style" approaches often employed during these operations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He also led a raid that resulted in a bust, seizing a large, unspecified amount of US dollars and Ghanaian cedis, including counterfeit currencies, as well as gold bars hidden in twelve 20-ft shipping containers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The containers, which were tracked to a warehouse at Sapeiman within the Ga South Municipality, were discovered as part of a special operation conducted by National Security, following a tip-off.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of a cure for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="154970" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is becoming an increasingly competitive and contentious quest with recent years witnessing several important controversies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; reported that a key &lt;a href="https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature04533"&gt;2006 research paper, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which identified a subtype of brain protein called beta-amyloid as the cause of Alzheimer's, may have been based on fabricated data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year earlier, in June 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/aducanumab-marketed-aduhelm-information"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration had approved aducanumab&lt;/a&gt;, an antibody-targeting beta-amyloid, as a treatment for Alzheimer's, even though the data supporting its use were incomplete and contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some physicians believe aducanumab never should have been approved, while others maintain it should be given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With millions of people needing an effective treatment, why are researchers still fumbling in this quest for a cure for what is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg" alt="Clumps of yellow forming among purple neurons" class="size-medium wp-image-142437" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of beta-amyloid plaques (yellow) amongst neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3tpYQR4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Escaping the beta-amyloid rut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have been focused on trying to come up with new treatments for Alzheimer's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.192"&gt;by preventing the formation of brain-damaging clumps of this mysterious protein&lt;/a&gt; called beta-amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, we scientists have arguably got ourselves into a bit of an intellectual rut concentrating almost exclusively on this approach, often neglecting or even ignoring other possible explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, this dedication to studying the abnormal protein clumps has not translated into a useful drug or therapy. The need for a new "out-of-the-clump" way of thinking about Alzheimer's is emerging as a top priority in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My laboratory at the Krembil Brain Institute, part of the University Health Network in Toronto, is devising a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12283"&gt;new theory of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our past 30 years of research, we no longer think of Alzheimer's as primarily a disease of the brain. Rather, we believe that Alzheimer's is principally &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1567205018666211202141650"&gt;a disorder of the immune system within the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immune system, found in every organ in the body, is a collection of cells and molecules that work in harmony to help repair injuries and protect from foreign invaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person trips and falls, the immune system helps to mend the damaged tissues. When someone experiences a viral or bacterial infection, the immune system helps in the fight against these microbial invaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact same processes are present in the brain. When there is head trauma, the brain's immune system kicks into gear to help repair. When bacteria are present in the brain, the immune system is there to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg" alt="Bright green cells with orange spots in between them" class="size-full wp-image-144645" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White blood cells of the immune system activated to fight a bacterial infection. Green shows expression of molecules in their surfaces, and orange shows synthesis of molecules inside the cells. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC8pLP43hw/"&gt;Dlumen/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Alzheimer's as autoimmune disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that beta-amyloid is not an abnormally produced protein, but rather is a normally occurring molecule that is part of the brain's immune system. It is supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When brain trauma occurs or when bacteria are present in the brain, beta-amyloid is a key contributor to the brain's comprehensive immune response. And this is where the problem begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of striking similarities between the fat molecules that make up both the membranes of bacteria and the membranes of brain cells, beta-amyloid cannot tell the difference between invading bacteria and host brain cells, and mistakenly attacks the very brain cells it is supposed to be protecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads to a chronic, progressive loss of brain cell function, which ultimately culminates in dementia – all because our body's immune system cannot differentiate between bacteria and brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When regarded as a misdirected attack by the brain's immune system on the very organ it is supposed to be defending, Alzheimer's disease emerges as an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of the disease, and for which steroid-based therapies can be effective. But these therapies will not work against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is a very special and distinctive organ, recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234155/#"&gt;the most complex structure in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg" alt="A senior man and woman looking at a book together" class="size-full wp-image-144646" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD5TsR1koQ/"&gt;Robert Kneschke/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our model of Alzheimer's, beta-amyloid helps to protect and bolster our immune system, but unfortunately, it also plays a central role in the autoimmune process that, we believe, may lead to the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though drugs conventionally used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases may not work against Alzheimer's, we strongly believe that targeting other immune-regulating pathways in the brain will lead us to new and effective treatment approaches for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other theories of the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this autoimmune theory of Alzheimer's, many other new and varied theories are beginning to appear. For example, some scientists believe that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2022.05.001"&gt;Alzheimer's is a disease of tiny cellular structures called mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; – the energy factories in every brain cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria convert oxygen from the air we breathe and glucose from the food we eat into the energy required for remembering and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that it is the end-result of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.339476"&gt;particular brain infection&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12429"&gt;bacteria from the mouth often being suggested as the culprit&lt;/a&gt;. Still others suggest that the disease may arise from an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12050714"&gt;abnormal handling of metals within the brain&lt;/a&gt;, possibly zinc, copper, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying to see &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327370"&gt;new thinking about this age-old disease&lt;/a&gt;. Dementia currently affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with a new diagnosis being made every three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children or even their spouse of more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a public health crisis in need of innovative ideas and fresh directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg" alt="A young person kissing an older lady on the cheek" class="size-full wp-image-144650" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children.

However, it has now reached wild and domestic game animal herds in &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/distribution-chronic-wasting-disease-north-america-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;36 US states&lt;/a&gt; as well as parts of Canada, wild and domestic reindeer in Scandinavia and farmed deer and elk in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the media, CWD is often called “zombie deer disease” due to its symptoms, which include drooling, emaciation, disorientation, a vacant “staring” gaze and a lack of fear of people. As concerns about spillover to humans or other species grow, however, the moniker has irritated many scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It trivialises what we’re facing,” says epidemiologist Michael Osterholm. “It leaves readers with the false impression that this is nothing more than some strange fictional menace you’d find in the plot of a sci-fi film. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/animals" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Animals&lt;/a&gt; that get infected with CWD do not come back from the dead. CWD is a deathly serious public and wildlife health issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Five years ago, Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, delivered what he hoped would be a wake-up call before the Minnesota legislature, warning about “spillover” of CWD transmission from infected deer to humans eating game meat. Back then, some portrayed him as a scaremonger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/03/cwd_map/giv-4559yca2z3hh6VZg/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"A map of the US showing which counties in each state have been affected by CWD","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":0},"elementId":"9ad81af3-b2b0-4878-8a2c-706f3b0621c5","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="9ad81af3-b2b0-4878-8a2c-706f3b0621c5" data-alt="A map of the US showing which counties in each state have been affected by CWD" data-testid="interactive-element-A%20map%20of%20the%20US%20showing%20which%20counties%20in%20each%20state%20have%20been%20affected%20by%20CWD" data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/03/cwd_map/giv-4559yca2z3hh6VZg/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;A map of the US showing which counties in each state have been affected by CWD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Today, as CWD spreads inexorably to more deer and elk, more people – probably tens of thousands each year – are consuming infected venison, and a growing number of scientists are echoing Osterholm’s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In January 2025, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/CWD%20Report%202025_0.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt;, Chronic Wasting Disease Spillover Preparedness and Response: Charting an Uncertain Future. A panel of 67 experts who study zoonotic diseases that can move back and forth between humans and animals concluded that spillover to humans “would trigger a national and global crisis” with “far-reaching effects on the food supply, economy, global trade and agriculture”, as well as potentially devastating effects on human health. The report concludes that the US is utterly unprepared to deal with spillover of CWD to people, and that there is no unifying international strategy to prevent CWD’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Wyoming has wilfully chosen to ignore conservationists, scientists, disease experts and prominent wildlife managers who were all saying the same thing: stop the feeding&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Lloyd Dorsey, conservationist&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;So far, there has not been a documented case of a human contracting CWD, but as with BSE (or mad cow disease) and its variant strain that killed people, long incubation times can mask the presence of disease. CWD, which is incurable, can be diagnosed only after a victim dies. Better surveillance to identify disease in people and game animals is more urgent than ever, experts say. Osterholm says the Trump administration’s proposed cuts to public health funding and research, and the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/cdc-world-health-organization-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; from international institutions, such as the World Health Organization, could not be happening at a worse time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he risk of a CWD spillover event is growing, the panel of experts say, and the risk is higher in states where big game hunting for the table remains a tradition. In a survey of US residents by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronic-wasting/about/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;20% said&lt;/a&gt; they had hunted deer or elk, and more than 60% said they had eaten venison or elk meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Tens of thousands of people are probably eating contaminated game meat either because they do not think they are at risk or they are unaware of the threat. “Hunters sharing their venison with other families is a widespread practice,” Osterholm says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people who suspect they have killed an animal infected with CWD not to eat it, and states advise any hunters taking animals from infected regions to get them tested. Many, however, do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="19e53cfd-21d2-4ffa-94ac-31d3b7e830d3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A biologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources removes lymph nodes from deer in a hunter’s truck, to test for CWD.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Scott Takushi/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The movement of meat around the country also raises concerns of environmental contamination. CWD is not caused by bacteria or a virus, but by “prions”: abnormal, transmissible pathogenic agents that are difficult to destroy. Prions have demonstrated an ability to remain activated in soils for many years, infecting animals that come in contact with contaminated areas where they have been shed via urination, defecation, saliva and decomposition when an animal dies. &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Graph-showing-the-home-ZIP-codes-of-hunters-who-harvested-deer-n-32-000-2016-2017-in_fig6_35972636" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the US Geological Survey has shown that numerous carcasses of hunted animals, many probably contaminated with CWD, are transported across state lines, accelerating the scope of prion dispersal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In states where many thousands of deer and elk carcasses are disposed of, some in landfill, there is concern among epidemiologists and local public health officials that toxic waste sites for prions could be created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Every autumn, Lloyd Dorsey has hunted elk and deer to put meat on the table, but now he is concerned about its safety. “Since CWD is now in elk and deer throughout Greater Yellowstone, the disease is on everybody’s mind,” he says. Dorsey has spent decades as a professional conservationist for the Sierra Club, based in Jackson Hole in Wyoming, and he has pressed the state and federal governments to shut down feedgrounds for deer – where cervids gather and disease can easily spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="696f0a7c-0650-475d-8b6d-700a5cb5af29" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A sign in Montana warns of CWD in an attempt to prevent its spread via animal carcasses.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Montana Wildlife Federation&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Wyoming has wilfully chosen to ignore conservationists, scientists, disease experts and prominent wildlife managers who were all saying the same thing: stop the feeding,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;What’s happening was predictable and we’re living with the consequences of some decisions that were rooted in denial&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Tom Roffe, former US Fish and Wildlife Service chief&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Apart from the grave concerns about CWD reaching people, scientists describe it as “an existential threat” to wild cervid populations, which are central to American hunting traditions.

Wyoming has attracted national criticism for refusing to shutter nearly two dozen feedgrounds where tens of thousands of elk and deer gather in close confines every winter and are fed artificial forage to bolster their numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the largest feedgrounds is operated by the federal government: the &lt;a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/national-elk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;National Elk Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, where more than 8,000 elk cluster, and CWD has already been detected. Tom Roffe, former chief of animal health for the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge, and Bruce Smith, a former refuge senior biologist, have said Wyoming has created ripe conditions for an outbreak of the disease, with consequences that will negatively ripple throughout the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This has been a slowly expanding epidemic with a growth curve playing out on a decades scale, but now we’re seeing the deepening consequences and they could be severe,” Roffe says. “Unfortunately, what’s happening with this disease was predictable and we’re living with the consequences of some decisions that were rooted in denial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Roffe and others say the best defence is having healthy landscapes where unnatural feeding of wildlife is unnecessary and where predators are not eliminated but allowed to carry out their role of eliminating sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“As Yellowstone has been for generations, it is the most amazing and best place to get wildlife conservation right,” Dorsey says. “It would be such a shame if we continued doing something as foolish as concentrating thousands of elk and deer, making them more vulnerable to catching and spreading this catastrophic disease, when we didn’t have to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find more &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;age of extinction coverage here&lt;/a&gt;, and follow the biodiversity reporters &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/phoebe-weston" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Phoebe Weston&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrick-greenfield" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Patrick Greenfield&lt;/a&gt; in the Guardian app for more nature coverage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 11:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNd1dFUmpsZ3FrYVZLWjFhbHpaWjZScnNfTVFURzlqWXJpdE01ek9rajFGc1ljRDE3cWhYWU5PYVppZjZMRlVwRjkyVjZvNlBkeUg5UmdVX2UtVm44T3lHZDNIQ3R1aHhyMW85UjYtTXJvXzJUNWpHX1Q4bTBDcDdUX0lXUnotbHBGeG9wREkxdndwemFEcUNhQU82SktSVDFRbkd5aTdMOEZibDJH</guid></item><item><title>What is babesiosis?

            The ongoing measles outbreak has reached three states and serves as a stark reminder of the vital role that herd immunity plays in safeguarding our communities. Originating in Gaines County, Texas, the outbreak has now resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/health/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-oklahoma/index.html"&gt;321 reported cases&lt;/a&gt;, with 38 hospitalizations and two deaths, including a school-age child who was unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000d3b6m2r4mqpmf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The initial epicenter within a Texas Mennonite community highlights how declining vaccination rates can lead to rapid disease transmission. While some may believe that abstaining from vaccination keeps them healthier or more resistant to diseases, the reality is that their “immunity” has, until now, been borrowed from their vaccinated neighbors. This collective shield, known as herd immunity, is not automatic or enduring; it has been built over decades through high vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000e3b6m84mkbckp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, this protection is now eroding due to rising vaccine skepticism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000f3b6m7xdjhvk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Herd immunity works by ensuring that a high enough portion of the population is vaccinated so that highly contagious diseases like measles can’t find a vulnerable “host” to spread to. This strategy protects those who cannot receive vaccines for medical reasons — and even those who refuse them for personal beliefs. However, as vaccine skepticism grows, many who have unwittingly benefited from herd immunity in the past are now at greater risk — ironically, from themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000g3b6m7ckq94ex@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A significant driver of current skepticism has been Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the nonprofit organization he led, Children’s Health Defense, which has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"&gt;spread vaccine mistrust&lt;/a&gt; and misinformation for years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000h3b6mn4rvs339@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ironically — or perhaps inevitably — now that Kennedy is secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, he faces the largest measles outbreak in Texas and the first child death from measles in over 20 years. Recently, at President Donald Trump’s first Cabinet meeting, Kennedy acknowledged the death but seemed to dismiss the outbreak as “&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/experts-question-rfk-jr-calling-measles-outbreak-unusual/story?id=119221816" target="_blank"&gt;not unusual&lt;/a&gt;,” drawing widespread criticism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000i3b6mmqnampvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, as the outbreak spirals, he has reversed course, declaring measles a top HHS priority. In a subsequent &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us?msockid=1cc8c496e34a66392813d1bbe22b6787" target="_blank"&gt;Fox News op-ed&lt;/a&gt;,  Kennedy wrote, “Measles outbreak is a call to action for all of us,” emphasizing how vaccinations contribute to community immunity. This marked a dramatic shift from his past rhetoric, as he is now being forced to confront the consequences of the very skepticism he helped foster.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000j3b6mqy4acxq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This moment is critical for both Kennedy and the nation. As I have &lt;a href="https://x.com/jeromeadamsmd/status/1896650973399126170?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; stated, his tenure will not be defined by his work on nutrition or chronic disease (no matter how commendable) but by how he responds to an inexorably increasing number of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000k3b6m2d76lnnb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As Kennedy himself has acknowledged, the resurgence of measles “must serve as a wake-up call.” The disease was declared eliminated in the US&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in 2000, thanks to decades of high vaccination rates. But since then, growing vaccine hesitancy, driven in part by disinformation campaigns, has led to declining immunization rates and renewed outbreaks. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that in some communities, childhood vaccination rates have dropped below the 95% threshold needed to maintain herd immunity. The result? Vulnerable populations — including infants, immunocompromised individuals and those who opt out of vaccines — are now at greater risk than ever before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000l3b6mdcwtfqz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The tragic death of a child should in and of itself be enough to remind us of the serious implications of measles outbreaks. Although it’s true, as Kennedy points out, that most individuals who contract measles will not die from it, we also cannot overlook the alarming reality that 1 in 10 confirmed cases during this outbreak has required hospitalization. This statistic underscores the fact that even non-fatal cases can lead to severe health complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, pregnancy-related issues and potential lifelong health challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000m3b6mc6sa4tvw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, what makes measles particularly dangerous is its extreme contagiousness; many experts describe it as the most contagious virus known. It spreads through airborne particles and can linger in the air for hours. In an unvaccinated community, one infected person can spread measles to up to 90% of those around them. This is why even small declines in vaccination rates can lead to major outbreaks, with hospitalizations and deaths to follow. The Texas situation is proof that when herd immunity erodes, it’s not a matter of if, but when, these outbreaks will follow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000n3b6mzgftomjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The challenge for Kennedy is not just responding to this particular outbreak but reversing the tide of vaccine skepticism that has grown, in part, because of his own past activism. A true leader must be willing to acknowledge mistakes — even if unintended — and correct course. If he is serious about tackling measles, Kennedy must take concrete steps&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to promote vaccine uptake, even in areas and times when there isn’t an active outbreak. Such measures include&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;launching aggressive public education campaigns, ensuring vaccine access, and working with state and local officials to restore trust in immunization programs. And like his predecessors, he must consistently and unequivocally state his commitment to vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gctypc000o3b6mupd5abld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, both Kennedy and much of unvaccinated America are receiving a crash course on the topic of herd immunity. The ability of a minority to remain unvaccinated has always depended on the decisions of a vast majority to protect them. Now, as we confront more outbreaks, one lesson is clear: Community immunity is not just a personal choice, it is a collective responsibility. Kennedy’s legacy will be defined not by what he has said in the past but by what he does now. He will be remembered either as the vaccine skeptic who turned vaccine champion or as the man at the helm of HHS when America made measles great again. For the sake of our public health, and our children, we should all hope it’s the former, not the latter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists evenly split the participants into two groups. One was a pecan snacking group, who were asked to eat two ounces (57 grams) of pecans per day in place of snacks typically consumed, and the usual diet group, who were asked to carry on with their regular diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diet quality, as measured by adherence to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, was 17% higher at the end of the study for participants who ate pecans rather than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pecans contain polyphenols, an anti-inflammatory compound. The research team referenced previous research that suggests polyphenols support a key factor in healthy blood vessels called endothelial function. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, the study did not find differences in vascular health — our bodies' circulatory system of blood vessels — between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Replacing typical snacks with pecans improved key risk factors for heart disease including blood cholesterol levels and diet quality,” said Kristina Petersen, associate professor of nutritional sciences at Penn State and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These results add to the large evidence-base supporting the cardiovascular benefits of nuts and add additional insights into how adults can incorporate nuts into their diet to improve the overall quality of their diet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The professor added: "The improved diet quality among pecan snackers — including a higher percentage of calories from polyunsaturated fats and increased fiber and polyphenols — likely also contributed to the observed cholesterol improvements, particularly the LDL-lowering effects".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Pecan Council funded this study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2025 10:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQQlFOYlpabTZMMDhRczZBMDFJS2w1eDBIVnlBVkhTMTNaSGowQ0JMMTlKaXRxaWtQUVdJQS1sdzVObzNDOFdPQXhXRjVtc0RxdGJ6R0RyT3BNX0toaWxFYkNkWjMyVWFPMC1pZTJndlhHRHZ0OEFwc28yWnFQak5QbHR6RjRBMmdKRlRFT1BmSVhCY19zRllpNg</guid></item><item><title>Doctors raise alarm about rise in “sloth fever” infections linked to birth defects - Salon</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxPLTU5Ym5sWHhsRDNZQ1lUZ3ItSk1iNmRENk42Umo5UlAyOW4wYWZHOGJoRFhjOHM3LXNteVAwUXd5TGpNVlhXemFldjVyYURwOGdnRU1XY2Q4VWtZS2ZyaEl1SFFscVB0S253SE1JWWpkb0ZZc3ZVR3hhNVBrRkl1eWdSaFMwUmNfVGZMUUNUR1hFNjNGX2YzVk0yLVBfWlpKT1hIOW5CdW9MY3RHQ0ZIOEhKVG4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;A surge of infections from a tropical virus is raising alarm among public health officials because it appears to be causing birth defects similar to those associated with &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/10/17/to-study-zika-they-offered-their-kids-then-they-were-forgotten_partner/"&gt;Zika virus&lt;/a&gt;. Known as Oropouche virus, it can trigger a fever that may cause pregnant people to miscarry or their babies to have birth defects known as microcephaly, or smaller than usual heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease caused by this virus currently has no treatment or vaccine, although most cases are generally asymptomatic or mild and resolve on their own. Epidemics of Oropouche fever have occurred multiple times in the past, with approximately &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5417190/"&gt;380,000 infections&lt;/a&gt; between 1961 and 2007. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/2025-feb-10-epi-update-oropoucheeng-final_0.pdf"&gt;more than 16,000 cases were reported&lt;/a&gt;, including four deaths, with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00619-4/fulltext"&gt;8,600 cases in Brazil&lt;/a&gt; alone, many in places where the virus hadn’t been reported before. Over 100 of these cases traveled to the U.S, but there has been no local infections or transmission. All of this indicates that the virus is becoming more prevalent, posing greater risks to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Case numbers have been steadily increasing this year. In areas with previous Oropouche transmission the number of cases have approximately doubled compared to last year and there have been many reports of cases in new areas,” Dr. Stephen Vaughan, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Calgary, told Salon by email. “Due to the nonspecific presentation and limitations in testing for this virus in most countries, the number of reported cases are an underestimate of the true burden of disease.”&lt;a href="http://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/2025-feb-10-epi-update-oropoucheeng-final_0.pdf"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaughan co-authored a recent guide published in the &lt;a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/197/9/E244"&gt;Canadian Medical Association Journal&lt;/a&gt; warning travelers, especially pregnant people, to take precautions and avoid insect bites that can spread the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since late 2023, new outbreaks have been reported in Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Cuba, including among travelers returning to Canada and the United States,” the report states. Notably, more Canadians are ditching vacation plans in the U.S. and traveling to South America instead, according to a recent &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/canadians-boycott-us-travel-south-america-trump-tariff-trade-war-2025-3"&gt;Business Insider report&lt;/a&gt;, in response to &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/04/consumers-are-likely-to-pay-higher-prices-tariffs-begin-on-mexico-canada/"&gt;tariffs imposed by the U.S. government&lt;/a&gt;. But Oropouche can be hard to detect, and is easily confused with other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As this is a recent outbreak, there aren’t any treatments or vaccines available."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Malaria, Zika, dengue and chikungunya are also endemic in some regions affected by Oropouche virus,” the report notes. Indeed, Oropouche can mimic dengue and chikungunya with similar symptoms of fever, chills, headache and myalgias, which can often cause the infection to be misdiagnosed. It primarily spreads from biting midges such as &lt;em&gt;Culicoides paraensis, &lt;/em&gt;but like Zika, it can be transmitted via certain mosquitoes (&lt;em&gt;Culex quinquefasciatus &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Aedes serratus.&lt;/em&gt;) Non-human primates, including howler monkeys and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/03/02/our-thirst-for-pineapple-may-be-causing-mutations-in-costa-ricas-sloths/" target="_blank"&gt;sloths&lt;/a&gt;, can &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240829-oropouche-the-mysterious-sloth-virus-with-no-treatment"&gt;also be infected with Oropouche&lt;/a&gt;, which is why the disease is sometimes nicknamed “sloth fever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infection can be prevented by wearing long-sleeved clothing and using mosquito nets, as well as chemical insect repellents such as DEET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As this is a recent outbreak, there aren’t any treatments or vaccines available, and vaccine development pipelines are in their infancy (pre-clinical),” Vaughan explained. But “arbovirus vaccines“ meant to target viruses transmitted by arthropods and insects “have been recently approved in many countries,” he said, including vaccines for dengue and Chikungunya, which are similar but more severe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the dengue vaccines has been authorized for use in the U.S.,” he continued, but only for patients with evidence of previous infection. “If Oropouche continues to circulate for a few more years and there is confirmatory evidence of birth defects in pregnant travelers then it is likely a vaccine will be prioritized.” That, however, would take years to move through the approval process.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with other pathogens, from &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/01/12/whats-causing-bird-flu-to-surge-probably-climate-change-experts-say/"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/10/21/mosquito-borne-illnesses-are-picking-up-speed-experts-say-americans-are-unprepared/"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt;, the increase in Oropouche infections can be explained partially by global heating and the ongoing destruction of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Climate change has allowed the expansion of mosquito vectors into new areas exposing more humans,” Vaughan said. “Also, degradation of natural habitats have driven mosquitos into surrounding areas. Ease of travel (airplanes) and the relative lack of symptoms with Oropouche allow infected patients to carry the virus over long distances to new areas without detection, then expose a new population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters, surveillance of the Oropouche virus is likely imperiled by &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/rfk-jr-gives-elon-musks-doge-free-rein-to-raid-the-health-agency/"&gt;recent cuts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the Trump administration’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/04/sitting-ducks-trumps-withdrawal-from-the-could-put-the-us-at-risk-for-viral/" target="_blank"&gt;pull out of the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Decreased funding and inability to collaborate with international organizations will lead to increased threats from emerging pathogens,” including Ebola, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/08/17/mpox-shines-light-on-global-health-disparities/"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt; and Zika virus, Vaughan said. “Without properly supported surveillance networks, infections (including Oropouche) will continue to enter and circulate in the population prior to being recognized with the possibly of severe consequences.” He said he hoped the CDC would “continue to be the most important organization to identify, monitor and advise the public of ongoing and emerging) outbreaks. It is better to know which infections are going to cause the next outbreak (through surveillance) to act quickly allowing health authorities to make educated decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One significant outstanding question about Oropouche is whether it can spread via semen, which would effectively make it a sexually transmittable disease. Zika virus &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/hcp/sexual-transmission/index.html"&gt;can be spread this way&lt;/a&gt;, though the viruses are entirely different species. A 42-year-old Italian man who &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/12/24-1470_article"&gt;visited Cuba in July 2024&lt;/a&gt; contracted Oropouche fever, with tests revealing he was shedding the virus in his semen, though it’s not yet clear if that means infection can spread from person to person this way. “Our findings raise concerns over the potential for person-to-person transmission of [Oropouche virus] via sexual encounters and may have implications for sperm banking and assisted reproductive technologies,” a report in Emerging Infectious Diseases states, adding that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there have yet to be any reports of Oropouche infections in the U.S. or Canada and it’s still not entirely clear how damaging the virus can be to the health of babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Currently, the number of cases in the U.S. remains low,” Vaughan said. “However, the possibility of infection is greater with travel to the Caribbean and South America. The possible association with birth defects is still under investigation. I would recommend that pregnant travelers discuss their travel itinerary with a travel health professional to determine their individualized risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

Those hours leading up to bedtime can help set the stage for a blissful night’s sleep, so we consulted nutrition experts about their own nighttime choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nighttime Starts With Breakfast — Wait, Hear Us Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything you’ve eaten during the day could have an impact on your sleep that night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that exercise during the day promotes better sleep, and, in a similar way, eating balanced meals throughout the day leads to fewer cravings and snacking,” said registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/passthechia" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Emily Villaseca" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/passthechia" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Emily Villaseca&lt;/a&gt;. “If you’re trying to squeeze in a meal at the end of the day, or find yourself mindlessly or uncontrollably snacking, I’d encourage you to look beyond those last couple of hours and see how your whole day of eating is impacting your sleep hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a day full of good choices, you arrive at dinnertime, where the goal is a balance of protein, vegetables, healthy fats and complex carbohydrates, said RDN &lt;a href="https://www.mpmnutrition.com/about" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Marissa Karp" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mpmnutrition.com/about" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Marissa Karp&lt;/a&gt;. If you choose turkey or fish, which are high in tryptophan, that might help with sleep later on, she said. “It’s an amino acid that promotes serotonin production and can help make you sleepy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Stop Eating Before Bed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts suggest leaving at least a couple hours between the last time you eat and lights out. It’s a delicate balance, of course, because going to bed hungry could keep you up. Still, it’s smart to pay attention to timing and your body’s reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you tend to eat close to bedtime and are having trouble falling asleep, try eating something about two hours before going to bed,” said RDN &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/chelseyamernutrition" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Chelsey Amer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/chelseyamernutrition" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Chelsey Amer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cory Mygrant" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corymygrant" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Cory Mygrant&lt;/a&gt;, RDN at WellTheory, said that &lt;em&gt;when &lt;/em&gt;you’re eating can make as much of a difference as &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you’re eating. “Human circadian biology plays a role in how we metabolize food,” she said. “Our insulin sensitivity follows a natural rhythm, being higher in the morning and decreasing at night as our metabolic processes slow down.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means our bodies are more efficient at processing carbohydrates earlier in the day, making it beneficial to front-load food intake, especially if we are eating higher carbohydrate foods, and taper off as the evening progresses. Research suggests that finishing meals earlier can improve metabolic health and reduce inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What To Eat Earlier Or Avoid Altogether For Better Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you chose to eat can make a big difference in the type of night you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating a really sugary snack before bed might leave you dramatically hungry in the morning or up at night with a growling stomach,” Villaseca said. If you do love to have a sweet treat at night, you might want to have it earlier in the evening, said RDN &lt;a href="https://www.consumerhealthdigest.com/author/shelley-balls" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Shelley Balls" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.consumerhealthdigest.com/author/shelley-balls" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Shelley Balls&lt;/a&gt;, nutritionist for &lt;a href="https://www.consumerhealthdigest.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Consumer Health Digest" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.consumerhealthdigest.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Consumer Health Digest&lt;/a&gt;. “If I do have a dessert, I eat it with dinner or soon after, so it doesn’t spike my blood sugar levels as much compared to eating it alone later in the night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you drink is just as important as what you eat. “Caffeine and alcohol both have the potential to interfere with sleep, and some sleep experts recommend no caffeine after noon,” said RDN &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting#/search/cochrane" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Samantha Cochrane" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting#/search/cochrane" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Samantha Cochrane&lt;/a&gt; of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Depending on how caffeine affects you, you may be OK with an afternoon pick-me-up, like a coffee, tea or soda, into the early afternoon, but remember that 400 milligrams per day is the highest recommended amount adults should consume.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although some people think alcohol will help with sleep, avoid it before bed, as it interferes with sleep quality,” Cochrane said. Her view is echoed by Mygrant, who said, “I know a lot of people love to wind down with a glass of vino at night, but unfortunately, alcohol can mess with sleep quality more than you’d think.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Grace Cary via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Grace Cary via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Since chocolate can contain caffeine, nutritionists don't suggest eating it close to bedtime. And yet, many of them favor it as a bedtime snack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Here’s What I Eat At Bedtime’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I do like to have a sweet treat many nights of the week,” Villaseca said. “Many times, that’s a handful of chocolate chips. Sometimes it’s apple slices with peanut butter. Recently, I’ve really enjoyed a glass of reduced-fat milk to go along with these options, because it adds protein to my chocolate chips and leaves me more satisfied than just the snack alone.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Lots of nights I’ll have a post-dinner sweet treat, but I keep the portion size small so that I don’t end up feeling uncomfortable or having blood sugar crashes later on,” Karp said. “I love having frozen fruit and chocolate chips.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“As a mom of young kids, I eat dinner early, around 5:30 p.m., so I typically need a nighttime snack to avoid being over-hungry by bedtime,” Amer said. “My go-to snack is typically popcorn with pumpkin seeds. Popcorn is a whole grain rich in B vitamins, and pumpkin seeds are rich in magnesium. Both of these nutrients help support melatonin production, which is the sleep hormone that can help with rest and relaxation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I love a yogurt bowl with fresh strawberries and bananas before bed,” said RD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://smnutritionrd.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Stephanie Militano" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://smnutritionrd.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stephanie Militano&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Yogurt is a great source of protein, and the fruit supplies fiber, vitamins and minerals to support overnight muscle repair.

Plus, almond butter and pumpkin seeds are rich in magnesium, which helps to promote calmness and relaxation. The mix of carbs and healthy fat from the snack promotes falling asleep and staying asleep from a blood sugar standpoint.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This Drink Sends Me Right To Sleep’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warm drinks are another popular choice at bedtime. “I often rely on tea in the evening instead of a snack,” said registered dietitian (RD) &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/realnutrition/?api=Top%2Bpartners%F0%9F%8E%88We%2Btailor%2Bour%2Bsolutions%2Bto%2Byour%2Bneeds%2Bas%2Ban%2Binvestor.%2B.wbao&amp;amp;hl=af" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Amy Shapiro" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/realnutrition/?api=Top%2Bpartners%F0%9F%8E%88We%2Btailor%2Bour%2Bsolutions%2Bto%2Byour%2Bneeds%2Bas%2Ban%2Binvestor.%2B.wbao&amp;amp;hl=af" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Amy Shapiro&lt;/a&gt;, the lead nutritionist at ButcherBox. “I love lemon balm tea for its relaxing effects, but I try to stop drinking liquids an hour before bed to prevent middle-of-the-night bathroom breaks.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;RDN &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/sharonpalmerrd" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Sharon Palmer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d443b5e4b0c55eb8c10d1c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/sharonpalmerrd" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sharon Palmer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; also likes to unwind with a warm bevvie. “I always have chamomile tea every night to help with sleep,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Get Our Lifestyle Coverage Ad-Free&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

Experts say this trend is permeating Gen-Z. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while there are many factors at play, the overuse of injectables such as &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/botox/index.html" id="mol-f6aad2f0-f54a-11ef-add8-d702b71373fb" class="class"&gt;Botox&lt;/a&gt; and filler are one of the main culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has spoken to top plastics experts to understand why these procedures are backfiring and what other pitfalls could be at play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Auriel Willette, an associate professor who specializes in aging research at Rutgers University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-086e4d20-f52b-11ef-afa6-c762aac65cd9"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, says Botox and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/fillers/index.html" id="mol-f6684bb0-f54a-11ef-add8-d702b71373fb" class="class"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; are being used too early by young women, with some starting shots as teenagers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dermal fillers are injectable substances used to restore volume and improve facial contours. Dr Willette warns that their overuse&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;at a young age can 'stretch the skin' and lead to a puffy complexion or 'pillow face'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mary Ghere, who runs a plastic surgery practice in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-87ef6790-f54f-11ef-add8-d702b71373fb" class="class"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Young stars have been turning heads recently - but not for the right reasons. Celebs such as Sabrina Carpenter, aged 25, look 'at least a decade older' than the stars of yesteryear, commentators are saying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Michelle Pfeiffer (left) looked fresh-faced at age 25, compared to Carpenter's more mature look at the same age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains that injectibles over-stetch the skin, damaging it, and meaning it produces less collagen and elastin to maintain youthfulness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the filler wears off, the skin cannot contract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[It] speeds up the aging process,' she says, 'which is usually the exact opposite outcome individuals who were getting injectable fillers were looking to achieve.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most popular areas for dermal filler include the lips, cheeks, and under-eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of women using them has increased close to threefold in the US over the past decade. In 2010, 1.8 million injectable procedures were performed, while in 2023 the number rose to 5.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most popular dermal filler brands are Juvederm, Restylane and Sculptra. They are all made using hyaluronic acid, a natural component of the skin, and experts say they offer a more natural look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Filler procedures cost between $700 and $900 per syringe, depending on the provider and location, are purported to help to plump the skin. They can also be used to contour the face when added to areas such as the jaw, chin and cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with fillers, overdone Botox has been outed as another contributor to quickened aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Willette, of Rutgers University, warns that because the chemical neurotoxin temporarily paralyzes muscles, certain areas of the face can 'weaken over time&lt;span&gt; sometimes leading to an aged appearance rather than a youthful one'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The same differences can be seen when an image of Natalie Portman at 28 is set alongside a portrait of Bella Thorne at the same age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mila Kunis (left) at 27 contrasted with Kylie Jenner at the same age appears younger with rounded features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Facial plastic surgeon Dr James Zins, based at the Cleveland Clinic, explains: &lt;/span&gt;'Botox actually blocks neuro-communication between the nerve and the muscle, causing weakening or paralysis of that muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If it's used for a prolonged period of time, it can cause some muscle atrophy, or wasting of the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It has been used in the calves, for example, by people who have large calves and want to slim them down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jennifer Levine is one of New York City's top plastic surgeons, with more than 20 years of experience. Along with Botox and fillers, she&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;says the rise of Ozempic and other weight-loss medications have led to women having gaunter, more aged appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While stars have always been under pressure to maintain slender frames, the rise of GLP-1 medications [such as Ozempic] has made many ladies whittle down in size,' she says. 'When you are thinner, your face tends to look older because we associate fuller faces with youth.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Backing up Dr Levine's claims, the TV star and personal trainer Jillian Michaels &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14425935/Beverly-Hills-plastic-surgeon-Ozempic-effects-JILLIAN-MICHAELS.html"&gt;recently did her own research into the aging effects&lt;/a&gt; of Ozempic and was horrified by what she found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The overuse of fillers and Botox has been outed as the culprit (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She revealed in an &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14425935/Beverly-Hills-plastic-surgeon-Ozempic-effects-JILLIAN-MICHAELS.html"&gt;exclusive Daily Mail column&lt;/a&gt; that her Beverly Hills plastic surgeon had told her that some of his celebrity patients on GLP-1 medications were 'aging in fast-forward', with some looking a decade older in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said their skin didn't just appear older but was actually behaving older, losing elasticity, gaining more wrinkles and healing slower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even the connective tissue or SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System), which structurally supports the face, was becoming thinner and weaker, Michaels explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having investigated further, she concluded: 'It seems that GLP-1 drugs may be accelerating the breakdown of structural proteins like collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid at an alarming rate'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She cited studies suggesting GLP-1 drugs potentially deactivate fat-derived stem cells in the upper dermal layers. These cells play a crucial role in skin integrity because they release messengers that stimulate fibroblasts to produce the key building blocks that maintain youthful, resilient skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So a combination of weight-loss drugs and overdone fillers could be just the recipe for accelerated aging, the experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-large mol-style-bold"&gt;But why are men looking younger? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bizarrely, while women are looking older than ever, the opposite can be said for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/tom-holland/index.html" id="mol-cef43020-e8bc-11ef-9a99-e9fb388a2167"&gt;Tom Holland&lt;/a&gt;'s teenage-like glow at almost 30 to &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/thomas-brodie-sangster/index.html" id="mol-cef393e0-e8bc-11ef-9a99-e9fb388a2167" class="class"&gt;Thomas Brodie-Sangster&lt;/a&gt;'s boyish looks at 34, experts say today's male stars &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14363615/model-olive-oil-hack-guess-old-kristina-lubovna.html"&gt;are looking younger than ever. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it's not just Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rutgers University's Dr Willette told the Daily Mail that he believes an increasing amount of estrogen in the environment is behind men everywhere maintaining their youthful looks for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He claims the steroid hormone, which is associated with the female reproductive organs and responsible for developing female sexual characteristics, is leaching into tap water via remnants of contraceptive pills in wastewater - and via agricultural runoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A vast amount of research has been done on the harmful effects of environmental estrogen but still little is known about the long-term consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert De Niro at age 48 (left) looks almost ten years older than Cillian Murphy at the same age (right). Murphy is known for his boyish looks, which have barely changed over the years &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Travolta aged 34 (left) looks like he could be Thomas Brodie-Sangster's father, despite the fact they're the same age in these photos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have found that estrogen has changed the sex of fish when levels in the surrounding water have been too high. One review concluded that there is inadequate monitoring of estrogen at drinking water treatment plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many plastic products can also release chemicals that mimic estrogen and trigger the same effects, experts claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes everything from fast-food cartons to sippy cups, meaning males are exposed to these man-made hormones from a very young age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the uptick in environmental estrogens, Dr Willette believes men could be developing 'softer and less rugged features'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical testosterone-to-estrogen ratio in men is generally considered to be around 10:1 to 20:1, meaning for every 10-20 units of testosterone, there is 1 unit of estrogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Willette says when this formula is now being disrupted, with more estrogen in men's bodies, which can lead to a softer facial appearance and reduced muscle mass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estrogen,&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Dr Willette says, also helps to support skin elasticity to prevent a sagging complexion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While higher estrogen levels could be a factor in men looking younger than ever, Dr Willette highlights that other contributors to slowed aging include genetics, diet and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He points out that people are more health-conscious than ever today, so 'men are making more of an effort to add more protein to their diet, stay hydrated, and pack in consistent sleep - key factors in collagen production and skin repair.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Alexander Blinski, who co-owns &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://getplump.com/"&gt;Plump&lt;/a&gt;, a chain of noninvasive cosmetic injectable clinics in New York, said more men than ever are now seeking out Botox and fillers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While, as our experts have explained, these injectables have a tendency to age women, some say they have the opposite effect on men because of the different ways in which they tend to be used by the two genders - with men often opting to use far less, for a more natural, less feminine look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Blinski says 'Bro-tox' is one of his most popular requests from men, along with cheek and chin filler for a more youthful yet defined look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beyond aesthetics, Dr Blinski says he has also seen a surge of interest around health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Michael Douglas at age 28 (left) looks a good decade older than Tom Holland at the same age (right), with lines on his forehead, bouffant hair and sideburns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rami Malek (right), age 43, is often praised for his youthfulness. At the same age, Jack Nicholson (left) was already sporting a receding hairline, pronounced forehead lines and undereye bags&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bill Murray, pictured here at 29, looks markedly older than Timothée Chalamet at the same age. Murray's puckered skin is a sad comparison to Chalamet's boyish looks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diets, exercise, and the avoidance of aging accelerators like smoking and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-b8dd6ef0-e8bc-11ef-9a99-e9fb388a2167"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; are now integral to how many men approach aging,' he says. 'The result? Today's men aren't just aging more slowly, they're redefining what aging looks like. Comparing them to stars of the 80s and 90s might feel jarring, but it highlights how lifestyle and science have collectively raised the bar for what "aging gracefully" truly means.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plastic surgeon &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.drjenniferlevine.com/"&gt;Dr Levine&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, says hair restoration treatments are another reason why men are looking better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Men are now keeping their hair full and taking measures in order to do so, particularly celebrities,' she said.

    &lt;p&gt;It is a little disquieting getting into a car with someone whose sense of smell is so famously acute. Milne, who grew up in Dundee, between the homes of her parents and grandparents, inherited from her grandmother a condition known as hyperosmia, meaning her sense of smell is heightened to the point of being a superpower. While most of us can tell from a sniff of the air that a neighbour has lit a barbecue, she can smell what a passer-by ate for breakfast or tell from a whiff of a book they are carrying what food was in their kitchen last night. As a child, a game of hide and seek was for her an exercise in scent-tracking. Her nose can even tell her when a woman has entered the menopause or if someone is pregnant, “which can be a bit awkward, though [pregnancy is] a lovely smell, actually”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of our meeting, Barran has politely warned me to avoid using fragranced products; not just perfume but also scented deodorant or shampoo. Milne dislikes being around synthetic fragrances. Lynx body spray is apparently particularly offensive to her ultra-sensitive olfactory receptors. There was once a bit of an incident when Milne was a guest on “that TV programme with the red sofa”. The presenter was over-fragranced and she was completely overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Department of Chemistry, Barran disappears to her lab and I chat with Milne over a coffee. Today she makes accommodations to reduce humanity’s assault on her nose, shopping online and avoiding busy spaces. As a school-leaver in the 1960s, though, she opted to train as a nurse, thrusting herself daily into what must surely have been a stinking personal perdition. Milne grins broadly. “The sluice. The metal bedpans. And yes, it wasn’t easy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milne doesn’t just smell; she trains her sense of smell. As a nurse, she began to build up a medical olfactory library. “I’ve always been… we call it nosiness but it’s a need for a knowledge of smell. What patients smelt like, that mattered to me. I would know if someone’s diabetes was going off. I could tell if someone was struggling post-operatively. The big one was walking into a Nightingale ward with 18 beds on it and smelling tuberculosis. It’s not musky like Parkinson’s. It’s more of an oily biscuit smell. I thought, ‘How am I going to deal with this? You can’t be here. I’ve got to sort something out.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past it was considered normal for doctors to use their nose to classify the ailments of a patient. “Diphtheria smelled sweet, scurvy smelled pungent, typhus smelled like freshly baked rye bread and scrofula, a type of tuberculosis, smelled like stale beer,” writes Jonas Olofsson in &lt;em&gt;The Forgotten Sense: The New Science of Smell&lt;/em&gt;. On the battlefields of the First World War, soldiers knew to dread the stench of gas gangrene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many mothers today probably can’t diagnose a specific illness, but say they notice an altered smell in an unwell child. In the modern Western hospital, however, smell is generally overlooked. So Milne used different tactics to deal with the tuberculosis situation. “There was a very nice consultant and I said to him” – she adopts a gossipy tone – “‘Well you should listen to all the things that man’s done. He’s been all over India…’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, albeit in a very different way, smell was an important part of Milne’s relationship with her husband Les. The two got together at a party when she was 16 “and that was it”. They were both very active: golf, squash and swimming were sports they enjoyed together. Meanwhile, Les went to university, qualified as a medic, and began to train as an anaesthetist. The couple were living in Cheshire and Les was 28 when Milne first noticed something odd. She had always loved her husband’s clean, musky smell; it had changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time Milne’s medical olfactory library failed her. It was another 17 years before Les was diagnosed with Parkinson’s, at the age of 45. Still more years after that he and Milne went to a Parkinson’s support group and, “The smell [of the inside of someone’s coat as they were taking it off] hit me.” She finally understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re looking to lose weight, tone up, or just boost your mental health, walking is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need any fancy equipment (although a comfortable pair of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-running-shoes"&gt;best running shoes&lt;/a&gt; or one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers &lt;/a&gt;can help) or a gym membership — just getting outside or getting off the subway a stop sooner can make a huge difference. But how do you increase your calorie burn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness editor and marathon runner, I use my daily dog walks as a form of active recovery — keeping my legs moving on days when I’m not doing a long run or workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walk for at least 30 minutes with my dog every single day, although I’ve never really worried about how many calories I’m burning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I wondered if there was a way to boost the calories I burnt on my daily walks, so I tried this one simple thing, read on to find out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-doing-this-one-thing-boosted-the-calorie-burn-on-my-daily-walks"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doing this one thing boosted the calorie burn on my daily walks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to increase the calorie burn on your walking workouts, there are a few easy things you can do. Firstly, you can add more hills to your walks — when you’re walking uphill, your leg muscles will be working harder to power up the incline, and your heart rate will increase with the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re opting to walk on a treadmill, set the incline to 5-10% and really notice the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DHGk2MCCryYMivbbAUEt9C" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DHGk2MCCryYMivbbAUEt9C slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if, like me, you live in a pretty flat area? I don’t think my dog would appreciate a drive to hilly routes before his walk, so instead, I decided to add intervals to my walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these intervals, I’d pick up the pace, walking faster and really thinking about my form. I’d suck my belly button into my spine to engage my abs, stand tall, and swing my arms as I powered along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the interval was complete, I’d return to my normal walking gait. I didn’t jog, but if you really wanted to up the ante, you could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day one, I opted for the following intervals for my 30-minute walk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm-up: 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2-minutes normal pace, 2-minutes faster pace — repeat 5 times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool-down: 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many calories you burn when walking depends on several factors — how much you weigh, how fast you’re walking, and your current fitness levels. While the exact numbers aren’t important, I noticed that these intervals dramatically increased how many calories I burnt at the end of the walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the week, I felt like I was up for more of a challenge, so decided to increase the length of the faster pace:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm-up: 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1-minute normal pace, 4-minutes faster pace — repeat 4 times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool-down: 5 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was easy to set up these intervals on my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review"&gt;Apple Watch 10&lt;/a&gt;, using the Create Workout function, however, if you don’t have one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt;, you could easily just use the timer function on your phone, or a stopwatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember it doesn’t have to be complicated — if timing your walks sounds too much like hard work, just count your steps and walk faster for 20 steps, then return to your normal walking pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Really think about swinging your arms and standing tall as you move, and grab some of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-workout-headphones" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-workout-headphones"&gt;best workout headphones&lt;/a&gt; to get that music pumping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A Wilson County man is turning to the public for help
fighting a battle he can’t win alone. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lee Underwood has been a Type I diabetic since he was a
child but has still maintained an active and adventurous lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Through the years, he’s navigated his diabetes while facing
other health issues, including overcoming colon cancer in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the fight grew dire when Lee was suddenly diagnosed
with stage 5 kidney failure. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“They said my kidneys were down to about 13% or something
function. That’s how I found out” Underwood said. “I’m a pretty busy person and
immediately started looking into ways I could take care of myself.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Several times a week, Underwood now starts his day at 4 a.m.
in the living room he and his wife have turned into a medical clinic. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He sits in a lounge chair, hooks up to a dialysis machine
with water flowing through pipes they had fitted specially through a nearby
wall, and undergoes treatment at home for several hours. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/wilson-county-coach-seeks-kidney-donor-march-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/wilson-county-coach-seeks-kidney-donor-march-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Then, he goes to work doing what he loves most: Coaching.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Underwood shared he tries not to let his diagnosis rule his life
but says traveling has become much tougher. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He must bring the equipment with him for dialysis, taking
roughly 30 boxes of saline bags on the road with him for even just one long
weekend out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I basically have to have 40 liters five times a week,” Underwood
said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The coach told WRAL News he knows he is running out of time to
find a donor.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/wilson-county-coach-seeks-kidney-donor-march-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/wilson-county-coach-seeks-kidney-donor-march-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Everybody knows me as a tennis coach. If I died tomorrow,
that’s probably what I’d want to be remembered as. I don’t want to be
remembered with this,” Underwood said gesturing toward the dialysis machine. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Underwood's wife, Cherie, shared seeing her loved one hooked
up to a machine takes an emotional toll on her every day. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I have been mad, I have been sad, I cry, I ask why. A lot
of emotions go through my mind,” Cherie Underwood said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cherie plays an active role in Lee’s care by preparing the
machine for his next dialysis treatment when she comes home on her lunch
breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The couple recounted how they meticulously track when to
empty the machine and swap out equipment every day. Cherie said it’s hard work,
but they don’t let it define them. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“You can’t let that take control,” Cherie said. “You still
have to live your life normally. He really does stick to that.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Sitting beside one another, Cherie admired her husband’s
strength facing the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“He has been so great through this whole thing and never
really complains,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lee is currently on a transplant list through ECU Greenville
and joining another in Richmond. However, he’s among roughly 90,000 people
across the country all vying for the same organ. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics#:~:text=Not%20everyone%20who%20registers%20as,more%20willing%20donors%20are%20needed."&gt;Kidneys
are the most sought-after transplant&lt;/a&gt;, according to the U.S. Health
Resources and Services Administration with the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/wilson-county-coach-seeks-kidney-donor-march-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/wilson-county-coach-seeks-kidney-donor-march-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the most recent data published in September
2024, 89,792 people were waiting for a kidney donor. The same dataset reported
just 27,332 transplants were done that year, with about 6,500 involving living
organ donors. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The Underwoods are hoping the public will see if they are a
match to become a living kidney donor. Instead of waiting on a list for a
deceased donor and hoping to be selected out of tens of thousands nationwide,
Lee could receive a donation directly from another person. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kidney.org/kidney-topics/becoming-living-donor#:~:text=If%20you're%20interested%20in,at%20the%20same%20transplant%20center."&gt;The
National Kidney Foundation explains&lt;/a&gt; someone interested in becoming a living
donor would need to be evaluated at a transplant center to ensure they are a
match and healthy enough to donate. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Living donors can contact ECU in Greenville to test to
become Lee's specific match by calling 252-847-9121 or applying through &lt;a href="http://ecuh.donorscreen.org"&gt;ecuh.donorscreen.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Donors typically spend one or two nights in the hospital
with follow-up appointments for up to six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/wilson-county-coach-seeks-kidney-donor-march-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/wilson-county-coach-seeks-kidney-donor-march-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The Underwoods told WRAL News their insurance would cover
all medical costs for a living donor. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Cherie said finding her husband a donor would change her
family’s life forever and the couple remains hopeful their phone will ring with
good news. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It would mean the world to me,” she said. “It would be a
lifetime of being thankful for that person. I know there’s somebody out there,
we just haven’t gotten to them yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The couple shared their story on Facebook and through local
support groups. Cherie explained her goal is to not only find her husband a
match but possibly help other families in the process through what’s called a
paired donation.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A paired donation occurs when a living donor isn’t
compatible with their intended recipient and instead swaps organs with another
incompatible donor-recipient pair.  &lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Lee said he would be excited to being able to travel longer
distances if he gets a transplant and is planning more visits to national parks.
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He tells WRAL News he’s visited 38 so far. The next one he aims
to check off is New River Gorge in his hometown of Fayetteville, West

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parts of the brain that are needed to remember words, and how these are affected by a common form of epilepsy, have been identified by a team of neurologists and neurosurgeons at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The new study, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/advance-article/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf067/8010718" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/i&gt;, found that shrinkage in the front and side of the brain (prefrontal, temporal and cingulate cortices, and the hippocampus) was linked to difficulty remembering words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new discovery highlights how the network that is involved in creating and storing word memories is dispersed throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly crucial for helping to understand conditions such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/epilepsy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, in which patients may have difficulty with remembering words. The researchers hope that their findings will help guide neurosurgical treatment for patients with epilepsy by helping surgeons to avoid parts of the brain important for language and memory, that may otherwise be affected, when doing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corresponding author, Professor John Duncan (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology) said, "Being able to remember and recall words is important for day-to-day memory to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Detailed MRI brain scans are used to find out the causes of epilepsy and can show if any parts of the brain are shrunken. By measuring the parts of the brain that are shrunken and how well a person can remember words, we can work out which parts of the brain are used for making and storing memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition, if medication has not stopped seizures occurring, this helps us to guide neurosurgical treatment for a person's epilepsy, to avoid damaging the parts of the brain that are needed for memory to work well."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In the first study of its kind, the researchers examined 84 people with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/temporal+lobe+epilepsy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; (epilepsy arising from the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/temporal+lobe/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;temporal lobe&lt;/a&gt; at the sides of the head) and hippocampal sclerosis (a condition in which part of the brain is scarred, and memory is affected) and 43 healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patients were divided into those with left-sided and right-sided hippocampal sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution MRI scans were used to measure the size and shape of different parts of the brain, including the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cerebral+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt; (the outer layer of the brain responsible for thinking, memory, attention, perception, awareness, and language) and specific areas within the hippocampus (the part of the brain that helps with learning, memory, and spatial navigation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All participants underwent standardized tests to assess their verbal memory. These tests were part of the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery, which measures how well people can remember and recall words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers then compared the memory test scores to the sizes of different brain areas, to see if smaller brain parts were linked to worse memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that smaller sizes in certain brain areas, like the prefrontal, temporal and cingulate cortices, and parts of the hippocampus, were linked to worse memory for words in people with epilepsy arising in their temporal lobes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings are also important for understanding how the brain organizes and remembers words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr. Giorgio Fiore (National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH) said, "This research is important as it helps us to understand how memory may fail and may help guide the designing of neurosurgical operations for epilepsy that will not make &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/memory/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; worse."&lt;/p&gt;

            For the first time, scientists say, they have evidence that using a biologic drug to remove sticky beta amyloid plaques from the brains of people destined to develop Alzheimer’s dementia can delay the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00042e6bw3f4t82o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers have been testing amyloid-removing therapies in a group of people who have rare genetic mutations that make it almost certain they’ll develop Alzheimer’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00052e6bq5s6s199@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study – which is small, including just a few dozen participants – is a follow-up to a randomized-controlled trial that found no significant benefits for people who were taking one of two amyloid-lowering therapies, compared with a placebo. The extension of the study doesn’t have a placebo control group and may be subject to important biases, so outside experts say the results, though striking, should be interpreted with caution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00062e6btokheyja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s part of a research effort called Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network, or DIAN. The study participants like to go by a different name, though.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00072e6bjrvzhcuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We like to call ourselves the X-Men because we are mutants, trying to save the world from Alzheimer’s disease,” said Marty Reiswig&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of Denver, who has been participating in the trial since 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00082e6bi1wpryjz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00024-9/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology, found that the risk of symptoms was cut in half for a small subset of 22 patients who had not shown any problems with memory or thinking and had been taking an amyloid-lowering drug called gantenerumab for an average of eight years. The results achieved statistical significance in one part of the analysis but not in others, perplexing outside experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggnlkq00002e6bq7y1l1u6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While this study does not conclusively prove that Alzheimer’s disease onset can be delayed and uses a drug that will not likely be available, the results are scientifically promising,” said Dr. Tara Spires-Jones, director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, in a statement to the media. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00092e6bwzdevmpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study authors believe&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that if people are started on therapy early enough and stay on it for enough time, it could forestall the development of the disease — perhaps for years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000a2e6bx0j6fbh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s “the first data to suggest that there’s a possibility of a significant delay in the onset of progression to symptoms,” said Dr. Eric McDade, a professor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis, who led the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000b2e6bcc4kp7r7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            McDade said this study has the longest-running data for any patients who started amyloid-lowering biologics while they were still free of symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000c2e6bg5b2g3qx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We think that there’s a delay in the initial onset, maybe by years, and then within those individuals that have some mild symptoms, even the rate of progression was cut by about half,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000d2e6b45bqvvm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The achievement of this long-hoped-for result comes with optimism but also panic, however.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000e2e6b98bjta93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research team says the meetings to review their National Institutes of Health grant funding have been canceled twice. Their grant has to be reviewed before they can be referred to what’s known as a council meeting, where funding decisions are made. If their grant misses a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;council meeting in May, the money for the study, which has been going since 2008, could run out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It ends up becoming a really difficult position we’re in and that the participants are in,” McDade said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000g2e6bhoqowejf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients could lose access to the study drugs, especially if they’re in countries where the medications haven’t been approved. If people can’t stay on the drugs, researchers may never find out how durable the benefit may be or be able to answer critical questions like for whom the medications work best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000h2e6bs5cywwui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keeping that group that has been on the amyloid drugs the longest is “absolutely critical,” McDade said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gibboj002j2e6bhube60nr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the 1980s, researchers studying the autopsied brains of people with Alzheimer’s discovered that they were clogged with sticky plaques made from beta amyloid proteins and toxic tangles made of a protein called tau. They theorized that removing these proteins from the brain might delay or even reverse the disease, and they began to hunt for therapies that could do that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000j2e6bjj20uj9b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For decades, scientists have been testing a range of biologic medications that recognize and remove beta amyloid proteins, with mostly lackluster results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000k2e6b1wey9uys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late-stage &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2304430" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; involving more than 1,800 people with early Alzheimer’s disease, one of these drugs, gantenerumab, slowed the progression of symptoms compared with a placebo, but it wasn’t a big enough benefit to pass a test of statistical significance, meaning the result could have been due to chance alone. It was considered a failed drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000l2e6bwagipwki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, two similar drugs — lecanemab, or Leqembi, and donanemab, or Kisunla — did meet the US Food and Drug Administration’s bar and were approved to treat people with Alzheimer’s who have mild symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000m2e6bl58q8z1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both therapies are expensive, may cause brain swelling and, in clinical trials, delayed the progression of symptoms by months compared with placebos. The modest benefits mean some doctors and patients to shy away from using them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000n2e6bi8bfus9x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers testing gantenerumab in people with gene mutations that set them up for Alzheimer’s in the DIAN got permission from the FDA to continue using the drug for as long as possible. When they couldn’t keep the participants on gantenerumab any longer, they switched them to its sister drug lecanemab.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000o2e6bg8rpvqdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sue, a study participant in Texas, has been in the gantenerumab arm of the trial since 2012. She joined the study shortly after she found out that she and three of her five siblings&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;had a gene mutation that made it almost certain they would develop early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ghcxxw00013b6m0lbw5vtj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of six children in her family, two brothers and two sisters have the mutation. One brother was tested but doesn’t have it, and another brother doesn’t want to be tested but remains free of symptoms. Two of her brothers and a sister developed symptoms around age 57. Sue, who at 61 is the youngest of her siblings,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000p2e6biuog6gim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m fine. I’m totally fine,” said Sue, who asked to be be identified only by her first name to protect family members who may also have the mutation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gj3vt300073b6mdmgnqdkg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her brothers, who were also in the trial but began taking the medication after they had developed symptoms, didn’t benefit as much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000q2e6bsa33wisv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When she started the study 13&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;years ago, she hoped she would contribute to scientific understanding of the disease. She has had 40 MRIs, 30 PET scans and more than a dozen lumbar punctures to collect her spinal fluid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ghehp200033b6mhbskl5z4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tests show that her brain and her thinking are normal. She gets “queen bee,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the top daily ranking,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the New York Times Spelling Bee game every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000r2e6ba7djkxnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I still feel like, fundamentally, I’m doing it to help the science, but at this point, it’s helping me,” she said. “I truly believe that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000s2e6bwst8yjds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sue believes the drugs have held off the disease for about four years for her. When the disease runs in families this way, she believes, there’s a pretty clear age when people start to decline, and she thinks the medication has pushed that back.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000t2e6bxp6h5eaa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After watching her brothers begin to decline, she worked with a financial planner to save as much money as possible and planned for an early retirement. Today, she’s still working part-time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000v2e6bbje5ihme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the study, the researchers recruited DIAN members who were cognitively normal or who had only mild symptoms, and who were in a window of time spanning 15 years before to 10 years after their estimated age of diagnosis. The researchers estimated the potential age at diagnosis by looking at the ages when other family members began showing symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000w2e6b2isyfd6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first phase of the study, participants were randomly assigned to take either gantenerumab, another amyloid-lowering drug called solanezumab or a placebo. That study ran from the end of 2012 to the beginning of 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ghhfn500053b6mxdvtx4uf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the end of that study, researchers allowed participants who had finished it to continue on gantenerumab in increasing doses for three years. That extension ran at 18 clinical trial sites in seven countries. In 2023, the drug’s sponsor, Roche, discontinued development of gantenerumab after disappointing study results made it unlikely to be approved by the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000x2e6bgbj977vn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study released Wednesday reports the results of this extension, in which all the participants – 73 – who continued on the therapy knew that they were on the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000y2e6b9m6l2h6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Study participants who took gantenerumab during either the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the study or only in the open extension had a modest benefit. Their odds of developing symptoms were cut by about 20%, but the result was not statistically significant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000z2e6b02kcmg3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the 22 people who had been on gantenerumab the longest – an average of eight years – the benefit was larger and statistically significant. The drug cut their risk of symptoms by almost half compared with people who were in an observational arm of the study, in which researchers were monitoring the progress of participants but not treating them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00102e6br5cjfnaw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reiswig, like many members of his family, carries a mutation in a gene called presenilin-2, which causes his brain to overproduce amyloid plaques. His relatives who carry the mutation begin showing Alzheimer’s symptoms between ages 47 and 50. Reiswig is 46.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00112e6b6bt0qca5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m staring the gun right down the barrel,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00122e6b71fqdknk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            His father also participated in DIAN in the observational arm but didn’t start the drug trial because he thought he was too sick to get any benefit. He died of Alzheimer’s in 2019, at the age of 66.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00132e6bt06q2pc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s old for our family,” Reiswig said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00142e6bd8l82fz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For years, Reiswig resisted finding out whether he carried the mutation, but he did get tested in 2020. When he learned that he had it, “I punched pillows, and I cried really hard,” Reiswig said. “It was the worst day ever.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00162e6bec0a5479@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “eventually, you run out of tears,” he said. He and his wife decided “we’re just going to get busy living,” because he didn’t know how many good years he might have after the age of 47.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00172e6bshjwog2l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reiswig started in the solanezumab arm of the study and switched to gantenerumab in the extension.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00182e6bddzrutoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He hasn’t seen any symptoms, but he also doesn’t know whether he’s actually getting any benefit from the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001b2e6bral9wb7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers who were not involved in the study said that even though it was small and not placebo-controlled, and the data is preliminary, it’s worth paying attention to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001c2e6bidfsdxbr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the context of all we have learned about the value of amyloid removal in sporadic AD, these data are encouraging,” Dr. Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California, wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001d2e6btfi28fvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aisen led &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559996/" target="_blank"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that tested solanezumab in people who had amyloid in their brains but didn’t have any symptoms. That study found no benefit to taking the drug, compared with a placebo, after more than four years of treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gioo1c002q2e6bkes6gyim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aisen believes that his study was negative because it tested a first-generation drug that didn’t remove amyloid as strongly as some of the newer ones do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001g2e6bp538c9yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He’s now leading another study testing lecanemab in patients who don’t have symptoms. Because a long treatment period is required to see results in this stage of the disease, Aisen says they won’t have results until 2028 or 2029.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001h2e6bfwwey0u4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Much more needs to be done, and additional major studies are in progress,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001i2e6bbhnk5nmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others said the results from the latest research were hard to interpret, given the biases that probably exist in the study population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001j2e6b0corohh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think there’s a clear signal here that this is working,” said Dr. Michael Greicius, a professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford University who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001k2e6b55cm95x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grecius said it’s difficult to compare this group of 22 people who continued on gantenerumab to people in the observational study, because people in the extension were able to join only if they finished the placebo-controlled trial. People who dropped out of the phase 3 study weren’t eligible to participate, which means participants in the extension had to be relatively healthy and doing better in the first place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001l2e6btzhqv8gd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These are big caveats,” Greicius said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001m2e6bzxz4lpku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He says the biomarker data included in the paper shows that as the researchers increased the drug dosage, they were able to remove more amyloid from the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001n2e6bj6jyge3j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But other biomarker data is less clear. PET imaging scans, for example, didn’t show much of a difference in the amounts of tau protein in the brain, even after extended treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001o2e6bk5g06i93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If there is a real effect here, Greicius says, it’s not likely to be a permanent one. “People are still progressing. They’re progressing more slowly than the control group.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001p2e6bv77jecsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though this data comes with a lot of uncertainty – or perhaps because it comes with so much uncertainty – Greicius says it’s even more important to continue the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001q2e6bezck9t7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is an invaluable study population,” he said. “Continuing to follow them on treatment may provide the best test of the amyloid hypothesis that the field can undertake and stands to provide critical evidence either for or against it. This should be highly prioritized for continued funding.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001s2e6b42d04vm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reiswig said it would be devastating if the study had to be stopped due to lack of funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001t2e6b0uw0e6bm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Personally, I’m terrified of that. I’ll be taken off of a life-saving drug and left to wait until symptoms begin to begin slowing the disease with Kisunla or Leqembi,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001u2e6bn2t6126x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He says he and the other DIAN participants have given decades of their lives to research, to developing a treatment, but then could be denied the drug they helped to test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001v2e6b5ic0d3vt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Honestly, that feels criminal to me,” he said. “We are so close to preventing the world’s most tragic and expensive disease.”

              &lt;p&gt;We might be on the precipice of a pivotal moment in Alzheimer’s disease research. In clinical trial data released this week, scientists have presented early evidence that it’s possible to delay symptoms in people genetically fated to develop Alzheimer’s at a young age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine led the study, which aimed to test whether an experimental anti-amyloid drug called gantenerumab could help people with an inherited form of Alzheimer’s. In a subset of patients treated the longest, the drug appeared to reduce their risk of developing symptoms as expected, by 50%. The findings will require a follow-up, but outside experts are cautiously optimistic about what this could mean for the future of treating Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The results make it clear that there is good hope that treatment of [Alzheimer’s] pathology in the preclinical stages of pathology may be effective at slowing or preventing disease onset,” Thomas M. Wisniewski, the director of the Center for Cognitive Neurology at NYU Langone Health, who is not affiliated with the research, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/therapeutics/gantenerumab"&gt;Gantenerumab&lt;/a&gt; is one of many similar drugs that scientists have developed for Alzheimer’s. It’s a lab-made antibody that targets beta amyloid, one of two proteins thought to play a critical role in causing Alzheimer’s (the other being tau). In people with Alzheimer’s, a misfolded version of amyloid beta builds up in the brain, forming into hardy clumps known as plaques that eventually riddle the organ. Scientists have theorized that it’s possible to stop or at least slow down Alzheimer’s with drugs such as gantenerumab that break up and prevent these plaques from forming.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it hasn’t been a smooth ride for this hypothesis. Many anti-amyloid drugs have shown promise early on, only to fail in larger trials that tested them for people already beginning to experience Alzheimer’s symptoms. That list includes gantenerumab; in late 2022, pharmaceutical company Roche &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/roche-shutters-most-trials-alzheimers-drug-after-failed-trials-2022-12-01/"&gt;shut down its development&lt;/a&gt; of the drug after a pair of Phase III trials failed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But more recent anti-amyloid drugs have demonstrated a modest but noticeable effect in slowing down Alzheimer’s, enough to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Some researchers, including at WashU Medicine, hoped that anti-amyloid treatment could be more effective when administered long before the appearance of Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starting in 2012, the researchers and others launched prevention trials testing anti-amyloid agents in people with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s, a genetic condition that all but guarantees the development of dementia sometime between a person’s 30s and 50s. Most of these trials haven’t yielded success, except possibly for the one with gantenerumab.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the original gantenerumab study concluded in 2020, the researchers found that it reduced people’s amyloid levels. But it was too early to know whether it might delay people’s symptoms, since most patients at the start of the study weren’t expected to become sick for another 10 to 15 years. The researchers then decided to openly provide gantenerumab to its patients (including those who were taking a placebo or another drug) as part of an extension study.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“Everyone in this study was destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease and some of them haven’t yet.”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the latest results from this study, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00024-9/abstract"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in The Lancet Neurology, that has people excited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everyone in this study was destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease and some of them haven’t yet,” said senior author Randall J. Bateman, a professor of neurology at WashU Medicine, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1077229"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “We don’t yet know how long they will remain symptom-free—maybe a few years or maybe decades.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;That said, there are important caveats to the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For one, the findings only hint at a potential preventative benefit, Wisniewski notes. Though the drug may have reduced the risk of cognitive decline in the overall larger group of symptomless people, this reduction wasn’t statistically significant (possibly because of the study’s low patient numbers, 73 in total, Wisniewski says). In the subset of asymptomatic patients who were treated the longest—about eight years on average—the drug seemed to reduce their expected chances of cognitive decline by 50%. But this subset only included 22 patients, an even smaller sample size.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial also ended earlier than expected for many patients due to Roche’s abandonment of the drug, and some people dropped out for other reasons. The drug appeared to be generally safe and tolerable, though about a third developed amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIAs, which are markers of swelling or bleeding of the brain. ARIAs are a known side-effect of these drugs, though most episodes are unnoticed by patients. Two patients did experience severe ARIAs, which prompted the researchers to stop treatment, after which they recovered. No life-threatening events or deaths were reported during the study.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, the study is not definitive proof that anti-amyloid drugs can work for Alzheimer’s this far in advance. But since this form is essentially inevitable, these results are the first from a clinical trial to suggest it could be treated. Coupled with the earlier approvals of lecanemab and donanemab for the classical version of the neurodegenerative disorder, there does seem to be something real here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We already know from the lecanemab and donanemab data that anti-amyloid antibodies (AAAs) can slow progression of common, sporadic Alzheimer’s,” Sam Gandy, associate director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at Mount Sinai, told Gizmodo. “This paper focuses on using a different AAA (gantenerumab) to demonstrate a similar phenomenon is true in genetic early onset Alzheimer’s,” added Gandy, who’s not affiliated with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gandy, Wisniewski, and the study researchers themselves all agree that this is only the beginning. There are indeed prevention trials ongoing right now for both early-onset and &lt;a href="https://www.aheadstudy.org/"&gt;classic Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-drug-prevent-alzheimers-disease-decades-before-it-happens-2000559730"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; being run by WashU through its Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network-Trials Unit. These trials are testing approved and newer experimental anti-amyloid drugs that could show even more of a protective benefit than gantenerumab. The researchers were also able to switch many of their patients in the original extension study to lecanemab, though the data from this phase remains to be analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s early days, but there might be genuine hope for this incurable disease on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Being a doctor was incompatible with their reality in an impoverished rural settlement, with houses on stilts by a stream on the outskirts of Manaus, the capital of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;’s Amazonas state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“He told me medicine was for those who have money, not humble people like us,” she recalls. “But I had some kind of decisive faith when I was a girl, a certainty of myself. When people told me something wouldn’t work out, I did it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Her determination led her to pursue an exceptional life mission: to become both a medical doctor and a shaman, integrating these very separate systems of knowledge and mediating disputes that often arise in Indigenous healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Danielle Soprano Pereira, as she was baptised in Portuguese, is part of a generation of Indigenous people who have gradually had more access to universities thanks to affirmative action policies in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In 2012, a place at university took her 4,000km (2,500 miles) from home and made her a resident in a city of 2.3 million – Belo Horizonte. At the prestigious &lt;a href="https://ufmg.br/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Federal University of Minas Gerais&lt;/a&gt; (UFMG), she was no longer seen as gifted but as “different” – the first Indigenous person from the Amazon to gain a coveted place at the medical school, mainly the preserve of Brazil’s elite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a0d123b2-7ccf-4d9b-b079-349a38151f36" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Adana says other medical students were bothered by her presence. ‘I learned first-hand that prejudice can be covert.

The standard duration of the medical course was six years, but she decided to respect her personal rhythm. “The medical course leaves no time for sleep, leisure or to live one’s own humanity. This goes against what we learn with nature, which is to respect our limits,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In 2017, she almost had a breakdown. At home, alone, she questioned aloud how she would become a doctor and a shaman. She heard a voice and spoke to it. She said she would only keep going if certain situations arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The next day in the hospital, Adana says all the conditions she had set happened, one after the other. She cried in the hallway. “Something inside me said, ‘This is your mission.

She also demanded Indigenous groups be heard over the exploitation of their ancestral knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Indigenous people are not invited to the conversation, and nature is seen as if it were here to serve us. It is not,” she told the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Adana is also a musician (she plays the violin) and actor who starred in the Brazilian film &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNvqgNZwwIQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=TatuiFilmes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Xingu&lt;/a&gt;. So she felt comfortable finishing her presentation by singing an &lt;em&gt;a cappella&lt;/em&gt; ode to Mother Nature while shaking rattles made of seeds. The crowd burst into applause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n 1999, Brazil created within its public healthcare system a specific subsystem for Indigenous people, devising an intercultural approach to respect their beliefs and employ Indigenous people as healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the doctor and anthropologist Luiza Garnelo, however, these ideals are not easily translated into everyday practice, as she has found during her research with Amazonian communities around the Rio Negro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Most Indigenous professionals in the subsystem are community healthcare agents and nurse technicians, lower in the pyramid when compared to doctors. And being Indigenous doesn’t necessarily give them the right to create new ways of providing care,” says Garnelo, a researcher with the &lt;a href="https://portal.fiocruz.br/en/foundation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Oswaldo Cruz Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;For a doctor striving to become a &lt;em&gt;pajé&lt;/em&gt;, Garnelo says it is difficult to reconcile the principles of scientific biomedicine – strictly based on symptoms, examinations, diagnostics and medications – with Indigenous medicinal practices, in which body, mind, soul and context are seen in confluence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This is often an issue when Indigenous people seek treatment, as healthcare providers may show disregard for Indigenous beliefs. In turn, Indigenous people at times avoid hospitals or reject medical intervention, preferring to trust their shamans and healers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="cce25320-4915-4184-a241-f9de9fd67abd" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-19ds8t4"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Adana is consulting two shamans on her path towards becoming a spiritual leader.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Marizilda Cruppe/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Adana recalls a case around the Rio Negro where a Tukano Indigenous man was bitten by a snake and doctors said his leg would have to be amputated. His family abandoned the hospital and treated the wound with sap from a vine. His leg was saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Recently, she mediated a standoff in the intensive care unit of the Sofia Feldman hospital in Belo Horizonte. An Indigenous child had presumed sepsis and needed urgent medical intervention but his father, a shaman, opposed the doctors’ recommendation. Adana stepped in and promised to say an Indigenous prayer in the intensive care unit. The family allowed the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The family listened to me because I am Indigenous preparing to be &lt;em&gt;pajé&lt;/em&gt;. The doctors listened to me because I am a doctor,” she says. The father later said that Adana’s prayer had saved the child. “The doctors said it was the antibiotic,” she laughs. “What matters is that we managed to save a life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Adana continues to consult the two shamans mentoring her on the pathway towards becoming a spiritual leader. If she succeeds in becoming a &lt;em&gt;pajé&lt;/em&gt;, she plans to invite both her worlds to the festivities – celebrating with doctors and shamans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gFBVV95cUxNOEVYeUlEQmdLaUtFR1FDdW5OcFdKaWhSNjZoTmVpbDVGSV9ieHByc01lVU1raDJPa1U3d0R2dnpHeUhzcVNIbktzWUVNTlJKdE9XUkQzX1pLQThkMUdkaDBCNnRmTGFHQ2Y3R0o4c3lDb25JVEVjX1hkUHlncENSSThyREdZNXlLb1hrUjhOcmpGMjBJamU2UUZpd3JuNS0zbmluNEdQc19YREhWSktjWW1NU3hZdXBVcFd3MDBiLTgydzd3NGhxSGN4eDF1M0ZlSjhxcFJn</guid></item><item><title>Houston janitor who urinated in water bottles at doctor’s office, spreading STDs to workers sentenced to prison - KPRC Click2Houston</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5wFBVV95cUxQWVZQbEFLbWhhM0J3UHF5Y3NzbWJra2tQdUhIdFlmYzZvZ3BkUmhWZlM4SURnQkxHSVBZLWtmQTdacmtWVDh2TUpvVTN2YmNPb3Jhend5RzBRcEhiU0NtVVc4RGpNaFcyOVVMMTYwNTN5QU9pZjFCeDk2eU9WZlRnSm5QSDNVUHdPbGg3S2xwX1hiQW1vZ2lhSENYNGJsVU1TRHFkd2FhT3FnQjVnNGNSVUtvQjJLSGF1YkoxWXhHUmttUzZteTBLc1BVXzM5WlVpRGdVZVVibWJ5UzRPYWJsY3haN3dZUXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOUSTON&lt;/strong&gt; – A man with multiple sexually transmitted and communicable diseases was sentenced to six years in prison for urinating into office workers’ water bottles, resulting in the victims contracting herpes simplex 1 and hepatitis A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Lucio Catarino Diaz was sentenced on Tuesday after pleading guilty to an aggravated assault with deadly weapon charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;According to prosecutors, Diaz already served more than two years behind bars.

I've done pretty much a little bit of everything,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also came out as gay in 1997. The year after I graduated high school. Mixed emotions in the family made it hard to stay at home," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp said he would panhandle for money after becoming addicted to drugs, and when that failed to produce the cash needed, he would steal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I mean that's not acceptable anywhere you go. But it was a way of life, and when it becomes a way of life it's very hard to get away from it again, which was my issue,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also moved around a lot: living in tents or other covered areas along Airport Way, Industrial Way, under I-5 in North Seattle, under the helipad at Harborview Medical Center, an old pump house in Normandy Park, and Cal Anderson Park in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had so many friends out there on the streets that I knew where to go and, quite frankly, where I could get it for nothing. It came through a lot of tricking, and you, know prostituting and selling myself,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food, he said, was a day-to-day thing, and not nutritious since he had no way of cooking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've lost a lot of friends. I mean, death, just drugs and malnutrition because of homelessness. And it's sad,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Bouwkamp was diagnosed with HIV.  He was receiving care at Harborview Medical Center in 2019 when he really started showing signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he said his father died from a life of partying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got depressed and I stopped taking my medications. And I stopped really caring about my own health. I was a very rampant addict at that point.  I couldn't live without the drug,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illicit drugs combined with a lack of real drugs to treat his HIV and severe malnutrition brought Bouwkamp to the darkest time in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well, I was living outdoors. I was living at Cal Anderson Park across the street, and there's a Central Lutheran church. The guy that runs the place or does the groundskeeping kept coming up to the park and saying, 'You know, you're getting pretty sick there and you should go to the hospital,' and I never listened,” Bouwkamp explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time, he refused the help. But the man kept coming back day after day, as Bouwkamp said he got sicker and sicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And finally on May 5 of 2020, he walked up to me and said 'Eric if you don't let us call you an ambulance today you're gonna die right here. And we can't let that happen.' And he said 'Will you please let us call you an ambulance?' I broke down and I said, 'Yeah, I'm ready.' I said I'm ready to go.  I don't want to die out here,” Bouwkamp recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in his deteriorated state of being, Bouwkamp asked that the ambulance come without any sirens or lights and just quietly take him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp spent the next four months at Harborview.   On top of his HIV, doctors diagnosed him with a staff infection, strep, syphilis, secondary syphilis, and pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very near-death experience that helped me turn my direction in life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp reconnected with his mother and sister when he was better, and that’s when he learned they had been searching for him two months before that ambulance ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mom and sister decided to come to downtown Seattle and looked for me in Cal Anderson Park.  They stood right over me bickering if it was me or not. I heard their voices.  I was just too weak to respond, but they walked away,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said his mom still feels guilty, so he reassures her that it just wasn’t meant to be that day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this game of life, he says we’re given a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp eventually started making the choices he needed to be making. Now he is in an apartment, living independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gives great credit to the Bailey Boushay House in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since 1992 (they) have been giving care to people living with HIV and AIDS. In March of this year they informed me that I was being presented with a housing voucher that would pay my rent. At that point I moved into my apartment,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, with stable housing and his cat Einstein by his side, he has aspirations to become a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm gonna get my certification for nursing assistant,” Bouwkamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, he plans to find a job and enroll in nursing school to become a registered nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp also wants to inspire others, to hold out hope for change and never give up on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don't ever think that that there's no hope. Because there is, as long as you put your mind to it and you say 'Hey things are gonna be okay.' And you take that first step, put your best foot forward, and then let your other foot follow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing that, he said it’s important to see the people who really are trying to help and accept it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh man, in the last, say, ten years I've had at least a dozen people who've been willing to help me. But I didn't want help for myself because I wasn't ready. It was always extended to me.  People who are still experiencing homelessness and addiction, it can be lonely. It can be tough but fight for it.  Fight for yourself,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More information on the Bailey Boushay House and its services can be found &lt;a href="https://www.baileyboushay.org/" target="_blank" title="https://www.baileyboushay.org/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;HERE. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:47:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNWXg2Nll4VUZ1cndnX19nWjVGMVVRS3NxTEVTcEoyMFZIX3dhaTdBY2FmZ05wcHVxTVk0a3drRFFyWXpJYVg5XzVpWnJCNHdBSEt2TW5Ld0VNeTJHTVpDWmxUbFlESERjWlNrVGJJSHc4UG5jTHNGZjB5YllLQXdsWmMzY0p1RDhVbVo2MUlGRWdTSnM4OTRxYmRaSmo2YkNCUmg2emFqTmE</guid></item><item><title>Trump Administration Considers Scaling Back H.I.V.

Trump unveiled a bold initiative to end the H.I.V. epidemic in the United States by 2030 by focusing on 57 jurisdictions with the most urgent needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The plan, which Mr. Trump announced in 2019 at a State of the Union address, surprised advocacy groups. But it was widely lauded, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;and successful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;By 2022, the plan had driven down new infections nationwide by 30 percent in adolescents and young adults, and by roughly 10 percent in most other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;This time around, the Trump administration’s stance on H.I.V. appears to be much the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services is now considering shutting down the H.I.V. prevention division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and shifting some of its activities to a different agency, according to federal officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The C.D.C. provides funds to states and territories for detecting and responding to H.I.V. outbreaks, prevention, syringe exchange, expanded testing in emergency rooms and education and awareness.

&lt;span&gt;According to the latest update from the Texas Department of State Health Services, 279 measles cases have been reported in the state. In New Mexico, 38 cases have been confirmed as of Tuesday, totaling &lt;strong&gt;317 cases across both states&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;In 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed &lt;strong&gt;285 cases&lt;/strong&gt; nationally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The cases have primarily occurred in &lt;strong&gt;Gaines County, Texas&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Lea County, N.M.&lt;/strong&gt;, which sit opposite each other on the Texas-New Mexico border. Of the cases in Texas, 36 have resulted in hospitalizations, while two people have been hospitalized in New Mexico.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;There have been two deaths, one in each state, related to the current measles outbreak, and both occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. The death in Texas was directly attributed to measles, while the cause of death for the New Mexican individual, who tested positive for the virus, is still being investigated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The numbers coming out of Texas have &lt;strong&gt;fluctuated&lt;/strong&gt; as more information is gathered, with there apparently being fewer breakthrough measles cases than initially believed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Texas health authorities found that after further investigation, three cases previously considered vaccinated were not. Two of the individuals had received a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine dose just one to two days before symptoms began, while the third case appeared to have been a reaction to the vaccine and was not a true infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It takes &lt;strong&gt;14 days&lt;/strong&gt; after vaccination for the body to develop an immunity to measles, and it is only at that point at which someone is considered fully vaccinated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hill</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:37:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOMlJ6cmFPTENvc1FaSHlYX2VTc2xhTV8xUzV2ZXdOdkJmMFEwSkdnVE9VZUpMMHhyLUFWNlJPd1pMVmlXWEtSOXB4NFpEM2kzU1ppMVVYYTdZQnZ6S0hEalRUb2RiUHpxSVk4akJYQlBlRXd2cGxUaEdybGIycFF5VHUydGFRdXRFdXBscmVHONIBlAFBVV95cUxOUTZaTm1GamJxazk0SXlCRUZFMDlkeGQ1bjJkTk1Md2RQUmpEQno1S0V0a1RVdGdULW1YRlhqaF9rTHlmTnlDRldZRWRVMG1DeXZsUnZCWVNTem9COUl3alNndE92LUNKNk43eDlLNEhhOFhmNkw1cDVKaExTMDFQUVVQTExpQW9rN0FTQnk3cERmaWdQ</guid></item><item><title>Bird flu continues spread as Trump’s pandemic experts are MIA - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQMHZ6OGhNYzRMZGFnNXZaMDlLM1VuR2dpbkx5X0J6b3Q0WDhwc3lSUjR4dHlYX0ZuWmpQSEJGVWRlVi13NTJ2X3BfUWU3Smt3Ym4zdzduQzZvNmo0Q21zNWxKR2t4Smpib3lvQzZjMnB1VDRoOEwxTmNPdXdxWk5TcVhMd2FtNzVBMzB3WUNmdGh6WkpsY2tmajFtVjA2a21BU0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;Under the Biden administration, OPPR also worked behind the scenes. At the time, it was directed by Paul Friedrichs, a physician and retired Air Force major-general. Friedrichs told CNN that the OPPR regularly hosted interagency calls between the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the USDA, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health. When the H5N1 bird flu outbreak erupted in dairy farms last March, OPPR was hosting daily meetings, which transitioned to weekly meetings toward the end of the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At the end of the day, bringing everybody together and having those meetings was incredibly important, so that we had a shared set of facts," Friedrichs said. "When decisions were made, everyone understood why the decision was made, what facts were used to inform the decision."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who co-wrote the bill that created OPPR with former Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), is concerned by Trump's sidelining of the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Under the last administration, OPPR served, as intended, as the central hub coordinating a whole-of-government response to pandemic threats,” she said in a written statement to CNN. "While President Trump cannot legally disband OPPR, as he has threatened to do, it is deeply concerning that he has moved the statutorily created OPPR into the NSC."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As intended by law, OPPR is a separate, distinct office for a reason, which is especially relevant now as we are seeing outbreaks of measles, bird flu, and other serious and growing threats to public health," Murray wrote. "This should be alarming to everyone."&lt;/p&gt;

And 93.7% of kindergarten students were up to date on all their immunizations, down from 94.1% in the same period the previous year. Data on vaccination rates for first-grade students, which are usually higher, were not yet available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s childhood vaccination rates are still higher than in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. overall&lt;/a&gt;. But public health experts say the declining immunization rate creates two main risks: that measles could spread here amid the deadly outbreak that began in Texas, and that the immunization rate could continue to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/25/magazine/anti-vaccine-movement.html" target="_blank"&gt;worsened trust in public health institutions&lt;/a&gt;, experts say, and there’s growing concern that deep political discord, along with widespread disinformation online, will only make it harder to reverse the downward trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 95% vaccination rate, sometimes called “herd immunity,” is generally considered the gold standard of disease prevention. That threshold not only prevents infections from ripping through a community, but also protects those who are not able to get vaccinated because they are pregnant, immunocompromised or have other serious health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is so infectious,” said Dr. Chad Vercio, division chief of general pediatrics at Loma Linda University Children’s Health in San Bernardino County, where about 93.5% of kindergarten students were immunized against measles last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fewer people are vaccinated against the disease, he said, “the likelihood that someone who’s not been vaccinated gets infected becomes so much higher.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is most often associated with a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-28/first-confirmed-measles-case-in-los-angeles-county-since-2015-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;high fever and rash&lt;/a&gt;, but more severe cases can cause pneumonia or encephalitis. The disease kills about one to three people for every 1,000 infected and leads to hospitalization in 1 in 5 cases, Vercio said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s vaccine laws, which were tightened in the wake of the&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-measles-full-coverage-sg-storygallery.html"&gt; 2014-15 measles outbreak at Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;, make it difficult for parents to send children to school without a series of standard childhood vaccines, including the shots known as DTaP, short for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis; and MMR, short for measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the state’s childhood immunization rates have been falling for the better part of a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vercio said he and other local pediatricians have seen a “significant” increase in vaccine hesitancy since the start of the pandemic, including parents who refuse to discuss immunizations with their doctors after encountering misinformation online about vaccines, including the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-autism-study-vaccine-link-20150421-story.html"&gt;debunked connection between vaccines and autism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, nearly two-thirds of California’s counties reported immunization rates for all childhood diseases below 95%, with 14 counties falling below 90%, according to the health department data. The immunization rate for measles was higher, but 16 counties — or more than 1 in 4 — still reported a rate below 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest immunization rates were in Northern California. In Glenn and El Dorado counties, fewer than 80% of kindergarten and transitional kindergarten students were fully vaccinated, and fewer than 81% against measles. Sutter County reported the lowest vaccination rate overall at 73%, and 75.8% for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southern California has generally fared better. Of the nearly 130,000 kindergarten students in Los Angeles County, more than 97% received two or more doses of the MMR shot last year, the data show. And Orange County reported a 97.4% immunization rate for its nearly 44,000 kindergarten students. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But San Diego County, which has the second-largest number of kindergarten students after L.A. County, saw its immunization rate slip just below the 95% herd immunity benchmark to 94.8%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kern County, the measles immunization rate among more than 19,000 kindergarten students was just shy of 91%, a drop of more than 1 percentage point from the year before, the data show. About 87.4% of kindergarten students had received all their required shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle Corson, a spokeswoman for the Kern County Public Health department, said in a statement that a “mistrust of healthcare providers and systems, along with the spread of vaccine misinformation” has contributed to vaccine hesitancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said some residents also face other barriers in accessing healthcare, including lack of insurance or transportation challenges. Corson said the county has run back-to-school vaccination drives and has a mobile health clinic that travels to more rural areas of the county to provide shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Santa Cruz County, 91.8% of kindergarten students were vaccinated against measles last year, a rate that has declined from 94.1% two years earlier, state data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re vulnerable,” said Dr. Lisa Hernandez, the county’s public health officer. Scenic Santa Cruz has a “baseline vulnerability” to infectious diseases such as measles, she said, because a relatively high number of people travel through the county to take vacations and to visit the University of California campus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many counties with relatively low vaccination rates have a higher share of students in independent study or home-school programs that do not involve classroom instruction or who receive special education services at school even if they’re not fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kern County said 9% of kindergarten students were enrolled in such programs. In El Dorado County, nearly 20% of students were, while in tiny Sutter County, which has the state’s lowest vaccination rate overall, that share surged to nearly 1 in 4 of the county’s kindergarten students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heather Orchard, an immunization specialist and public health nurse with El Dorado County Public Health, said despite the rural county’s low vaccination rates, the risk of a measles outbreak is less likely than in larger, more populated counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like our risk is low in El Dorado County,” she said. But, she said, the county is still working on making vaccines available and sharing that information with families who are sending students to school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California first tightened its childhood vaccination laws a decade ago after a measles outbreak at Disneyland, which spread to 131 people in the state, highlighting the risk of a disease once thought eliminated. California has reported &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;five measles cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, state lawmakers approved &lt;a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277" target="_blank"&gt;Senate Bill 277&lt;/a&gt;, which eliminated parents’ ability to cite their personal or religious beliefs as a reason for skipping childhood vaccinations that were required for school. That law led to a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-vaccine-medical-exemptions-20181029-story.html"&gt;5 percentage point increase&lt;/a&gt; in the state’s vaccination rate, data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years later, amid allegations that a handful of doctors were issuing bogus medical exemptions for unvaccinated children, legislators passed &lt;a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB276" target="_blank"&gt;SB 276&lt;/a&gt;, giving the state &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-09-04/tough-rules-california-vaccine-exemptions-legislature-approves-sb276"&gt;more authority to scrutinize those exemptions&lt;/a&gt;. Those collective efforts reduced personal belief exemptions to zero and medical exemptions to less than 1% statewide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since then, the vaccination rate for all childhood immunizations and for the two-dose measles shot have declined, state data show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former state Sen. Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), a pediatrician who wrote both of California’s vaccine laws, said his efforts have made schools safer for vulnerable kids, even while acknowledging that immunization rates remain low in certain regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a policy point of view, we’ve done what we can,” Pan said. “And I feel that we’ve done well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But public health experts are preparing for childhood immunization rates to continue declining in the current political climate and as the anti-vaccine movement becomes more mainstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now it has started to become much more of this kind of red-state, blue-state thing,” said Richard Carpiano, a public policy professor at the UC Riverside who has studied vaccine hesitancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpiano and other experts said there’s general concern that the Trump administration’s decision to pull funding for public health efforts and medical research will only worsen health disparities across the country. He noted that instead of encouraging families to vaccinate their children during this recent measles outbreak, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Trump’s U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5320352/measles-rfk-west-texas-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;promoted vitamin A and cod liver oil as effective treatments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going backwards. And we’re creating all these different types of vulnerabilities,” Carpiano said. “The lighter fluid has just been thrown all over these little sparks about freedom and personal choice and parental rights.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:27:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQcERteHdfRGNQOE15SUYybnpjNXowbGZMWDk3MUJnZDdXMlB1d1hBSXU4R1c2RVJNMmE4QzNaZlhEbTYxLTBob0pVWjlNQnpDUGt4ZVpGSXpqaFI2bkYyaDNMYTZnaHE5bTk5OEp0enI2T3dfcDBLMWxIb05PdzJfejNOUlhYZ25VZnZtX0F4MjNKSDZ6NjB6TUZWQQ</guid></item><item><title>This Cheese Could Be Better for Your Heart Health, New Study Suggests - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9Vd2RJM01nbkdWUTVfbnhUTndBUXh4ejMtR3JCSzlhM0c2aWthY2ZJbkxvT2ZncElWc1F1dWpPdFF0MDhGTUppdUItV2ZhY29JRG1udTUxUG0zUFRfbzV1Z0pVVzB5UFdGN015c3NDbDhrZGZZNGxPOUF3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-generic" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that pasture-raised, grass-fed cheese may be better for your heart health than other cheeses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study compared Cheddar cheese made with pasture-raised dairy with Cheddar made with dairy from cows raised indoors and fed mixed rations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both groups had lower LDL ("bad") cholesterol levels after six weeks of eating the cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s no secret that we Americans love our cheese. From mozzarella to Cheddar, the average American eats more than 42 pounds of cheese every year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But cheese tends to be loaded with saturated fat, and too much saturated fat has been connected with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/category/4256/heart-healthy-diet-center/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increased LDL (“harmful”) cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease risk—so what is eating so much cheese doing to our health?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Importantly, not all saturated fats are created equal. There are seven primary types of saturated fats in our food, all made of varying lengths—or chains—of carbon atoms. Research suggests that long-chain fatty acids may be more harmful to our health than medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids, which are more likely to have neutral effects on health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, there’s evidence that when cows are grass-fed, their beef contains a better fatty acid profile, featuring more medium- and short-chain fatty acids than cows that have been grain-fed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers in Ireland wanted to know if those improvements to nutritional profile would extend to the dairy grass-fed cows produce, so they conducted an original study and published the results in the &lt;em&gt;International Dairy Journal&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study aimed to investigate whether full-fat Cheddar cheese made with dairy from grass-fed, pasture-based cows would affect markers of cardiometabolic health in overweight, middle-aged adults differently than the same cheese made with dairy from grain-fed cows.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers chose 58 participants for this part of the study, and they were all over 50 years old, with an average age of 59 and a BMI of at least 25 kg/m-2, placing them in the overweight category. Researchers explain that they selected this population because the group is often advised to avoid consuming cheese due to its saturated fat content. Participants had no chronic comorbidities or dairy intolerances, and they all consumed an omnivorous diet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers split participants into two groups, and both groups were given 120 grams of full-fat unmelted Cheddar cheese to eat each day. For six weeks, one group ate pasture-fed Cheddar every day, and the other ate total mixed ration (TMR) Cheddar every day. TMR feeding is a common strategy for feeding indoor herds in the United States, Europe and China. Researchers chose Cheddar cheese because it’s one of the most popular types of cheese in Ireland, where the research was undertaken.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anthropometric data was collected for each participant, including weight, height, BMI, body fat percentage and waist and hip circumference. Other measurements included blood pressure, blood lipids—including cholesterol and triglycerides—and blood glucose (sugar). Participants also completed a food frequency questionnaire at baseline and again at the end of the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As researchers note, 120 grams of cheese each day is more than a recommended serving size of cheese, so the effect of switching to pasture-raised cheese may be much more limited in your own life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers note that the differences between the two groups became less significant after a statistical correction, which may mean the difference is smaller than reported.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study was limited to middle-aged, overweight participants in Dublin and its surrounding areas, so the results might not apply to other populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After statistical analyses were run, participants who ate the pasture-fed cheese for six weeks had lower levels of circulating saturated fatty acids. In addition, total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations decreased in both groups at about the same levels.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a blood cholesterol test, however, the study found little difference between the two groups, and the researchers believe further studies with larger groups of participants should be done.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Heart Association recommends two to three servings of fat-free or low-fat dairy products daily&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But there is some evidence that full-fat dairy, including cheese, may also be &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-fats-for-better-heart-health-8775708" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a healthy and beneficial choice&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fat isn’t the only component in cheese that may affect heart health, though. Eating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-sodium-salt-8606143" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high amounts of sodium&lt;/a&gt; has been linked with high blood pressure, and sodium can be fairly high in some types of cheese. If you need to watch your sodium intake for your blood pressure or if your body tends to be sensitive to it, consider limiting your cheese intake to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7961621/the-best-low-sodium-cheeses-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower-sodium cheeses&lt;/a&gt;, like fresh mozzarella, Swiss, ricotta and mascarpone. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to remember that the amount of cheese the participants in this study ate each day was a large amount—more than 4 ounces per day. One serving of cheese is about 1.5 ounces. If you choose to eat cheese, limit it to a serving or two at a time, depending on how often you eat it.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that eating cheese from pasture-fed cows lowers the amount of saturated fatty acids in the blood when compared to grain-fed dairy. Both pasture-fed and grain-fed cheese appeared to lower LDL and total cholesterol levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating cheese in moderation may not have the negative effects on heart health that scientists have historically believed, especially shorter-chain fatty acids. Until larger, long-term studies have been performed, if you choose to eat full-fat cheese, eat it in moderation. If you need to watch your salt intake, choose lower-sodium cheeses most of the time and use higher-sodium cheese, like Parmesan, more sparingly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for ways to reduce your cholesterol levels, certain &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/288593/10-foods-that-lower-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods can help lower cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, including salmon, oats, nuts, legumes and apples. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8042248/walking-plan-to-lower-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt; has also been shown to improve cholesterol levels. With small changes, you can still have your cheese and eat it, too—and still have healthy cholesterol levels.&lt;br&gt;

One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Most vaccinated adults don't need another vaccine dose, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

"But if you looked at the epidemiology of those outbreaks, it was in people who never got a vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He went on, "So it wasn't that the immunity faded, that the vaccine wasn't good enough. It's an excellent vaccine as a single-dose vaccine. The problem was people didn't get it.

These people would be eligible for re-vaccination with one or two doses, the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So, the first measles vaccine licensed in the U.S. was in 1963 and it was an inactivated vaccine," he told ABC News. "That inactivated vaccine had two consequences to it. One, it did not produce protective immunity and, number two, it led to -- when people did get exposed and infected -- it led to atypical measles, and that can be very severe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Poland said, at the time, there was also a live attenuated measles vaccine, similar to what is used today "but it was not very attenuated or weakened, and so it caused a lot of side effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He explained that to decrease side effects, physicians would give a patient a vaccine and then a shot of immunoglobulin, or antibodies. While this decreased side effects, it also tended to kill the vaccine virus, not giving people adequate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For those who were vaccinated with the single-dose vaccine similar to the one used today -- or received the MMR vaccine -- Offit said another dose is likely not needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In 1989, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended children receive a second MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit and Poland said anyone who has received two doses of the MMR vaccine does not need to receive another dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If someone is unsure if they are immune to measles, they should first try to find their vaccination records.
