For instance, when you’re around someone you love, you will behave very differently than you would around someone you dislike. Likewise, your energy will affect the space around you differently, telling each person you are with someone you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/being-in-love"&gt;Healthline writer Crystal Raypole noted&lt;/a&gt;, “It may not seem like it, but being in love is a somewhat scientific process. Falling in love involves a lot of hormones, which can supercharge your feelings and make them wildly fluctuate. When you’re around the person you love, increases in dopamine and norepinephrine lead to feelings of pleasure, giddiness, nervous excitement, and euphoria.” Because of this, a woman’s energy will change when she’s around the person she loves the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 beautiful ways a woman’s energy changes around the person she loves most:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. She undergoes physical changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-undergoes-physical-changes.png" alt="woman who is undergoing physical changes" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she undergoes physical changes" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Yuganov Konstantin | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first ways that a woman’s energy will change when she’s around the person she loves most is through a change in her physical energy. Things that should be inexplicable, like a faster heartbeat, increased sweating, or shakiness, can be linked to chemical changes in the body. When you’re around the person you love, you don’t stay the same, quite literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor of human ecology at the University of Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/12/love.heart.brain/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Timothy Loving, explained&lt;/a&gt;, “Part of the whole attraction process is strongly linked to physiological arousal as a whole. Typically, that’s going to start with things like increased heart rate, sweatiness, and so on.” Cardiac electrophysiologist &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/12/love.heart.brain/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Reginald Ho added&lt;/a&gt; that a rush of adrenaline makes someone’s heart beat faster when they see the person they love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes occur in a woman’s body when she sees the person she loves the most. These can have a huge impact on her energy and change it in a beautiful way. A woman around the person she loves most will naturally act differently because she has no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/innocent-habits-that-destroy-womans-feminine-energy"&gt;11 Innocent Habits That Destroy A Woman’s Feminine Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. She feels nervous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-feels-nervous.png" alt="woman who feels nervous" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she feels nervous" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way a woman’s energy changes around the person she loves most is that she’ll get a bit nervous. The exact level of anxious energy she feels can differ depending on the person, but there’s a good chance she’ll feel some nerves around the person she loves. While some mistake this nervous energy for a general feeling of anxiety, it’s likely that she feels this way because of the person she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/do-their-nervous-habits-mean-they-like-me-8722041"&gt;VeryWell Mind writer Sian Ferguson explained&lt;/a&gt; that we all engage in nervous habits, but sometimes they can be a sign of something more. “Nervous habits are those little behaviors people tend to do without even realizing it — like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or shifting in their seat. They’re just our natural reactions to feeling uncomfortable or excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/do-their-nervous-habits-mean-they-like-me-8722041"&gt;Hannah Owens, LMSW, said&lt;/a&gt; that exhibiting these habits around the person you love is normal. “Feeling a romantic interest in somebody can be anxiety-inducing — you don’t know if they reciprocate the feelings, and you’re focused on making a good first impression, which can be nerve-wracking,” she said. In other words, a woman bringing some nervous energy to the room when she loves someone is normal and can indicate just how interested she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/beautiful-traits-of-people-who-radiate-good-energy"&gt;11 Beautiful Traits Of People Who Radiate Good Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. She is connected to her partner’s emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-connected-partners-emotions.png" alt="woman who is connected to her partner's emotions" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she is connected to her partner’s emotions" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Rachata Teyparsit | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman in tune with her partner will be connected to their emotions. In fact, she may even absorb those emotions. A woman in love will naturally want to be as close to her partner as possible, even to the point of feeling their same emotions and understanding exactly how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage and family therapist &lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/stop-absorbing-other-peoples-emotions"&gt;Amanda Turecek shared&lt;/a&gt; that this can be particularly prevalent for highly sensitive people (HSP). “Research seems to indicate that certain neurons — mirror neurons — act differently in the brains of HSP than in the brains of non-HSP,” she said. “Mirror neurons kick in to gear in our prefrontal cortex, our area of the brain that also controls things like morality and planning around consequences. They encourage us to imitate others and are more active in the brains of HSPs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, highly sensitive people are more likely to imitate those around them. If a woman is an HSP, she may be more likely to absorb emotions from those around her, especially the person she loves most, as that is likely also who she admires the most. This leads to a deep connection and understanding of feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/phrases-brilliant-people-use-soften-energy-get-what-they-want"&gt;11 Phrases Brilliant People Use To Soften Their Energy To Get What They Want&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. She becomes more nurturing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-becomes-more-nurturing.png" alt="woman who has become more nurturing" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she becomes more nurturing" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Prostock-studio | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman around the person she loves most may become more nurturing. Scientists have often debated whether women are more nurturing and compassionate than men, something Emma Seppala &lt;a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men" rel="nofollow"&gt; in UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seppala noted that women are often measured to have more oxytocin. “Women may at times have higher levels of oxytocin — sometimes called the ‘cuddle hormone’ or ‘love hormone’ because it is linked to bonding, social connection and monogamy,” she said. “It is produced in women during labor and lactation in women and is believed to trigger bonding and nurturing behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether women are more compassionate than men is still debatable, but based on explanations like these, women have plenty of reasons to be nurturing. Even setting levels of oxytocin aside, many women are nurturing around those they love. Being around the one they love most would surely bring out this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/early-clues-someone-energy-pure-poison"&gt;15 Early Clues Someone's Energy Is Pure Poison, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. She changes to become more like her partner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-changes-become-more-like-her-partner.png" alt="woman who changed to become more like her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she changes to become more like her partner" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;AYO Production | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing to become more like your partner isn’t necessarily advisable, as everyone should strive to maintain their own autonomy and be their own person. That being said, many women who are in love will make what are sometimes subtle, difficult-to-notice changes to become more like their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-to-do-life/202109/are-you-becoming-more-like-your-partner"&gt;Marty Nemko, PhD, noted&lt;/a&gt; that becoming more like your partner is completely normal over time. In fact, it would probably be strange not to. He advocates taking inventory of oneself so you can determine whether or not those changes are things you feel like celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, a woman’s energy will likely subtly shift to become closer to that of the person she loves the most. Because she spends so much time around that person and is so interested in them, she will naturally lean into their energy and adapt it for her own purposes. Sometimes these changes will be noticeable, and sometimes they’ll be so small you can’t pick them up without paying close attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/types-of-people-not-worth-your-time-or-energy-according-research"&gt;11 Types Of People That Are Not Worth Your Time Or Energy, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. She is more focused on her partner's wants and needs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-more-focused-partner-what-they-want-need.png" alt="woman who is focused on her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she is more focused on her partner and what they want and need" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Ground Picture | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman loves her partner, she is more in tune with them and what makes them happy. Based on their wants and needs, she will do the things she knows will keep them satisfied. Her energy will change because she will be focused almost solely on her partner, drowning out the noise of the world and keeping her attention where she feels it is most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-at-any-age/202501/why-its-so-important-to-listen-to-your-partner"&gt;Susan Krauss Whitbourne, PhD, ABPP, cited&lt;/a&gt; a study from Florida State University, which found that “mindfulness in relationships is a key component of being able to take the perspective of your partner. This, in turn, makes partners more compassionate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman is focused on her partner, she is more likely to be mindful of them and compassionate towards them. Putting what they want and need before what she wants and needs herself shifts her energy so that it is beautifully centered on her partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-someone-main-character-energy"&gt;7 Harsh Signs Someone Has Main Character Energy And You're Just An Extra, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. She needs to be closer to her partner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-needs-closer-partner.png" alt="woman who needs to be closer to her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she needs to be closer to her partner" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Aleksandr Rybalko | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman is around the person she loves most, she will want to be physically closer to them, making them emotionally closer as well. Doing things like holding hands, hugging, and touching will bring two people closer together. Her energy will change as she feels closer to her partner, and she will feel loved and cherished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An article published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7485933/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Social and Personality Psychology Compass&lt;/a&gt; noted that relationships affect one’s health for good and bad. “Positive aspects of close relationships, such as intimacy and social support, predict better health outcomes, including longer survival following a breast cancer diagnosis, and improved emotional well-being,” researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman feels close to her partner, it will lead to better health outcomes for both. This will give a woman a brighter, lighter energy. As her physical energy changes, so will her emotional and spiritual energy. She will become a light for those around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/subtle-ways-weak-man-drains-powerful-womans-energy-without-her-realizing"&gt;10 Subtle Ways A Weak Man Drains A Powerful Woman’s Energy Without Her Realizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. She and her partner have an unspoken communication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-she-partner-have-unspoken-communication.png" alt="woman who has an unspoken communication with her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she and her partner have an unspoken communication" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages.com - Yuri A | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman around the person she loves most can tell what they’re thinking without speaking. They will have a form of unspoken communication, like a secret language. For them, it just takes a look to know what the other person is thinking. Words are not required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.utpb.edu/about-us/articles/communication/the-influence-of-nonverbal-communication-on-interpersonal-relationships/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The University of Texas Permian Basin said&lt;/a&gt;, “Nonverbal communication can make or break a relationship. A single glance can spark an argument, while a simple touch on the shoulder can mend wounded pride. And sometimes, the sting of words is easier to bear than the weight of crushing silence. There’s power in what goes unspoken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who can communicate with her partner without words will have a different energy around her. She feels more assured both in who she is and in her relationship. This confidence can be powerful and radiates to everyone around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/ways-increase-aura-make-people-instantly-attracted-energy"&gt;11 Ways To Increase Your Aura And Make People Instantly Attracted To Your Energy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. She feels more secure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-feels-more-secure.png" alt="woman who feels secure with her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she feels more secure" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman is in a relationship where she feels safe and secure physically, she’s likely also to feel that way emotionally. Her energy will shift to quiet confidence and competence because she knows she is taken care of and space is being held for her. This will, in turn, give her the freedom to be who she really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/how-do-you-create-emotional-safety-in-your-relationships"&gt;PsychCentral writer Sonya Matejko stated&lt;/a&gt;, “Emotional safety is the foundation for a loving and healthy relationship. It’s about establishing trust with another person and feeling safe enough to be open and vulnerable with them. To put it simply, emotional safety is feeling secure enough to truly express yourself with someone and show up as your most authentic self.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman is around the person she loves most, she will feel physically and emotionally safe. This sense of security will transform her energy into something more confident and ready for anything. Her energy will be stronger, and so will she.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/stoic-techniques-read-peoples-energy"&gt;7 Stoic Techniques To Read People's Energy Easily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.

She won’t be afraid to share how she’s feeling or unpack her baggage because she knows her partner has her back completely. Her energy shifts in a way that makes her more confident and open to sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/why-vulnerability-in-relationships-is-so-important-5193728"&gt;Marriage and family therapist Shari Foos noted&lt;/a&gt;, “Vulnerability is when a person willingly takes the risk to reveal their emotions and weaknesses. This emotional openness is essential in all healthy relationships, as it paves the way for deeper understanding and evokes the empathy necessary for healthy long-term relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman feels she can be vulnerable with the person she loves the most, that vulnerable energy will transfer to her everyday life. She’ll become naturally more open and willing to help others feel safe in doing so as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-someone-energy-vampire-only-drain-you"&gt;6 Signs Someone Is An Energy Vampire Who Will Only Drain You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

Her future will appear more exciting with her partner in the picture, and she will feel better about herself. This excitement will translate into her energy as she lights up the room and the world around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can feel similar to what some call “new relationship energy.” &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/new-relationship-energy-8679124"&gt;Psychotherapist Kristin Papa, LCSW, said&lt;/a&gt;, “New relationship energy usually refers to the intense excitement, euphoria, and almost electrical sensation typically experienced at the beginning of a romantic relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New relationship energy causes excitement that shows in a woman’s energy. The great thing is Papa confirmed this feeling can last well after the “honeymoon phase” is over. A woman truly in love can always feel this excitement about her life and relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-give-off-calming-energy"&gt;8 Good Signs You Give Off Calming Energy, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary-Faith Martinez is a writer with a bachelor’s degree in English and Journalism who covers news, psychology, lifestyle, and human interest topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="midcat-most-popular"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related Stories From YourTango:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="field field--name-field-content-contains-affiliate field--type-boolean field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 02:02:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPOGE1cjdtazZNNUhtVjU0cFc4RDNGMmFZTFJOSEtUYmFReElHUGhjSmctemNRd3E5MzhON1lwSmJ5MGxIakVtazZxSFZnTlRMM1A0cXQ1eDlKbVUyb2ZyY0NXX2VUYXVQaDBWSHJ1THFHd2hVVlN5V1ItWFFnU0RiZE84MHhuYmo1ZnJkeTRhdEpNWndnV2FCQUpvb1c</guid></item><item><title>夏威夷百日咳病例呈上升趋势- Honolulu Star-Advertiser | Hawaii pertussis cases are on the rise - Honolulu Star-Advertiser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQQ1dpUUxoM1o0T0xzSERncmowZHA4a3Y0THpBbHJFSjhnZHZyOTh1UllBcHhhbFBJM2dEaDBZdWM4VHB1Mmpka1pXWndDRjlhb19RcjFaTGl0RnZ3VmszeFdzNlliVFRfNTNBY01mLXBjWUxiS1F6VThTVWYyYTVIUVZWeTlBWVRWM2hOYk9WcEFQVHlWOEpxZ2U0aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-content" class="post col-12 col-md-11 clearfix"&gt;
                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health said cases of pertussis are on the rise in the state, and is urging residents to keep up with recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said, as of May 15, there have been 108 cases of pertussis reported, compared to 84 cases for all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease spread through the air via the coughs or sneezes of an infected person,” said DOH in a news release. “Initially, the symptoms resemble a cold but can progress to intense coughing fits. In children, coughing fits can be followed by a deep breath that makes a whooping sound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health complications from pertussis can be serious and even life-threatening, DOH said, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some potential complications include pneumonia, seizures, apnea (a pause in breathing), encephalopathy (a disease of the brain) and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most effective way to prevent pertussis is through vaccination with either the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccines,” said DOH. “Multiple doses are recommended for infants, children and adults.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, DOH said no further cases of measles have been reported in the state following the two confirmed in early April — one in a &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/hawaii-confirms-travel-related-measles-case-in-child-under-5/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;child under age 5 &lt;/a&gt;and the other in an adult household member — related to international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH has concluded there was no further community spread from those two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are concerned, however, of the growing number of cases on the mainland, which has now surpassed 1,000 across 30 states this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DOH recommends continued vigilance and efforts to increase the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination rate,” said the department. “High vaccination rates protect individuals and communities and prevent cases from becoming outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates for all routinely recommended vaccinations for school entry, including those for measles, pertussis, polio and chickenpox, have declined in Hawaii and nationally since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH strongly recommends that children and adults stay up-to-date with recommended vaccinations to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases. It also encourages residents to discuss concerns about vaccines with a trusted health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Coating bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sleeping under a bed net has been one of the most successful ways of preventing malaria as the main malaria-spreading mosquitoes hunt at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Vaccines to protect children living in high-risk malaria areas are also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nets are both a physical barrier and also contain insecticides which kill mosquitoes that land on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticide in many countries so the chemicals no longer kill the insects as effectively as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We haven't really tried to directly kill parasites in the mosquito before this, because we were just killing the mosquito," says researcher Dr Alexandra Probst, from Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, she says that approach is "no longer cutting it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers analysed malaria's DNA to find possible weak spots while it is infecting mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They took a large library of potential drugs and narrowed it down to a shortlist of 22. These were tested when female mosquitoes were given a blood-meal contaminated with malaria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09039-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In their article in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists describe two highly effective drugs that killed 100% of the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The drugs were tested on material similar to bed nets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Even if that mosquito survives contact with the bed net, the parasites within are killed and so it's still not transmitting malaria," said Dr Probst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think this is a really exciting approach, because it's a totally new way of targeting mosquitoes themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She says the malaria parasite is less likely to become resistant to the drugs as there are billions of them in each infected person, but less than five in each mosquito. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The effect of the drugs lasts for a year on the nets, potentially making it a cheap and long-lasting alternative to insecticide, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This approach has been proven in the laboratory. The next stage is already planned in Ethiopia to see if the anti-malarial bed nets are effective in the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It will take at least six years before all the studies are completed to know if this approach will work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the vision is to have bed nets treated with both anti-malaria drugs and insecticide so that if one approach doesn't work, then the other will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 23:10:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE8ya2U1TUJKeHFRYUI1dEdjdThLY05lU045dDRZOHU5RjlGR1dIWGxpTVNMV1Y2elNMN0J0Ukp5ejdCWUNHU1htN0tpYlZGRmNyTVdiUVE3SEZTd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5vOXY1R1VzeHBzYXhrLXlSdHB5WTdFdGI0b2VJazFmM0xsUlN0c1ZKT0J5VVdMYUxXaGhzT1pITm9oaTRSQkhZQVNUOHFZUDJLMHI1RDZrSDhGQlNEekpF</guid></item><item><title>当局称，被新泽西州宠物杀死的狂犬病臭鼬- NJ.com | Rabid skunk killed by N.J. pet, authorities say - NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPaXpNamFKRXRUdTlXOG5LOVgyc1hrWkJ3WU9id3RmRjk5dGtYVThLLUVyUGYyUG9rMS1uVm81dkMwYVZoY3NteXotWXBpN3JEamV5YXNQbkcwRHJfWUtmVkh5T0tDbFJOaU9oR2JlMmFkNEdvQVduT2Q4X0NrclJ6X0M4ejk5ZG5pV080dNIBoAFBVV95cUxPZ19Mc3VwX3pTdEZnM2l2aU5FbllSa01OTWIwMWtsN19uZ3hvdjlNd2ZXM2d6ZjBhUV8zZXVzV1c1cll6MmZoTTJiV1BtV3ZZb0VXcHI5a0ctTXUwQ2lWeDNOS0dtRUNQODBGLWZzSzBXNUtMT1U5dFFhZEdRajlzanFoZkdRZG12SmZGZkVDUmViSktsRXIwLVU4NWRCSlJi?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FBS4LBUBCZGQLAGJ5QGZYWBM7E"&gt;A skunk that was killed by a dog in South Jersey t&lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/camden/2025/05/rabid-raccoon-killed-by-cops-in-nj-town-officials-say.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nj.com/camden/2025/05/rabid-raccoon-killed-by-cops-in-nj-town-officials-say.html"&gt;ested positive for rabies last week&lt;/a&gt;, officials in Camden County said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FZ776TSSRZC75JVP6MPOWTWIBM"&gt;On May 16, a Cherry Hill resident reported that their dog had killed a skunk in their backyard, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TFCFIO4OVBD47O5HHJDH4ZYALM"&gt;The skunk was sent to the state laboratory for testing and the Camden County Department of Health said Wednesday that the skunk tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GJPGQJGXRRBRTL3BFI3X75WPHQ"&gt;The dog was given a rabies booster shot and will be quarantined for four months, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QJPZYIMCERDHTE47ALVRLOHOV4"&gt;The skunk is the third animal in Camden County that tested positive for rabies since the beginning of April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NROW4USXIZDLPBJAT4GEQL4D3Q"&gt;Police in Oaklyn killed a raccoon suspected to be infected with rabies on April 27, according to county officials.

&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the Sachem School District, 116 students and seven staff members were identified as having had prolonged contact with the infected student, and were offered tests on Monday at the school’s East Campus. Individuals who were tested received TB skin testing administered by the Suffolk County Health Department. Results from those tests typically take 48 hours to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;So far, there have been no additional cases confirmed within the school community, but the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Concerned parents are demanding more information and greater transparency from school and health officials. “What’s being done to ensure the safety of the kids when we, as parents or guardians, send them to school?” asked Janie Gallo, a Farmingville resident and parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Tuberculosis is a potentially serious bacterial infection that typically affects the lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says TB spreads through the air when a person with active TB disease coughs, sneezes or talks. Symptoms may include a persistent cough, chest pain, fatigue and fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;As of now, the New York State Department of Health reports there have been 16 confirmed TB cases in Suffolk County and 18 in neighboring Nassau County this year — numbers that are consistent with last year’s data for the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;

Telomeres are protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age and are associated with chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over four years, those who took vitamin D experienced significantly less telomere shortening, equivalent to nearly three years of delayed aging, compared to those who took a placebo. These findings support vitamin D as a promising intervention to reduce age-related cellular decline, though more research is needed to confirm long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Aging Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin D3 supplementation slowed telomere shortening over 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants retained the equivalent of 3 extra years of telomere health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Effect from Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Omega-3 supplementation did not significantly impact telomere length.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results from the VITAL randomized controlled trial reveal that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten during aging and are linked to the development of certain diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new report, which is published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, is based on data from a VITAL sub-study co-led by researchers at Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia, and supports a promising role in slowing a pathway for biological aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said co-author JoAnn Manson, MD, principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are made of repeating sequences of DNA, or base pairs, that prevent chromosome ends from degrading or fusing with other chromosomes. Telomere shortening is a natural part of aging and is associated with an increased risk of various age-related diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few short-term, small-scale studies have suggested that vitamin D or omega 3 fatty acid supplementation may help support telomeres, but results have been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and omega 3 fatty acid (1 g/day) supplementation that tracked U.S. females aged 55 years and older and males aged 50 years and older for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VITAL Telomere sub-study included 1,054 of these participants, whose telomere length in white blood cells was assessed at baseline and at Year 2 and Year 4.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with taking placebo, taking vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening over four years, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging compared with placebo. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation had no significant effect on telomere length throughout follow-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, PhD, first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Manson, Mass General Brigham authors include Nancy R.

We hypothesized that vitamin D or n-3 FAs supplementation reduce leukocyte telomere length (LTL) attrition overtime by leveraging the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;VITAL is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (2,000 IU/day) and marine n-3 FAs (1 g/day) supplements for 5 years among a representative sample of 25,871 US females ≥55 and males ≥50 years of age. The VITAL Telomere study (NCT04386577) included 1054 participants who were evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTL was determined by the Absolute Human Telomere Length Quantification quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. The pre-specified primary outcome measures were changes in LTL between baseline, Year 2 and Year 4. Analyses of intervention effect used mixed-effects linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTL was measured in a total of 2,571 samples from the 1031 participants at baseline, year 2, and year 4. Compared to placebo, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation significantly decreased LTL attrition by 0.14 kilo base pairs (kb) (0.01, 0.27) over 4 years (p = 0.039).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall trend analysis showed that the vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation group had LTLs that were about 0.035 kb higher per year of follow-up compared to placebo group (0.002, 0.07, p=0.037). Marine n-3 FAs supplementation had no significant effect on LTL at either year 2 or year 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;4-years of supplementation with 2000 IU/day vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reduced telomere attrition by 140 bp, suggesting that vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; daily supplementation with or without n-3 FAs might have a role in counteracting telomere erosion or cell senescence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:57:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBCU3lpcUVYLUxNYm5nR0hPUC04aHBISllxNGZqY1dTOWJ0aFZKR0hYRElydzBoUU1HdnlJVXVhZVB6aXZMQ3daQ1BRQnlWQlpLaGpPUWQ5NzFuOGtiOTcyTU9MRWVGSG5GQnhXdEV3</guid></item><item><title>FDA扩大新冠肺炎疫苗接种的心脏风险警告- Axios | FDA expands warnings of heart risks on COVID shots - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFBmeEROOXAta2xKVURtaTN4NG1oaUxsNWh1LWt4MXJwSTBLTmR4V3EwdVIzUzBzSVV5R1RFZGtNNWNVbEcwVm9IYzNTMG1HUDV4YWoyRnJ0R0hQMHVnOXNEd2d1b3dodTVzcUNfbg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:42:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBmeEROOXAta2xKVURtaTN4NG1oaUxsNWh1LWt4MXJwSTBLTmR4V3EwdVIzUzBzSVV5R1RFZGtNNWNVbEcwVm9IYzNTMG1HUDV4YWoyRnJ0R0hQMHVnOXNEd2d1b3dodTVzcUNfbg</guid></item><item><title>与儿童推理技能相关的微小大脑褶皱-神经科学新闻 | Tiny Brain Folds Linked to Reasoning Skills in Children - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE02dlhmYi1qNFpydTRBR3hNczhvWUx4WHJCLTdxS3RBVVE0SWV4akdiQkxnRnlqZFlrWmlaRHUtREVBa1V0WGpRN0NCSUJWSEd5bnF2WkluTHRCaW5Cd0JnYms2YTAyZVRNZVpIMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that small, shallow grooves in the human brain—called tertiary sulci—are closely tied to reasoning ability and brain connectivity in children and adolescents. These uniquely human folds appear to bring critical brain regions closer together, enhancing communication and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an fMRI study, deeper tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices were linked to stronger connections and better reasoning performance.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published May 19 in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, University of California, Berkeley, researchers show that in children and adolescents, the depths of some small grooves are correlated with increased connectivity between regions of the brain — the lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex — involved in reasoning and other high-level cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grooves may actually bring those areas closer together in space, shortening the connections between them and speeding communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication, the researchers say, is that variability in these small grooves, which are called tertiary sulci (pronounced sul’-sigh), may help explain individual differences in cognitive performance, and could serve as diagnostic indicators or biomarkers of reasoning ability or neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The impetus for this study was having seen that sulcal depth correlated with reasoning across children and adolescents,” said Silvia Bunge, professor of psychology and a member of UC Berkeley’s Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (HWNI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given our previous findings, our former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Häkkinen aimed to test if sulcal depth was correlated with reasoning performance and to test if patterns of coordinated activity within a lateral prefrontal-parietal network could explain this relation between sulcal depth and reasoning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had explicit predictions about which tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex would be functionally connected to tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, and that panned out,” added Kevin Weiner, UC Berkeley associate professor of psychology and of neuroscience and a member of HWNI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prefrontal and parietal cortices aside, the hypothesis is that the formation of sulci leads to shortened distances between connected brain regions, which could lead to increased neural efficiency, and then, in turn, individual differences in improved cognition with translational applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cortex is sort of haphazardly crunched up into the brain — that’s what I was always taught,” Bunge said. “Kevin came along and changed my mind about sulci.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hills and valleys of the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of most animals, mammals included, have smooth surfaces. Primates have hills and valleys covering their cerebral cortex. While one group of primates, the New World monkeys called marmosets, have shallow, barely perceptible sulci, those of humans are deeply incised, with between 60% and 70% of the cortex buried in these folds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortical folding patterns in humans also change with age, establishing their final structure late in prenatal development while becoming less prominent in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While sulci can change over development, getting deeper or shallower and developing thinner or thicker gray matter — probably in ways that depend on experience — our particular configuration of sulci is a stable individual difference: their size, shape, location and even, for a few sulci, whether they’re present or absent,” said Bunge, who studies abstract reasoning in young people, from 6 years of age through young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smallest grooves, many of which are uniquely human, are called tertiary sulci because they appear last in prenatal development and are never as deep as the major or primary sulci that are most evident on the cerebral surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have speculated that the tertiary sulci emerge in parts of the human brain that have expanded the most throughout evolution and have a protracted development, and that they are likely associated with aspects of cognition — reasoning, decision-making, planning and self-control — that develop over a protracted adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prior to this study, evidence was lacking for a connection between tertiary sulci and brain connectivity. The UC Berkeley study is one of few, all within the past few years, to provide such proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sulci linked to cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner and Bunge said that, as undergraduates, they were never taught how to define tertiary sulci; they often examined scans of average brains that did not match any specific individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner noticed this mismatch as an undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the time, all I knew was that I had some cortical squiggles that weren’t in the average brain atlases that we had in the lab. So the question I asked my mentors, Sabine Kastner and Charlie Gross, was: Do I have different structures that aren’t in our atlases or are structures missing from these atlases?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That sent me down a 15-year rabbit hole studying one particular tertiary sulcus in the visual cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work showed that a specific sulcus, the mid-fusiform sulcus, varied in length from as small as 3 millimeters to as long as 7 centimeters in any given person. Moreover, the longer the sulcus, the better a person was at processing and recognizing human faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“About 2% of individuals have developmental prosopagnosia, which means they can’t perceive faces, and they don’t have any brain damage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That sulcus, especially in the right hemisphere, is shorter and shallower in those folks than in what we refer to as neurotypical controls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on that rabbit hole, Bunge and Weiner wondered whether tertiary sulci in other regions of the brain, outside the visual processing units, also correlated with cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon moving to UC Berkeley in 2018, Weiner began investigating the prefrontal cortex — located in the front of the brain behind the forehead — in collaboration with Bunge, who wanted to test whether sulci in this area would be linked to reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 paper, the two collaborated to define all the smaller sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex and created a computer model that identified the tertiary sulci as contributing the most variation in reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The model identified that there’s tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex that are contributing to reasoning skills in kids,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding on that work in the new study, Weiner, Bunge and their colleagues painstakingly catalogued the tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, located under and just behind the crown of the skull, and investigated its functional connections with the sulci of the lateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both studies, they studied 43 participants, 20 of them female, who ranged in age from 7 to 18. While in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, the participants were given a reasoning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the brain activity in 21 sulci they had identified in each hemisphere of the brain, and the functional connections between these sulci — including, for the first time, tertiary sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these individuals, greater depth for several of the sulci implicated in reasoning was associated with higher network centrality across the set of prefrontal and parietal sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience affects sulci&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bunge pointed out that the association between depths of sulci and reasoning does not hold for all sulci, and that sulcal depth may change with experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do we think that an individual’s capacity for reasoning is set in stone based on their cortical folding? No!,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive function depends on variability in a variety of anatomical and functional features and, importantly, we know that experience, like quality of schooling, plays a powerful role in shaping an individual’s cognitive trajectory, and that it is malleable, even in adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner’s lab is creating a computer program to help researchers identify tertiary sulci in the human brain. Most programs only identify about 35 sulci, but when tertiary sulci are included, there are over 100, he said, including new ones that their labs have uncovered together. They argue that sulci could serve as landmarks to compare brains between individuals, since brains vary so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dozens of brain maps have been proposed in just the last five years, but they disagree about the areas of associated regions in the cortex, and there are mismatches between areas at the group and individual level,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Examining network architecture based on individual sulcal morphology circumvents these disagreements and mismatches, with the opportunity to glean network-level insight from the local sulcal anatomy that is specific to a given individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Bunge and Weiner, other UC Berkeley co-authors of the paper are former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Häkkinen, former graduate student Willa Voorhies, former undergraduates Ethan Willbrand and Jewelia Yao, and former visiting scholars Yi-Heng Tsai and Thomas Gagnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R21HD100858) and the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH133637), and the National Science Foundation (CAREER Award 2042251).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bac8d6c9dbd4dedfc8c9fad8dfc8d1dfd6dfc394dfdecf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert Sanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Sanders – UC Berkeley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0726-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning&lt;/a&gt;” by Silvia Bunge et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A salient neuroanatomical feature of the human brain is its pronounced cortical folding, and there is mounting evidence that sulcal morphology is relevant to functional brain architecture and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our understanding of the relationships between sulcal anatomy, brain activity, and behavior is still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously found that the depth of three small, shallow sulci in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was linked to reasoning performance during development (Voorhies et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings beg the question: what is the linking mechanism between sulcal morphology and cognition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigated functional connectivity among sulci in LPFC and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) in participants from the same sample as our previous study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We leveraged manual parcellations (21 sulci/hemisphere, total of 1806) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data from a reasoning task from 43 participants aged 7–18 years (20 female). We conducted clustering and classification analyses of individual-level functional connectivity among sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, we found that 1) the connectivity patterns of individual sulci could be differentiated – and more accurately than rotated sulcal labels equated for size and shape; 2) sulcal connectivity did not consistently correspond with that of probabilistic labels or large-scale networks; 3) sulci clustered together into groups with similar patterns, not dictated by spatial proximity; and 4) across individuals, greater depth was associated with higher network centrality for several sulci under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results illustrate how sulcal morphology can be relevant for functional connectivity, and provide proof of concept that using sulci to define an individual coordinate space for functional connectomes is a promising future direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:38:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE02dlhmYi1qNFpydTRBR3hNczhvWUx4WHJCLTdxS3RBVVE0SWV4akdiQkxnRnlqZFlrWmlaRHUtREVBa1V0WGpRN0NCSUJWSEd5bnF2WkluTHRCaW5Cd0JnYms2YTAyZVRNZVpIMA</guid></item><item><title>这种形式的中年痴呆症经常被误认为是抑郁症。现在，医生终于有了答案- AOL.com | This Form Of Midlife Dementia Is Often Mistaken For Depression.

Here’s what the study found, plus what neurologists want you to know about early-onset dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://memory.ucsf.edu/people/rowan-saloner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rowan Saloner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rowan Saloner&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is a study co-author and professor in the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center; &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, is a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43587-025-00878-2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64841303%2Fmidlife-dementia-signs-biomarkers-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Aging;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed more than 4,000 proteins in spinal tap fluid from 116 patients with frontotemporal dementia. The researchers compared those proteins to ones from 39 of the patients’ healthy relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that patients with frontotemporal dementia had changes in the proteins that suggest they have problems with RNA regulation, which is required for the correct gene expression in the brain. (Gene expression can impact how your brain works.) These patients also had certain changes that impacted connections in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins could be the first markers for frontotemporal dementia that surface when people develop the disease, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are these proteins so important&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons. First, "frontotemporal dementia can be caused by several very different types of brain pathology, making it very difficult to provide an accurate diagnosis to patients,” explains &lt;a href="https://memory.ucsf.edu/people/rowan-saloner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rowan Saloner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rowan Saloner&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, study co-author and professor in the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. “Right now, we have no way to tell which pathology someone has while they’re alive, especially in non-inherited cases, which make up the majority of frontotemporal dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by IDing changes in spinal fluid protein, doctors can detect the disease and track its progression. “That will hopefully lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments,” Saloner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s crucial, given that this form of dementia tends to be missed early on, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. But genetic testing could help give patients and their doctors a better sense of what might be behind their symptoms, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind: This study focused on people with an inherited or genetic form of frontotemporal dementia. “We do not know if genetic frontotemporal dementia and sporadic frontotemporal dementia just look the same in the end but have different paths to development,” says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “If they have different paths, then this study has helped us learn about genetic frontotemporal dementia. That is useful but not as broadly applicable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know about early-onset dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-onset dementias like frontotemporal dementia usually impact people in their 40s or 50s, Saloner says. “They can be difficult to diagnose, as early symptoms are often misattributed to stress or psychiatric disorders,” he says. “Compared to Alzheimer’s disease, which now has biomarkers and FDA-approved treatments, frontotemporal dementia remains behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segil says that early-onset dementia should be considered “if someone loses the ability to talk or express themselves and other neurological conditions like a stroke, seizure, or infection have been ruled out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Sachdev says that more information is better with the disease. “It is important to know as much as possible about how these diseases arise,” he says. “It gives us something to work from in everyone else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:27:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5EQ1ByUkx0dnhDemloUmlDb0lRVk9HdllIejVtWVdLYmpveWtiRDhWZ1A1ZXc3T3BYNDJTMEtqNnA5MXFMVi1wcUcwUkxIejZvLUYyRDJPTzNVRDROREs2V3U5OUpRdGVnUm1sTGMxZW5FQWZ6UHQyYkRiMA</guid></item><item><title>“我是一名肿瘤学家，这是我为预防癌症而在每顿饭中添加的食物” -雅虎 | 'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Food I Add to Every Meal for Cancer Prevention' - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPcUxMRTdPY3F2dVpxSUtaYWY2Q3VLWVBsa1Q0YVRPRzV5LTJNLXRWdk40QVlQRFA4QXZYRlVWTTRqVjJVREIxeWdqYUJTMmlZZkVVSjlvSVhmSjVvWmRfbVJHZ0JpU3E4RXdoS1RMdWZDZzd5R3FOd2NHWkRZS05PQg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/preventing-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;According to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, between 30% and 50% of cancer cases are preventable by having healthy diet and lifestyle habits in place.

These tiny powerhouses can lower chronic inflammation, protect your cells and even help regulate blood sugar and cholesterol,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/im-oncologist-dinner-swear-cancer-232500844.html" data-ylk="slk:'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Dinner I Swear By for Cancer Prevention';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Dinner I Swear By for Cancer Prevention'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What To Avoid Eating if You Want To Lower Your Risk of Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All three doctors emphasize that it isn’t only what you eat that’s important when it comes to using diet to lower your risk of cancer; what you don’t eat is important too. They all say they minimize foods with excess sugar or anything ultra-processed. They also recommend minimizing alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I live by the philosophy that every bite is a choice to fuel health or feed disease. That’s why I stick to a whole food, plant-only diet—no ultra-processed foods, no animal protein. Just vibrant, nourishing real plant food. As a 25-year stage IV cancer survivor, heart transplant recipient and marathon runner, I don’t take my energy or health for granted. My food choices are how I show up for this miraculous life,” explains Dr. Mussallem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, Dr. Mussallem says this doesn’t mean eating only nutrient-rich foods all the time; food is about enjoyment too! “I always tell my patients: Aim to eat nearly perfectly at home. That way, when you're out and about, you can make thoughtful choices without guilt or stress,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is such an abundance of polyphenol-containing plant-based foods that it’s easy to incorporate at least one into every single meal. As you prepare your meals, brainstorm ways you can add more plants to your plate. That way, you can lower your risk of cancer with every single bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/people-showering-wrong-order-dermatologists-175000590.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: People Are Showering in the Wrong Order, Dermatologists Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: People Are Showering in the Wrong Order, Dermatologists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPcUxMRTdPY3F2dVpxSUtaYWY2Q3VLWVBsa1Q0YVRPRzV5LTJNLXRWdk40QVlQRFA4QXZYRlVWTTRqVjJVREIxeWdqYUJTMmlZZkVVSjlvSVhmSjVvWmRfbVJHZ0JpU3E4RXdoS1RMdWZDZzd5R3FOd2NHWkRZS05PQg</guid></item><item><title>研究：食物中与白血病生长相关的常见成分- RochesterFirst | Study: Common ingredient in food linked to leukemia growth - RochesterFirst</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOeGtNaW4wcEFJc0pJVUVKTkRHaWUxMlNSVGF3RDNRekJkRFlGbkV0VTJtS2VFc21nY3ExM2t6LUxXb1AzRzE2UGNzNzJseUNZWW02OVlQVndkX2xDWGlBX1FKT2RxNU9HWFkyeEVGamVZTmRudjA3OUZmSURaN3k0bDBiX1ZJaFlHWlhPcGwxbUloR0lvejBSYXJiTENOS0VuZXVJ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE9YSXVPelBBbm9vLU12dWRZTWM4MHRmNXJMS2p1aktodDl1d0hHcXU0Ulh5ejhXLVVtd1ZXeGVxREowbWN3cDc5eHNvRUZQTW1BYV92VVhVWmd6UjlMOGFlM1VqTEdRUHQwWmRsbDB6QklvVmNPa3BFNEF6MnI0Yk9IakxzRTFKcGRwY1JkSDFxVVBLRll4ZGl0YlhhVFZkcmNoaWJBV1MtWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

While the tour may look a lot like Beyoncé’s Renaissance one, the singer has kept fans entertained by bringing out her nanny (of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/01/shakira-gerard-pique-jam.html"&gt;strawberry-jam cheating-scandal fame&lt;/a&gt;), singing all the deep cuts, and shaking her hips … truthfully. But as of this week, one small hiccup has emerged. On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/potential-measles-exposure-shakira-concert-metlife-rcna208216"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250520a.shtml"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; about a potential &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-worried-should-we-be-about-measles-outbreak-spreading.html"&gt;measles exposure&lt;/a&gt; to the tens of thousands of concertgoers who schlepped across state lines to see the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer. According to a press release, the alert stems from one non–New Jersey resident who attended the concert while actively infected with measles. The NJ DOH did not specify what section the individual was seated in but is encouraging everyone who was present at Thursday night’s event to call a health-care provider regarding next steps. Officials say anyone who was exposed could start showing symptoms as late as June 6.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmaybimni001i3b77ow6av1e0@published" data-word-count="131"&gt;The potential New Jersey &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/potential-measles-exposure-shakira-concert-metlife-rcna208216"&gt;exposure&lt;/a&gt; is the latest in a series of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/anti-vaxxers-upset-rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine.html"&gt;outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; across the country, one of which resulted in the death of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/unvaccinated-child-died-measles-west-texas.html"&gt;an unvaccinated child&lt;/a&gt; in Texas earlier this year. The most effective way to protect against the virus is with the MMR vaccine — a two-part dose that treats measles, mumps, and rubella. But with misinformation about vaccines on the rise, and with anti-vax evangelist &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/anti-vaxxers-upset-rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine.html"&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt; serving as Trump’s Health secretary, the country has &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/05/09/measles-cases-2025-states-outbreak-map/83371830007/"&gt;surpassed&lt;/a&gt; more than 1,000 confirmed measles cases this year alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that means we’re shaping up for the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_4-map-of-measles-cases-in-2024-2025"&gt;largest outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in nearly 25 years — scary enough to get RFK Jr. to &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;admit&lt;/a&gt; that, actually, people should get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who has not been fully vaccinated or has not had measles in the past is suspected to be at risk. And for her own sake, let’s hope Shakira got her MMR vaccine: She’s got a world tour to finish up, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re dying for that glow — one can of carrots at a time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/20/lifestyle/men-are-wearing-dangerous-soccer-cleats-as-a-fashion-trend/"&gt;new TikTok trend&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;carrotmaxxing&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; is taking root among beauty-obsessed users looking to score a sun-kissed sheen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of bronzed bliss, some people are turning orange — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/29/lifestyle/what-is-face-basting-how-diaper-rash-cream-can-relieve-dry-skin/"&gt;or worse,&lt;/a&gt; landing themselves in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fake tan has become too expensive. Time to start carrotmaxxing,” one user, @SydneyPacce, declared on &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1921008445269910008"&gt;X (formerly Twitter) &lt;/a&gt;on May 9 alongside a photo of six cans of sliced carrots and a bottle of Dr. Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nine days — and an apparent veggie binge — later, she posted an &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1924281142892523721"&gt;alarming update&lt;/a&gt;: “UPDATE: CARROTMAXXING SENT ME TO THE ER.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The beta-carotene-packed trend supposedly delivers a natural tan by turning skin a warmer hue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you go too hard on the carrots, you might wind up with carotenemia — a rather harmless condition that literally turns your skin yellow-orange due to “high levels of beta-carotene in the blood,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/carotenemia-7254408" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Very Well Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Instead of glowing up, some carrotmaxxers are turning traffic-cone orange — or winding up in the ER. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok/@notsyrianpsycho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having your skin turn a different color is one thing — but getting sent to the ER for sodium overload from the root vegetable is another. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that the high levels of sodium in canned carrots — the way many are partaking in this trend — can cause some serious harm. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Medical School physicians, who wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-failure-and-salt-the-great-debate-2018121815563"&gt;recent statement&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s also highly likely that some patients are more salt-sensitive than others. Thus, directing salt restriction to those most vulnerable might be better than a one-size-fits-all approach.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was apparently the case for @SydneyPacce, who consumed six cans of sliced carrots daily — not raw carrots, mind you — amounting to over 5,250 milligrams of sodium a day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For those partaking in this trend by eating canned carrots — experts warn that the sodium in this pantry item could cause some serious harm.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok/@kainoalam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s more than double the American Heart Association’s &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day"&gt;recommended limit&lt;/a&gt; of 2,300 mg, and way beyond the ideal cap of 1,500 mg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I already had heart problems, so all the sodium in the carrots kinda took me out and I went into mild organ failure,” she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1924654038773035064"&gt;follow-up tweet&lt;/a&gt; on May 19. “I’m doing much better now though!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carrots themselves aren’t the enemy — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/15/health/drinking-this-beverage-could-benefit-people-with-cancer-or-diabetes-study/"&gt;far from it&lt;/a&gt;. Packed with fiber, vitamin K, calcium and vision-boosting antioxidants, they’re a powerhouse snack when eaten in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;People who want to partake in this trend need to tread lightly.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;markobe – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Since they are known for benefiting eye health and vision, carrots are thought to be loaded with vitamin A, but they actually don’t have any vitamin A in its active form,” said Rosy Rojas, a dietetic intern at Tufts’ Frances Stern Nutrition Center.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Instead, carrots are filled with carotenoids, mainly beta-carotene, that can be converted to active vitamin A. Our body is able to regulate this conversion, so toxicity is not an issue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when paired with sodium-laced canned veggies and a desperate quest for clout, the risks grow, as &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/carrotmaxxing-tiktok-trend-carrots-health-warning-b2754963.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by The Independent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the glow-up might be the goal, the carrot craze is proving to be less of a bronzed beauty hack — and more of a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because when it comes to carrotmaxxing, too much of a good thing can leave you cooked.&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers found that total fat and sodium per serving increased by roughly one-third over that period. Sugar content rose by nearly 11%, with "a single serving exceeding 45% of the American Heart Association's daily recommended [added sugar] limit for children."&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The study also found that while protein content averaged 1.97 grams per serving between 2010 and 2020, it "decreased significantly" to 1.69 grams in 2023. Dietary fiber held steady before 2021 but then decreased from 3.82 grams in 2021 to 2.94 grams in 2023. The findings are particularly notable given that ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are "the most commonly consumed food product among children aged 5 to 12," reports the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/health/cereal-nutrients-unhealthy.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; per USDA data. About a third of American children eat cereal each morning, while only 10% of kids start their day with eggs. &lt;a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nutritional-value-of-kids-cereals-declines-despite-industry-awareness-052125.html"&gt;Consumer Affairs&lt;/a&gt; notes that "though the study only examined new product launches—and not the full cereal market—it offers critical insight into where the industry may be heading."

&lt;p&gt;Then, one day later, the rats were shown the same image and treated with an electric shock until they learned to connect the image with pain. Finally, the team tested if the rats would freeze in fear in response to the sound. The “unpaired” group didn’t. The rats in the “paired” group did—it turned out human-like complex emotional models were present in rats as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Johansen and Gu confirmed the capacity was there, they got busy figuring out how it worked exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Behaviorally, we measured freezing responses to the directly paired stimulus, which was the image, and inferred stimulus which was the sound,” Johansen says. “But we also performed something we called miniscope calcium imaging.” The trick relied on injecting rats with a virus that forced their cells to produce proteins that fluoresce in response to increased levels of calcium in the cells. Increased levels of calcium are the telltale sign of activity in neurons, meaning the team could see in real time which neurons in rats’ brains lit up during the experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the region crucial for building these complex emotional models was not the amygdala, but the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which had a rather specialized role. “The dmPFC does not form the sensory model of the world. It only cares about things when they have emotional relevance,” Johansen explains. He said there wasn’t much change in neuronal activity during the sensory learning phase, when the animals were watching the image and listening to the sound. The neurons became significantly more active when the rats received the electric shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “unpaired” group, the active neurons that held the representations of the electric shock and the image started to overlap. In the “paired” group, this overlap also included the neuronal representation of the sound. “There was a kind of an associative bundle that formed,” Johansen says.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Published Wednesday in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.05.003"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, the research saw 1,031 adults either take 2,000 IU of vitamin D every day or a placebo for four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using blood samples, the team measured the length of each person's telomeres, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14171589/lifting-weights-help-reduce-biological-age.html"&gt;repeating sequences of DNA&lt;/a&gt; that protect chromosomes from damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Telomeres shorten with age, and previous research shows people with longer telomeres have a longer life expectancy than those with shorter ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found telomeres were up to eight times longer in people who took daily vitamin D supplements than those in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear exactly how vitamin D lengthens telomeres, experts believe it could help reduce the risk of DNA-damaging oxidative stress and promote the release of enzymes thought to make telomeres longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood tests measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL), the length of telomeres in white blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shorter LTL has been linked to an increased risk of age-related diseases like heart disease and cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the placebo group, LTL decreased 12 percent after two years from the baseline and another 16 percent two years after that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, those who took vitamin D had just five percent less LTL after two years and two percent less two years after that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts estimate the group that took vitamin D prevented the equivalent of three years of aging compared to the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haidong Zhu, first study author and molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, said: 'Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Telomeres, pictured here, are thought to protect chromosomes from damage. Shorter telomeres have been associated with shorter lifespans (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact mechanism is unclear, the researchers suggested vitamin D could create higher levels of telomerase, an enzyme that makes telomeres longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, vitamin D helps lower oxidative stress, an imbalance between disease-fighting antioxidants and harmful free radicals, which attack cells and tissues. Oxidative stress has been shown to damage DNA, potentially shortening telomeres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most experts recommend consuming about 600 to 800 IU per day, significantly less than the 2,000 IU used in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most vitamin D supplements contain between 1,000 and 2,000 IU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consuming more than 4,000 IU in a day could lead to a dangerous buildup of calcium in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because vitamin D normally helps the body absorb more calcium, which is crucial for maintaining bone and muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess vitamin D causes the body to absorb more calcium than it needs, causing it to accumulate in the bloodstream and then get deposited into tissues in the kidneys, lungs and heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to nausea, vomiting, constipation, dehydration, bone pain and kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including the lack of diversity in the sample size, as most participants were white. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was partly funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you find running intimidating, know that there is another way to get some fresh air while doing a reasonably intense workout. It’s called interval walking training (IWT), or sometimes  "Japanese walking" or "3x3 walking." It’s a form of HIIT, but it won’t end in you collapsing on the floor, hating your life. Here’s how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-do-the-3x3-japanese-walking-workout"&gt;How to do the 3x3 "Japanese walking" workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original protocol for this exercise, as published &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/reader/148769277?utm_source=linkout" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 by Hiroshi Nose’s team at Shinshu University in Japan, used a lab test to help people determine how fast they should walk during the workout. Since that’s not practical for most of us, a common substitute is to use perceived effort. During the high intensity portions, you walk a strong, fast pace—about as fast as you can without jogging, and without getting too tired. For the low intensity portions, you walk normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the protocol. It’s simple, and it doesn’t require a warmup, so you can just jump right in: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk for three minutes at a normal speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk for three minutes at high intensity (as fast as you reasonably can).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat those two steps for 30 minutes or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To time those intervals, you can program any smartwatch to beep at three-minute intervals, or just use your phone. I like the free &lt;a href="https://intervalspro.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intervals Pro app&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on my iPhone; try &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.dreamspark.intervaltimer&amp;amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Interval Timer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Android. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2007 study, older adults who did this workout four or more times per week, for five months, ended the study with better aerobic fitness and leg strength than when they started. If you’ve ever wondered &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/does-walking-really-count-as-cardio-1846965965" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;whether walking counts as exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this certainly does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-interval-walking-is-the-new-hiit"&gt;Why interval walking is the new HIIT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking is starting to become more popular.

I see a few forces at work here. First, there’s a lot of over-the-top, go-get-em attitudes in the fitness world, especially on social media. If you’ve been through a few rounds of HIIT hype, you may be sick of trying to push yourself harder and harder (or you were so intimidated by the idea that you never tried.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Explainers" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-cloak x-data="{ commentsCount: null, hasComments: false }" x-init="commentsCount = await window.openweb.getMessagesCount(01JVSYZS86PA2S1K4FHQRCM9TV);

        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash to high intensity fitness can go a bit too far the other way, telling people (often &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/truth-about-cortisol-influencers-blame-for-everything" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;women who have been told to worry about their cortisol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that they don’t need to lift weights or work hard in the gym; they can just go for walks and do some gentle yoga or Pilates. Take that advice seriously enough, and you won’t end up getting much exercise at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking occupies a place in the middle—harder than a hot girl walk or &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/tiktok-s-cozy-cardio-trend-might-help-you-enjoy-exerc-1850811679" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cozy cardio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but easier (and more fun!) than a &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-the-12-3-30-workout-gets-wrong-and-what-it-gets-r-1848667798" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;12-3-30&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; treadmill trudge. Interval walking is especially accessible to people who don’t have a gym membership or fitnessy clothes: All you need is a pair of shoes that are comfortable to walk in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s where I think the real magic of walking comes in: It stops you from overthinking your fitness routine, and lets you just get started. You won’t be tempted to overthink about &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-running-shoes-for-men-women" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;running shoes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/the-best-fitness-watches-for-runners" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fitness watches&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—you just get out there and walk. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;

                A blood test called a PSA can help screen men for prostate cancer but it can also lead to unnecessary treatment.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;News that former President Joseph Biden has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/18/g-s1-67544/joe-biden-prostate-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;advanced prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of a blood test that screens for the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774093/" target="_blank"&gt;most commonly diagnosed cancer among men&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/psa-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;Prostate-specific antigen&lt;/a&gt;, or PSA, screening tests are an imperfect tool for detecting prostate cancer, doctors and public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is identifying and treating aggressive cancers like Biden's while not unnecessarily treating men with slow-growing cancers unlikely to sicken them. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4485977/" target="_blank"&gt;Autopsies found&lt;/a&gt; the disease to be so widespread that more than one-third of white men and half of Black men in their 70s had prostate cancers that would never do any harm.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"PSA testing alone leaves a lot to be desired as a cancer screening test," said radiation oncologist Dr. Brent Rose, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by normal as well as malignant prostate gland cells, in the blood. Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. It also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects, including impotence, incontinence and bowel dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"PSA screening is beneficial," Rose said. "There are risks, though, and so it is a personal decision whether or not to do PSA screening."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is to target and treat aggressive cancers while waiting and watching cancers that might never become troublesome, Rose and other oncologists told NPR. Physicians have been walking this tightrope since they began regularly using PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer in healthy men in the 1990s. There is no other test that effectively screens for prostate cancer — the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;second deadliest cancer&lt;/a&gt; for American men, oncologists said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A history of conflicting guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Attempts to balance the possible harms against the number of lives saved have led to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774093/" target="_blank"&gt;two decades of fluctuating&lt;/a&gt; – and confusing – public health guidelines on PSA screening. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advised against any screening, only to issue a watered-down recommendation in 2018 that men ages 55 to 69 discuss screening with their health care providers. Various physicians' groups offer conflicting guidance for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In its advice to older men, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has been somewhat more consistent. In 2008, the independent panel of national experts recommended men 75 and older not be screened, and since 2018, the panel has advised against screening men 70 and older.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Biden, 82, apparently followed the guidance. He last had a PSA screening test in 2014, when he was 71 or 72 years old, a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403887/trump-biden-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;spokesman said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For men between the ages of 55 and 69, the task force &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prostate-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; talking to their health care providers about their preferences before deciding whether to get a PSA test. It classifies the recommendation as Grade C, which means it offers only a small benefit and insurers may not cover it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finding the time to have a conversation about a topic as complicated as the value of prostate-cancer screening can be challenging for most primary-care physicians, oncologists interviewed for this story said. And while some men might welcome what's called "shared decision-making," others find it agonizing. Still, the only advice for men for now is to talk the issue over carefully with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The case for the PSA test&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, recognizes the problem and hopes that the task force will address it in new guidelines, which it is currently drafting. In August, she met with the volunteer panel in her role as chair of the medical advisory board for the advocacy group Zero Prostate Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morgans believes the current guidance was based on a flawed clinical trial. It concluded that men screened with PSA tests were no less likely to die of prostate cancer than men assigned to a group that was not screened. But the results were muddied because nearly 90% of the men in the control group had at least one PSA test before or during the trial, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morgans would like to see the recommendation beefed up so more men get screened for prostate cancer and Black men and men with a family history, who are more vulnerable get screened earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I take care of people who have very advanced prostate cancer, as well as some people who have curable prostate cancer," she said, "so my perspective is really skewed by the fact that I really want to make that diagnosis when things are curable."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So does Dr. Matthew Cooperberg, a urologic oncologist and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. He has pushed to rename early-stage prostate cancer in part to ease the stress of a cancer diagnosis. One possible name, "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39350309/" target="_blank"&gt;acinar neoplasm&lt;/a&gt;," describes an abnormal growth but one lacking the potential to spread or kill. Cooperberg also advocates monitoring men with elevated PSAs before rushing to biopsy their prostates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Men should get PSA testing in midlife with the goal of finding aggressive prostate cancer," he said. "If we find low-grade disease along the way, whether or not we call it cancer, we should not treat it. We just monitor it with active surveillance. If we do that, we can erase this cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new approach to prostate cancer screening emerges&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tyler Seibert, a radiation oncologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, is not as optimistic about eliminating prostate cancer. But he too is dedicated to finding ways to identify the bad prostate cancers and treating only them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When doctors first began doing PSA screening tests, he said, "there was a flawed assumption that was implicit that if you find any kind of prostate cancer, you must treat that kind of prostate cancer aggressively," he said. "Many of them would never have harmed the patient."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, Seibert believes. Today, instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, he and an increasing number of prostate-cancer specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For these patients with low-risk prostate cancer, we have really strong evidence that we can follow them closely, and they basically can just carry on with their life," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is comfortable with getting periodic blood tests to see if their PSA might be rising and they might indeed need cancer treatment, Seibert acknowledged. But most of his patients do become comfortable with the protocol, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Every time you get that blood test, you're kind of a little bit nervous," he said. "If you can tolerate that, and you don't think that it's going to be causing you too much anxiety, then screening makes a lot of sense."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ronnie Cohen is freelance health journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The study also found that cereals’ protein and fiber content — nutrients essential for a healthy diet — have been in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings, based on an analysis of 1,200 new or reformulated cereal products introduced in the United States between 2010 and 2023, are likely to add fuel to the ongoing debate about the relationship between processed food, mounting childhood obesity and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The debate has gained greater prominence in the months since health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. began using the federal bully pulpit to excoriate ultra-processed foods as part of his “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.maha.vote/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” campaign. Mr. Kennedy, who has declared that “sugar is poison,” last month &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/well/food-dyes-ban.html" title=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Health and Human Services would work to remove some artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply, citing concerns about their impact on children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Shuoli Zhao, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Kentucky and a co-author of the new study, said the findings were especially notable given evolving consumer awareness about the links between excess consumption of sugar, salt and saturated fat and chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“What’s most surprising to me is that the healthy claims made on the front of these products and the nutritional facts on the back are actually going in the opposite direction,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The analysis, based on data gathered by the marketing consultancy Mintel, did not identify brand names, nor did it capture information on purchasing and consumption habits. The vast majority of the 1,200 products it analyzed were relaunches of existing cereals, including so-called reformulations that alter a product’s taste or nutritional content, Professor Zhao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

                The first Alzheimer's blood test cleared by the Food And Drug Administration is set to make diagnosis more accessible and accurate — and change the way doctors treat the disease.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A new blood test that detects a hallmark of Alzheimer's is poised to change the way doctors diagnose and treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The test, the first of its kind to be &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;cleared&lt;/a&gt; by the Food and Drug Administration, is for people 55 and older who already have memory problems or other signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results show whether the brain of a person with cognitive symptoms also has amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic proteins that build up in the spaces between brain cells. The presence of plaques in a person with cognitive symptoms usually confirms an Alzheimer's diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I think the blood test is going to really revolutionize the way people with Alzheimer's are cared for and diagnosed," says &lt;a href="https://www.alzdiscovery.org/about-addf/people/howard-fillit" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Howard Fillit&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer at the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Primary care physicians will now have access to something that can give them a quicker read" on whether a patient has Alzheimer's, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/maria_c_carrillo_ph_d__;!!Iwwt!VrdWEd07buTn9e3_1U59sDhdIjoDbFFDZXMHo1heaKWdign1BJrnWydkO67oLWq1w8L5yJM874hC$" target="_blank"&gt;Maria Carrillo&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One benefit of a readily-available blood test will be more accurate diagnoses, Fillit says, noting that currently, primary care doctors correctly diagnose patients only about 60% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Specialty neurologists get it right like seventy, eighty percent of the time," He says. "With the blood test, we can get it up to over 90%."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/Supplement_1/13S" target="_blank"&gt;PET scan&lt;/a&gt; is the gold standard for detecting the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's. But the technology is costly, and unavailable in many communities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another option is to test fluid from a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that most doctors and patients tend to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are already&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/02/g-s1-14852/alzheimers-new-blood-tests-amyloid-tau-ptau217-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt; lab-developed blood tests&lt;/a&gt; that can signal the presence of amyloid. But the Lumipulse assay, made by the diagnostic company Fujirebio, is the first to receive marketing clearance from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Having such a test is likely to mean that many more people will be diagnosed when their symptoms are still mild, and potentially treatable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/30/g-s1-63345/alzheimers-survey-americans-testing-treatment-risky" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from the Alzheimer's Association found that the vast majority of older Americans would take a blood test to find out if they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who are diagnosed while still in the early stages of Alzheimer's may be eligible to receive one of the two &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5309499/alzheimers-was-taking-her-memory-so-she-started-taking-a-new-drug" target="_blank"&gt;amyloid-reducing drugs&lt;/a&gt; now on market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lab-developed blood tests have been used primarily by researchers, or by specialists in large medical centers. The test cleared by the FDA is likely to attract a much broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been through rigorous evaluation, and it provides guidance for prescribers on who's eligible and when the test should be provided," Carrillo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The result should be more testing of people in rural or underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Blood tests have given us an opportunity to really democratize this kind of testing," Carrillo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It also means that many more of the estimated &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;7.2 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; thought to be living with Alzheimer's are likely to get a formal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To help health health care providers counsel these individuals, the Alzheimer's Association is writing guidelines on how to speak to patients about the results of a blood test, what it means to live with the disease, and what the treatment options are.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidelines are expected this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

The immune system goes into overdrive and starts attacking healthy tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause a fever, rashes and inflammation in crucial organs such as the liver, lungs and kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Minocycline is&lt;span&gt; prescribed to around 1million Americans every year for &lt;/span&gt;various bacterial infections including pneumonia and in some cases, acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While facial acne is usually a result of hormonal imbalances and clogged pores, it can also be caused by bacteria on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Dunn's case, doctors struggled to pinpoint the cause of her deteriorating condition as her body continued to swell up and develop rashes for weeks at end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled in a TikTok video: 'Every single one of [my] organs was shutting down and [doctors] told my parents that [I] was actually going to die.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As doctors scrambled to find out what was happening to Dunn, the then-teenager stopped breathing for about 30 minutes due to the severity of her condition and had to be put on assisted breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/teen-takes-acne-medication-briefly-dies-from-rare-drug-reaction-exclusive-11704952"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/a&gt;: 'I remember just feeling like my body was shutting down. I had no idea what was happening to me, and neither did the doctors at first.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However two weeks later, doctors misdiagnosed her with Parvovirus - a contagious virus mainly affecting children that can cause facial rashes and a fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DReSS symptoms can cause an outbreak of measles-like rashes all over the body. (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she continued to remain in immense pain as her symptoms worsened over the next two months and had to return back to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, a medical student realized that she was suffering from DReSS syndrome after they had spent a week learning about the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DReSS syndrome is most commonly triggered by antibiotics and can be caused by any form of the anti-bacterial drug. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its symptoms can cause an outbreak of measles-like rashes all over the body, high fever, increase in white blood cells in the blood, swelling in the lymph nodes and injuries to internal organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact mechanisms of how the syndrome is triggered remains unknown but experts believe it is usually due to a combination of genetic factors and the immune system's response to certain drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists estimate that one in 10,000 suffer from the condition - out of which one in 10 die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The syndrome is usually treated with a combination of topical steroid treatments and anti-inflammatory medication.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Dunn's case, as doctors scrambled to find out what was happening to her, the then-teenager stopped breathing for about 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her diagnosis, Dunn told the magazine: 'When they finally told me it was DReSS syndrome, I had never heard of it before. I had no idea an antibiotic for acne could do this to me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the severity of her condition, she was asked to use steroid treatments for weeks to suppress her immune system and stop the spread of the rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dunn now claims that she has since learned to be extremely cautious with medication and does not take any medication without checking with experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, she has also begun efforts to raise awareness about the syndrome and said: 'If my story can help even one person recognize signs early and get the right diagnosis, then it's worth sharing .'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:50:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>FDA首次通过血液检测诊断阿尔茨海默病- AOL.com | FDA Clears First Blood Test to Diagnose Alzheimer’s Disease - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTFBXaDlSQ2hubm0zWGRFcWcyZzVJUWhnNm1jTFNzcDR6d1ZWbElLTzFmLVhXUkItU2ExdWJSVWd0eXNiVS1NUGh3UDkxcE1lM0R6dEg0VFBMZWIwUFJ5OTJMN3JzQk1fQnF1Mm1mVjNBQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;

clearance of the test — Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio —  manufactured by the Pennsylvania-based biotechnology company Fujirebio Diagnostics.

It progressively affects memory, thinking and behavior seriously enough to interfere with daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood test was cleared for use in people age 55 and older who exhibit signs and symptoms of the disease.

They can take this test as a screening test,” he said. “This is a much more simple screening test, with reasonable accuracy, to tell the physician that a person with cognitive decline has symptoms that are actually due to Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the clearance is a step forward, Isaacson stressed that more research is necessary to determine how the blood test results should be interpreted and used to make medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/alzheimers-diagnosis-blood-test-fda-gives-clearance-11739232" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:42:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBXaDlSQ2hubm0zWGRFcWcyZzVJUWhnNm1jTFNzcDR6d1ZWbElLTzFmLVhXUkItU2ExdWJSVWd0eXNiVS1NUGh3UDkxcE1lM0R6dEg0VFBMZWIwUFJ5OTJMN3JzQk1fQnF1Mm1mVjNBQQ</guid></item><item><title>眼部检查可以区分帕金森氏症和继发性帕金森氏症-《今日帕金森新闻》 | Eye test can distinguish Parkinson’s from secondary parkinsonism - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNQ3hLdllxdDBLcWVucm9qeVk4QlNjUGdhTUZ2aUhuSkFjVW5KUWdKNWJPbjQ3NHh1RVhCUm9mb1pYckJJYnFsMDFSb1lCN2JzdDJla1RRU1NVT2ZINDFPa1ZmNi1RbVRRZUNfUUxBR3Y4MGxjSTRCbUJCUUp2MmtDRG9mVTllRVROYkFyWkRZMTFMRkF6NFFZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging of nerves in the eyes may be used to differentiate between &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and secondary forms of parkinsonism, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-00969-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corneal confocal microscopy differentiates patients with secondary parkinsonism from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Parkinson’s can cause abnormalities in nerves connecting eyes and brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;caused by the dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; and death of brain cells that are responsible for making the chemical messenger dopamine. Parkinson’s is marked by &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as slowed movement, tremor, stiffness, and balance issues. Most people with Parkinson’s have idiopathic disease, meaning the underlying cause is not known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/types-of-parkinsons-disease/#Secondary"&gt;Secondary parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt; refers to health conditions that can cause Parkinson’s-like motor symptoms, but are not actually Parkinson’s disease. Secondary parkinsonism can develop due to drugs or toxins, or because of problems with blood flow or fluid pressure in and around the brain. Since secondary parkinsonism is by definition characterized by symptoms that are similar to Parkinson’s disease, it can be difficult for clinicians to tell the two apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease can cause abnormalities in the nerves that connect the eyes to the brain, which are generally less affected in secondary parkinsonism. These nerves can be visualized using a technique called corneal confocal microscopy, or CCM. In this study, scientists in China tested whether CCM might be used to reliably distinguish between true Parkinson’s disease and secondary parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson’s disease].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included 45 people with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and 25 with secondary parkinsonism. The researchers found patients with Parkinson’s had a lower density of nerve fibers detected by CCM than those with secondary parkinsonism. They also tended to have more branch-like protrusions on their nerves than those with secondary parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test if these CCM-based measures could distinguish between the two conditions, the researchers calculated a statistical value called the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This is a statistical test of how well a measure (in this case, CCM) can distinguish between two groups, Parkinson’s or secondary parkinsonism in this study. AUC values can range from 0.5 to 1, with higher numbers reflecting better accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUC for CCM in this study was 0.924, suggesting high accuracy for distinguishing true Parkinson’s from secondary parkinsonism. The researchers noted they could get even better accuracy if they also included clinical measures like assessments of symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson’s disease],” the scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

Using validated mental health screening tools, researchers found that 1 in 4 children had new anxiety symptoms and 1 in 7 had new depressive symptoms, despite no prior mental health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These children reported a quality of life comparable to peers with serious illnesses like cancer or cystic fibrosis, with many expressing a deep sense of ineffectiveness and loss of confidence. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated mental health screening and early intervention in pediatric long COVID care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Onset:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly 40% of children with long COVID reported anxiety or depression; half had no prior diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of Life:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental health impact was comparable to that of serious chronic illnesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; A child’s sense of ineffectiveness was the strongest predictor of poor life quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Kennedy Krieger Institute is calling attention to an emerging mental health crisis among children with long COVID. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that nearly 40% of pediatric patients with long COVID reported feeling significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 139 patients evaluated at Kennedy Krieger’s Pediatric Post-COVID-19 Rehabilitation Clinic. Clinicians used mental health screening surveys to assess symptoms reported by the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screenings also included measures of key aspects of quality of life including: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1 in 3 children reported that they were experiencing elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression (i.e. worry, sleep problems, and mood irritability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. Laura Malone, director of the clinic and co-investigator in this research, says half of these children had no prior mental health concerns or diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long COVID is a complex condition,” said Malone. “We’re seeing children and teens who were doing well before their COVID infection now struggling to attend school, socialize, or even enjoy basic activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 in 4&lt;/strong&gt; children had new anxiety symptoms, and &lt;strong&gt;1 in 7&lt;/strong&gt; had new depressive symptoms, despite &lt;em&gt;no prior diagnosis&lt;/em&gt;—a sign long COVID is triggering new mental health challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average, children reported a quality of life similar to peers with&lt;strong&gt; cancer or cystic fibrosis&lt;/strong&gt;, underscoring the severe functional impact of the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The strongest predictor of poor quality of life was&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;“sense of ineffectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;,” like feeling unable to succeed in life or enjoy activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These children are losing confidence in themselves and their ability to participate in daily life,” said Dr. Malone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That loss of function can be just as devastating as the physical symptoms. It is important to identify and treat both to improve quality of life for children with long COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have hinted at long COVID’s mental health toll, this is one of the first to use standardized, validated measures of mental health issues in a pediatric long COVID population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also warns that traditional screening tools may not capture the full picture, since physical symptoms of long COVID (like fatigue or dizziness) can overlap with those of anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Kennedy Krieger urge healthcare providers to integrate routine mental health screening into care for children with long COVID. Early identification could mean faster access to the right interventions, therefore helping kids recover more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this long COVID and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d592b9b0b4a6babb81b4959eb0bbbbb0b1ac9ea7bcb0b2b0a7fbbaa7b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Taylor Gleason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://KennedyKrieger.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Taylor Gleason – Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 16:28:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBkNnpUN0llRFRrZFp1by1KdXViOVp5R2sxNjBGNnlrVUkxTEtkTy01QnMwNXd1TnYxYVpUR1U4dkZMSC1SNnBWcW43aGM2RFJzLXE4aWdXUnplTlczQzA3TmNvMlZvUGdKX21WMDlCbzNacnVH</guid></item><item><title>专家说，昂贵的阿尔茨海默氏症生活方式计划提供了虚假的希望-纽约时报 | An Expensive Alzheimer’s Lifestyle Plan Offers False Hope, Experts Say - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNZ2ItcVVyblNKbEtyWUxFcGViNnE1RzFaWTNMdjh4UjZ2NUVwc3dYdk9QNFJaU1ZlWXdHYWE3bzhxLWlmeW9HV19KdUZsbzlCc1ZhY0RrTThuLW1PQ3FmTnVPUnZuWWxBbEJjUXEwOWpUUTlMTFN5aUVmOGNYa2FhYzUxaXBheFpOZUNNNXlHNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Kerry Briggs had trouble keeping track of the supplements. To help, her husband, John Briggs, created a spreadsheet with rows for ashwagandha, Omega-3 and curcumin extract. There was ginseng, lion’s mane mushroom and the antioxidant liposomal glutathione, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs, 64, had started taking the supplements last July, a daily regimen that grew to include 34 capsules and tablets along with two scoops of powder. When it became too much, Mr. Briggs began blending them into a shake, to which he added brown food coloring so it looked less like its natural “sickly” olive shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs was taking them all because a doctor had told her that with enough supplements and lifestyle modifications, her Alzheimer’s symptoms could not only be slowed, but reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It is an idea that has become the focus of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/title-2538046" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;television specials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://youtu.be/UyneMnERmnI?si=5JHTmPvmph-Qim_0&amp;amp;t=8760" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;popular podcasts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://drtalks.com/summit/reverse-alzheimers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;; the sell behind mushroom supplements and self-help books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the suggestion that Alzheimer’s can be reversed through lifestyle adjustments has outraged doctors and scientists in the medical establishment, who have repeatedly said that there is little to no proof for such a claim, and expressed concern that the idea could harm a large group of vulnerable Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Briggs had come across the idea after learning about Dale Bredesen, who had been performing a series of small and unconventional studies through which he claimed to have designed a set of guidelines to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

              &lt;p&gt;A family vacation to Costa Rica turned sour after 12 of 13 relatives developed symptoms of a fungal lung infection following an excursion through bat-filled caves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In season two of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, the cordyceps fungus—spoiler alert—becomes airborne, meaning the fungal infection can spread not just through bites but also when humans inhale its spores. While the TV show is highly fictitious, airborne fungi are most certainly not. A U.S. family now knows this better than most, since 12 of their members became ill after touring a bat cave in Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7417a1.htm"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers described 12 confirmed or probable cases of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24811-histoplasmosis"&gt;histoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;: a pulmonary infection caused by inhaling the fungus &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;. This fungus lives in soil, frequently alongside bird or bat droppings, and can become airborne if the earth is disturbed. While symptoms are usually subtle, the infection can make infants and immunocompromised people vulnerable to more serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a vacation to Costa Rica in December of last year, 12 of 13 family members toured the bat-colonized Venado Caves, an ancient cave system and popular tourist destination. This essentially meant crawling through bat poop for two hours. When they returned to the U.S., everyone—except the one family member who hadn’t toured the cave—became ill to varying degrees, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, night sweats, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Five family members sought medical attention. Doctors tested four of them for fungal infections, and two tested positive for histoplasma. Two of the patients also had abnormal chest X-rays, one of which raised concern for possible lung cancer. After learning about their spelunking expedition, healthcare providers notified the CDC, which launched an investigation. Notably, the cave they had visited had also likely caused a histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998 and 1999.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame,” the team, led by CDC researchers, wrote in the report. “However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.” In other words, given that it’s harder to detect histoplasmosis in healthy patients, the family members who tested negative might still have had histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, doctors confirmed that one family member had histoplasmosis, eight members probably did, and three were suspected of having it. Fortunately, none of them became zombies—or had lung cancer—and within 28 days of exposure, they were all on their way to recovery. While doctors usually prescribe antifungal medication for patients with severe histoplasmosis, many cases in healthy individuals &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/histoplasmosis/treatment#:~:text=Most%20cases%20of%20histoplasmosis%20go,infection%20and%20your%20immune%20status."&gt;go away&lt;/a&gt; on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Histoplasmosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose. As such, the researchers urge clinicians to “consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis,” they concluded. In collaboration with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health, the CDC hopes to see the risk of histoplasmosis included in the Venado Caves tour waiver forms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising that &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is so popular. After all, Andrzej Sapkowski—author of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8205437-there-s-a-grain-of-truth-in-every-fairy-tale-love"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that “there’s a grain of truth in every fairy tale.” That seems to hold true, even in a fungal zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzfd000o3b77gnanjc6t@published"&gt;I am a gay man, and discovered a Fleshlight in my husband’s underwear drawer while I was putting some of his clothes away a few days ago. When I confronted him about it, he said a (female) friend of his gave it to him as a joke for April Fool’s Day, and he just wanted to “try it out.” We have an active and fulfilling sex life (or at least I thought). Do I have reason to be concerned that I may not be enough for him, or worse, that he may have needs I can’t satisfy?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzjr000r3b778dpii073@published"&gt;The implications of your question trouble me. Do you think your husband is not entitled to self-pleasure? Would you be similarly offended to learn that he uses his … &lt;em&gt;hand&lt;/em&gt; to masturbate? How much control over his sexuality do you think you’re entitled to? You’re gay, so surely you’re aware of the widespread practice of open relationships within your tribe, right? Plenty of relationships survive not only their constituent partners masturbating, but partners having sex with other people, sometimes in large group settings. That’s enough to make a Fleshlight look about as threatening to a relationship as a flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzl4000s3b770qtsoeww@published"&gt;People seek pleasure from sources other than their primary partner for a number of reasons. Yeah, it may have something to do with dissatisfaction, but it just as easily might not. If you are indeed in a monogamous relationship, and I assume so given your reaction to your husband having sex with an inanimate object, maybe all he wants is some variety. People like novelty, and masturbating, even with a toy, is a way to experience it. You are better off going with your gut and what your husband tells you. If you think your sex life is active and fulfilling, it probably is. Unless you are oblivious to signs, you would know if there were an issue. Your husband likely has a healthy libido and an adventurous mind.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that you do satisfy plenty already. No one can be everything. In the future, instead of confronting your husband over something that intimidates you sexually, you should express curiosity. What does he like about that object and why? Is there anything he’d like to try that the two of you aren’t doing? If you went as far as to ask him to incorporate the Fleshlight in your sex life, you’d be showing him the kind of acceptance that will likely make him comfortable communicating about such things. That could take the mystery out of the situation and make it so you don’t have to wonder if you should be concerned or whether you’re fulfilling his needs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94f001m3b772i8m3ihc@published"&gt;Mike’s birthday was nearly a month ago, and Rachel and I decided the threesome would be the perfect surprise. The trouble was, when the moment came, Mike COULD NOT get it up, which is completely unusual for him. No matter what we tried, he remained a limp noodle. Needless to say, everyone ended up sorely disappointed. But that isn’t the worst of it. Ever since then, my husband hasn’t been able to achieve an erection. I’ve suggested going to see a urologist, but Mike is so embarrassed and depressed that he refuses. Now I’m scared we’ll never have sex again! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="182" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94f001p3b778aixvx8n@published"&gt;Maybe you start by letting Mike know that what he experienced is not uncommon at all. For as much as he wanted the threesome, and as much pleasure as it seemed to promise, years of fantasizing were leading up to that moment. That alone can make for a pressurized situation that promotes performance anxiety. Possibly compounding the situation was that you sprung it on him. You and Rachel had the best intentions for doing so and reason to assume that it would go in a mutually satisfying direction, but it didn’t. Anxiety, period, is a huge boner killer, and one can get stuck in a cycle of worrying about not getting hard, not being hard, and then worrying more about how it’s coming across. It can be difficult to break that cycle, no matter how hot the situation or even how affirming one’s partners are. It certainly helps when the partner(s) don’t buy into the anxiety or pressure, but there’s no guarantee that shrugging it off will actually help. Expressions of “sore” disappointment, though, almost certainly make an already fraught situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="257" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94h001q3b77n5l4r5nu@published"&gt;Erectile dysfunction drugs, in addition to opening up vessels and getting the blood flowing, can work as anti-anxiety meds. Knowing you have a little bit of extra lift can abate some of that nervousness and make it easier to perform. It might be that your husband doesn’t have much experience with PDE5 inhibitors since you report that his limpness during your failed threesome was “completely unusual for him.” (Granted, he may have discreetly popped a Viagra or Cialis in the past that you weren’t aware of.) If he has no experience with these drugs, he should get a prescription—they could be a game changer, and they’re easy enough to obtain online with minimal provider contact. I don’t necessarily condone having minimal contact with a provider, but it’s clear that a lot of guys are embarrassed about this stuff, and don’t like visiting the doctor regardless of the issue, so telehealth companies like Hims and Ro are taking a lot of the discomfort out of the process. Yeah, going to a urologist could help Mike—what you describe sounds like a circumstantial ED issue that has psychological roots, but hearing from a doctor that Mike isn’t broken and this issue is fixable could make a big difference. Still, if the guy won’t go, you can’t make him. Maybe you wait it out a bit more, let the problem remain persistent, and Mike may drop his resistance to the doctor. For a non-medical intervention in the meantime, he could try a cock ring. It’s not foolproof, but it may help.&lt;/p&gt;

Your sister wasn’t necessarily asking for a solution to her problem, just for your ear and compassion. It sounds like she is more on the emotional side, while you lean pragmatic. It makes a certain kind of sense that you bought her a sex toy, given her issues, and I’m sure you meant well. But you did this, by your own admission, because of her dating problems. She reacted emotionally, but a version of, “You bought this for me because I couldn’t get a man,” is the truth. The gift may have, in fact, reminded her of her dating frustrations primarily, so much so that it didn’t have a shot at ameliorating her sexual ones—if she even has those! She may not be having issues finding sex, or she may already have sex toys she uses and likes, rendering the potential usefulness of your gift moot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94p001w3b770tei01mx@published"&gt;If you don’t have the kind of relationship where you talk about sex and/or masturbation in any detail, and if you’ve never gifted her with a sex toy before, she probably found the dildo inappropriate. It’s really never a safe bet to give someone a sex toy, unless you’re intimately involved with them and know they like them. Did you act incorrectly? Well, kinda. I think your intentions were pure, but not necessarily well thought out, and when it comes to giving gifts, it really is the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

I also haven’t been on a date. My life has pretty much been surrounded by doctors and hospitals as I learn to cope with chronic illness. But I’m at a point now where I’d like to date and maybe have sex again. But I don’t know where to start. I’m submissive, and this might sound weird, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/sexual-fantasy-smell-sex-advice.html"&gt;but the absolute most important thing is they have to smell “right.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Science has pretty well established that the brain isn’t static; it changes and adapts throughout our lives in response to life events in a process called &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/neuroplasticity" target="_blank"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Researchers are discovering this is especially true of female brains, which get remodeled significantly during the three Ps: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/health/teen-tween-developing-brains-wellness/index.html"&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt; (as do the brains of adolescent males), pregnancy and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/07/health/menopause-effect-brain-gupta-wellness"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;.

            All three transitions are a frequent butt of pop-culture jokes: the  sulky, risk-taking teenager who only wants to be with friends; the scattered mom-to-be who leaves her cell phone in the fridge and can’t remember where she parked the car; and the hormonal middle-aged woman who can’t focus and spontaneously combusts with hot flashes.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000f3b6mdfseylyx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But far from being laughable, these behavioral stereotypes are the external manifestations of big internal shifts, many of them linked to the effects of fluctuating hormones on the brain.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000g3b6md9args8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive neuroscientist Laura Pritschet, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, is fascinated by how female hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, affect the brain’s organization and functioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000h3b6m7fpfz720@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reason I chose that field is because I was a budding neuroscientist as an undergrad, interested in brain networks and obsessing over how intricate everything was in the brain to simply allow us to have a personality or remember things,” Pritschet told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000i3b6m7u79h7fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the same time in my personal life, I was surrounded by menopausal women who were talking about their cognitive complaints and their attention issues,” she said. “I thought we’ve got to connect these two together and understand this more.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000j3b6meb58bn78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet even volunteered as a “guinea pig” during graduate school, having her brain scanned and blood drawn for 30 days, across two complete reproductive cycles (both on and off birth control pills), to begin to answer the question of how the day-to-day fluctuations in hormones relate to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8975130/" target="_blank"&gt;day-to-day changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000k3b6m9s4axi0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around this time, other researchers were studying what happens in the brain during pregnancy, Pritschet said, looking at the brain before and after gestation. They found many changes, but because the studies took a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27991897/" target="_blank"&gt;snapshot approach&lt;/a&gt;, many questions were left unanswered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000l3b6mnr7gqlf5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s a 3 to 5% decrease in total gray matter volume, when is that occurring (during pregnancy), and how is it occurring?” Pritschet asked. “We’re missing huge gaps in what we call this metamorphosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000m3b6m5d3ucroc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;We know that the 40-week gestational window leads to these body adaptations to support the development of the fetus: We have increased plasma volume, immune function change, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption,” she said. “What does this trajectory look like over gestation?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000n3b6m4tqk9xla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To find out, Pritschet and her team &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/how-pregnancy-changes-brain-study-wellness"&gt;tracked the brain changes&lt;/a&gt; in one woman, using MRI and blood draws, from pre-conception and fertility treatment throughout her pregnancy to two years postpartum. Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01741-0" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

            “We saw this reduction in gray matter volume pretty much across the whole brain,” Pritschet explained. “We saw increased white matter microstructure and ventricle size.” (Quick anatomy lesson: The brain is made up of gray and white matter. Gray matter is where most of the brain’s thinking and processing takes place. White matter helps connect the different brain areas, allowing them to communicate with one another.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000v3b6mchlf1wko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The inflection point was birth,” Pritschet said. “We saw that those reductions persisted into postpartum, with slight recovery, meaning that certain areas of the brain showed this rise in gray matter volume in early postpartum. Others did not.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000w3b6mfgdmmeob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet said this “choreographed dance between major features of our brain” is in one respect a physical adaptation to the increased blood flow and swelling that comes with pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000x3b6mpj8vykm0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the changes  may also be a preparation for the next stage: parenting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000y3b6mlbxtaxxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a fine-tuning of circuits,” she explained. “We know that pregnancy is the lead-up to this time in your life where there’s a lot of behavioral adaptation that has to occur, and new cognitive demands, and a new cognitive load.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000z3b6m5rjtc4sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And so the idea here is that there is this pruning or this delicate rewiring to make certain networks or to make communication in the brain more efficient to meet the demands that are going to have to occur,” Pritschet said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00103b6mrusx1xhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This theory is supported by earlier work. “The first pinnacle papers that came out looking at neuroanatomy in human women from preconception to postpartum found that degree of change in gray matter volume — that sort of reduction — correlated with various … maternal behaviors (such as bonding). Again, that’s all correlation,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00113b6my42uf1re@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s an area we need to do a lot more research on, and it needs a lot of context,” she said. “But you can expect that if there’s fine-tuning in these circuits that underlie cognitive or behavioral process, that the more fine-tuning it undergoes, the better performance you’re going to have. That’s the idea — but it’s so much more complicated than that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00123b6mnqa8qzmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;hat    happens to the brain during pregnancy? Pritschet offers these three insights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00133b6mwxox03ed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The body is the outward sign of a lot of inner upheaval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00143b6m5rfnesmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pregnancy is a transformative time in a person’s life where the body undergoes rapid physiological adaptations to prepare for motherhood,” Pritschet said via email. “But pregnancy doesn’t just transform the body — it also triggers profound change to the brain and reflects another critical period of brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00153b6msg6kzdpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She called this remodeling   an often-overlooked period of brain development that takes place well into a woman’s adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00163b6mr79by7ww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Less gray matter may not sound very positive, but it happens for a reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00173b6mfyywoaz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite what one might think, these reductions are not a bad thing, and in fact, are to be expected,” Pritschet said, noting that some of the losses are eventually regained. “This change could indicate a ‘fine-tuning’ of brain circuits, not unlike what happens to all young adults as they transition through puberty and their brain becomes more specialized.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00183b6miv7xuri0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These changes could also be a response to the high physiological demands of pregnancy itself, she said, “showcasing just how adaptive the brain can be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmax6wc6d001e3b6mnfyb8w86@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="these-changes-could-affect-future-health-and-behavior" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        These changes could affect future health and behavior
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00193b6m9csq3658@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mapping these changes could open the door to understanding an array of other neurological and behavioral outcomes including postpartum depression, headaches, migraines, epilepsy, stroke and parental behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001a3b6ma4tqkavx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The neuroanatomical changes that unfold during (pregnancy) have broad implications for understanding vulnerability to mental health disorders … and individual differences in parental behavior,” said Pritschet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001b3b6mkcyjtpwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may even provide critical insight into how the brain changes over a lifespan, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

She lives alone and insists she’s “just fine,” but I can see she’s slipping -- physically, mentally and emotionally. She has high blood pressure, diabetes and serious arthritis, but she won’t stay on her medications. She hasn’t been to a primary care doctor in over five years. She flat-out refuses cancer screenings or even basic lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R4WIVT64Z5HLDM3AKZLE3UCKDI"&gt;Lately, I’ve noticed what could be signs of early dementia -- getting lost on familiar roads, forgetting appointments, struggling to follow conversations. I finally got her to see a neurologist last fall, and they recommended a brain scan and further testing. She never followed through. Now she’s barely leaving the house and won’t let me bring in any outside help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MAD6VREZNJFHZHD33HUSQM5HQM"&gt;I’ve tried small changes to keep her safe -- grab bars in the bathroom, meal deliveries, even offering to go with her to doctor appointments. Every single time, she shuts me down with, “Don’t start” or, “I’m not an invalid.” She’s isolating more and her mobility is getting worse. I’m scared she’s going to fall or end up in the ER with something that could’ve been managed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VKRTX7T7GJEJXI5TKSZF34HADA"&gt;How do I respect her independence while also not sitting back and watching her decline? -- Worried and Worn Out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QUL4AH3HQRH2TO6X3R73NPXRIY"&gt;DEAR WORRIED: You are carrying a heavy burden, and I commend your patience and devotion.

The scan, which takes just 8 minutes, detects brain lesions centered on veins—a hallmark of MS—using a technique called T2*-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers introduced a simple diagnostic guideline known as the “rule of six,” confirming MS if six vein-centered lesions are found. This method not only improves patient comfort and reduces diagnostic delays but could also save healthcare systems millions by reducing hospital stays and complications from lumbar punctures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The 8-minute MRI replaces the need for painful lumbar punctures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Rule of Six’:&lt;/strong&gt; Finding six vein-centered brain lesions confirms MS diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost and Time Savings:&lt;/strong&gt; Could save the NHS up to £5 million annually and speed up diagnosis by 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts from the University of Nottingham have proven that multiple sclerosis (MS) can successfully be diagnosed using an MRI scan, meaning patients no longer need to undergo a painful lumbar puncture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, published in&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScuSf_jfL6tpUonbgB2vU9Gt3cvT52lVHXbtlWkFn0OAuJdnIUBEX7va0nHL8K2ld_hegOT7p2IwyyZRxdGHhTg-w2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScIpMCJLRFmrDuBtNOkBwr2LXYTSqoOGghZrcfqqiQodlMYO_1SFiU7aVsJj6OSE02gEj_5nj0h-f8eIFCJHjy5aA2"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;an official journal of the American Academy of Neurology, experts from the School of Medicine found that by using a new MRI scan, they could successfully diagnose MS in 8 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110232"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide the NHS with a scientific approach to diagnosing MS which is safer, more cost effective and more importantly acceptable to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS is a neurological condition which affects around 150,000 people in the UK. It is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it has many symptoms but not all sufferers experience all of them and the disease can progress at different rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no agreement on the best way to diagnose MS. Frequently, people suspected of having MS have a standard MRI scan and undergo a lumbar puncture, where a thin needle is inserted between the bones in the lower spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients often report they find it painful, and it can cause unintended complications requiring hospitalisation or time off work to recover. Although the fluid taken during a lumbar puncture can show evidence of disease, this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abnormalities are not found in everyone who has MS. Some people with conditions that can mimic MS, but need very different treatment, have similar lumbar puncture abnormalities. Both problems can lead to misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead author of the study, Professor Nikos Evangelou, Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University said: “More than half of all people diagnosed with MS in the UK have had at least one lumbar puncture, following the suspicion of MS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of our research are particularly exciting as we have now shown that we can give the diagnosis of MS without this painful procedure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a clinical MRI scanner, of the type all neuroscience centres have, to carry out a special type of scan called a T2*-weighted MRI which is able to reveal lesions in the brain’s white matter that are centred on a vein &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; a known indicator of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a conclusive diagnosis of MS, the team developed the ‘rule of six’, whereby if there were six lesions found with a central vein, this confirmed a diagnosis of MS without having to analyse all lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out a prospective study, in Nottingham, Cardiff and London with patients who had a suspected, but not definite diagnosis of MS. Each patient was given an 8-minute MRI scan and a lumbar puncture and after 18 months, they were able to find out what the diagnosis was and whether it matched that of their initial scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this study and previous research conducted in Nottingham and in the USA the International Committee for the diagnosis of MS, recently announced that the MRI scan, as first proposed by the Nottingham research team, is enough to diagnose MS. A lumbar puncture is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Evangelou adds: “Not only will our findings have huge benefits for patients, but it will also mean cost savings for the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who have lumbar punctures are required to spend at least most of a day in hospital, and for a health service already at capacity, this creates more issues. If there are complications with the lumbar puncture the stay can be longer. With the MRI scan, it takes 8 minutes, is completely safe, and then you can go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On average, we think we will reach the diagnosis three months earlier and the change could save the NHS up to five million pounds each year, which can be reinvested in better services for our MS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this MS and neuroimaging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97f4fff6e5fbf8e3e3f2b9e0f6fbfbd7f9f8e3e3fef9f0fff6fab9f6f4b9e2fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Wall – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Nikos Evangelou et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central vein sign (CVS) describes the presence of venules within multiple sclerosis (MS) brain lesions, visible on T2*-weighted MRI. In the upcoming revision of the MS diagnostic criteria, the simplified “rule of 6” (i.e., finding 6 lesions with a central venule) can support the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to lumbar puncture (LP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated whether a T2*-weighted MRI scan is more sensitive than oligoclonal bands (OCBs) for diagnosing MS at presentation with a typical clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). We also compared the tolerability of LP and the additional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants requiring an LP to meet the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS were enrolled in this multicenter, prospective, diagnostic superiority study from 3 UK neuroscience centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A six-minute T2*-weighted sequence was used to assess the CVS using 2 definitions: a 40% threshold of all eligible lesions and the rule of 6. These were compared with OCBs, using the clinical diagnosis at 18 months as the reference standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 113 participants, 99 (mean age: 38, female: 73%) have completed all study activities: 80 were diagnosed with MS, 10 remained CIS, 8 had alternative diagnoses, and 1 remained without a diagnosis. No significant difference in diagnostic sensitivity was detected between 40% CVS threshold (90% [CI 81%–96%]) and OCB testing (84% [CI 74%–91%]) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.332).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule of 6 had a sensitivity of 91% (CI 83%–96%). Side effects were reported by 75% following LP compared with 9% following MRI. All participants preferred their MRI scan over their LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS and OCB testing is equally sensitive in supporting the diagnosis of MS in cases of typical CIS. CVS assessed using the 40% threshold, and the simpler rule of 6 produces equivalent diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with OCB testing, CVS testing seems safer and better tolerated by patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate CVS specificity, particularly outside of typical CIS cases, as studied here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Classification of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides Class IV evidence that CSF OCBs and the CVS are equally sensitive in supporting a diagnosis of MS in patients presenting with CIS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:24:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5zVkhQZ1dDMFI3V2dLOUMwSVBZOEhUQ2VhUHU5T29jTHEtNmpwcGV0Vy1xb1dvSTdLWW1STHZoZzc4ZENQbWdsTW9kNktmSjU5dFpBbU11VUhQWjFZQ2hSb2RxaEV3QQ</guid></item><item><title>优于Ozempic ：科学家揭示最有效的减肥药物- SciTechDaily | Better Than Ozempic: Scientists Reveal Most Effective Weight Loss Drug - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:06:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ</guid></item><item><title>官员警告说，在大都会人寿体育场举行的夏奇拉音乐会上潜在的麻疹暴露- NBC新闻 | Officials warn of potential measles exposure at Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSnBLSWlOTzVnYl85U3IzR3lVNmhZQ0JMNm16cllyY1BvSGZfS0J5TFB2UGZpSHF0OWhRTHFfc0Fyblh5b3c0a0tKN011ZUdGYmxKNzc5MWlwYlFMazJpcWJhWUFmSjVOS1Y1WEdBWWJxOFBhTFJtdmtpSHVjaVJweU5iLTZYTGVyeW05Qm1KLWZnNnNBX05vRmtsVVVRU2fSAVZBVV95cUxOcXMtTGhHSnZCUHJRUW1STXo4ZEdvcDlGcE1laHoxV2FTTGVmZW85YTUwQzQ1VzdFemExUVVqdmVVMmFyMHo5MTljWWo0ZnQ5UjhpbUJkZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;New Jersey health officials issued a warning about a potential measles exposure during &lt;a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/how-to-get-to-shakira-concerts-metlife-njtransit-strike/4185716/" target="_blank"&gt;the Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) announced that a non-New Jersey resident attended the concert while infected with the disease.

You should not visit a medical facility without calling ahead. Anyone who was exposed at the concert could develop symptoms as late as June 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those who are at risk of being infected by the measles are people who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past. The MMR vaccine — which is administered in two doses — is the safest and most effective way to protect yourself against measles, mumps and rubella. The vaccine also prevents complications caused by those three diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials recommend that residents stay up to date on routine vaccinations, including MMR shots. Anyone traveling internationally should also be fully vaccinated before traveling and babies between 6 months and 11 months should get one dose of the MMR vaccine before traveling and two more doses after their first birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes and a rash that usually appears between three to five days after symptoms begin. The rash normally begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs and feet. Measles can also cause pneumonia and swelling of the brain. It can also lead to miscarriage in pregnant people, premature birth or a low-birth-weight baby, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The virus spreads through the air when someone coughs or sneezes and can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area.

NIH-funded breakthrough could enable targeted therapies for many neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research teams funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have created a versatile set of gene delivery systems that can reach different neural cell types in the human brain and spinal cord with exceptional accuracy. These delivery systems are a significant step toward future precise gene therapy to the brain that could safely control errant brain activity with high precision. In contrast, current therapies for brain disorders mostly treat only symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new delivery systems carry genetic material into the brain and spinal cord for targeted use by specific cell types. This platform has the potential to transform how scientists can study neural circuits. It provides researchers with gene delivery systems for various species used in research, without the need for genetically modified, or transgenic, animals. Examples include illuminating fine structures of brain cells with fluorescent proteins and activating or silencing circuits that control behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Imagine this new platform as a delivery truck dropping off specialized genetic packages in specific cell neighborhoods in the brain and spinal cord,” said John Ngai, Director of the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. “With these delivery systems, we can now access and manipulate specific cells in the brain and spinal cord – access that was not possible before at this scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new delivery tools, which use a small, stripped-down adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver DNA to target cells, can be broadly applied across many species and experimental systems, including small tissue samples removed during human brain surgeries. The delivery systems have been tested, or validated, in intact living systems, which is an important step for introducing new tools for widespread use. The newly published toolkit includes:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Dozens of delivery systems that selectively target key brain cell types, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons, striatal and cortical subtypes, brain blood vessel cells, and hard-to-reach neurons in the spinal cord that control body movement and are damaged in several neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Computer programs powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can identify genetic “light switches,” known as enhancers, that turn genes on in specific brain cell types, using data from many different species – cutting considerable time and effort for scientists looking for these genetic switches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this collection of research tools will significantly accelerate understanding of the human brain. Importantly, the toolkit enables access to specific brain cell types in the prefrontal cortex, an area that’s critical for decision-making and uniquely human traits. With other tools in the collection, scientists can better study individual cells and communication pathways known to be affected in several neurological diseases. These include seizure disorders, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease – as well as various neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAV-based treatments are already approved for some conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy for which a 2016 approval of a gene therapy known as Zolgensma transformed the lives of infants and young children who once faced severe disability or early death. The new collection of gene delivery resources lays the groundwork for more precise treatments that target only affected cells in the brain, spinal cord, or brain blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit is available at distribution centers including &lt;a href="https://www.addgene.org/collections/brain-armamentarium/"&gt;Addgene&lt;/a&gt;, a global supplier of genetic research tools. This collection of publications offers researchers standard operating procedures and user guides for these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is supported by the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. Funding issued less than four years ago launched a large-scale, team-run project to design new molecular tools that can be useful to many research laboratories. The &lt;a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/tools-and-technologies-brain-cells-and-circuits/armamentarium-precision-brain-cell-access"&gt;Armamentarium for Precision Brain Cell Access&lt;/a&gt; aims to develop precise and reproducible access to cells and circuits in experimental research models of the brain and spinal cord. The large-scale project brings together experts in the field of molecular biology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (AI). The eight papers appear in the May 21 issue of the journals &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cell, Cell Reports, Cell Genomics, and Cell Reports Methods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A common class of antidepressant medications might be even more useful than we thought. Research out today suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, can fend off cancer and boost the immune system’s defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00502-1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Cell. In mice and other lab experiments, they found that SSRIs shrunk a variety of cancers, improved the immune system’s ability to kill cancer cells, and bolstered the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The researchers now hope to conduct clinical trials of SSRIs for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serotonin, a hormone with many important functions, has a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.1750"&gt;complicated relationship&lt;/a&gt; with cancer. While it appears to promote the growth of certain tumor types, it also seems to enhance our immune response to cancer. Accordingly, scientists have hoped that existing drugs that interact with serotonin, including many antidepressants, could be repurposed to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several years ago, the UCLA researchers &lt;a href="https://stemcell.ucla.edu/news/drug-commonly-used-antidepressant-helps-fight-cancer-mice"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing MAO inhibitors—early generation antidepressants that regulate serotonin by inhibiting MAO—had an anticancer effect in mice. But these older drugs can cause serious side effects and interact badly with many other drugs or foods. So the researchers next decided to see if they could find a similar effect by targeting a different protein that interacts with serotonin, SERT. And as luck would have it, we already have existing and safer drugs that can inhibit SERT, the SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers used SSRIs on mouse and human models of several different cancers (some mice were given cancers derived from human cells, for instance): melanoma, breast, prostate, colon, and bladder cancer. On average, the treatment reduced the size of these tumors by more than 50%. Looking closer, the team also found that SSRIs appeared to make certain immune cells—killer T cells—better at recognizing and killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It turns out SSRIs don’t just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier—even while they’re fighting tumors,” said senior study researcher Lili Yang, a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084293"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “SSRIs made the killer T cells happier in the otherwise oppressive tumor environment by increasing their access to serotonin signals, reinvigorating them to fight and kill cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Yang and her team then paired SSRIs with another treatment that boosts the immune system’s response against cancer, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy; these drugs work by inhibiting certain proteins that normally keep immune cells from attacking tumors. In tests with mice, the combination further shrunk melanoma and colon cancer tumors, and in some cases, it even seemed to completely eradicate the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the findings come from mice and other lab experiments, so we’re still a long way from SSRIs being the next big thing in cancer treatment. But the fact that these drugs are already approved to treat depression is an added boon, the authors say. Compared to experimental treatments, for instance, it would take much less money and resources to develop and potentially win approval of SSRIs for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;UCLA, on behalf of the lead researchers, has filed a patent covering their combination approach, and the team is next looking to put their hypothesis to the test in an actual human trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to design a clinical trial to compare treatment outcomes between cancer patients who take these medications and those who do not,” said Yang, also a researcher at UCLA’s Goodman-Luskin Microbiome Center and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any luck, the same drugs that help ward off the blues can also become part of our arsenal against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Loneliness was closely tied to a cluster of defensive symptoms—pain, fatigue, and low mood—which were especially severe among the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that social connection helped reduce these symptoms, but the protective effects were strongest for those living in poverty. These findings suggest that social relationships are crucial to buffering the health impacts of economic disadvantage and highlight the need for targeted community support in low-income populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income-Loneliness Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; 49% of low-income individuals felt lonely vs. 15% of high-income peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Toll:&lt;/strong&gt; Lonely people in poverty showed the highest levels of pain, fatigue, and low mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Buffering:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong relationships most effectively reduced symptoms in the poorest groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oxford University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from the University of Oxford, published in &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, shows that European people in the lowest income deciles are much more likely to feel lonely than those in the highest income deciles, despite no difference in how often they socialise. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, both poverty and loneliness were strongly associated with higher scores on a defensive symptom cluster characterised by elevated levels of pain, fatigue and low mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the symptom-reducing effects of social connection were strongest for people living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110228"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two lonely people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for social, economic, and health policy, suggesting that strong social relationships may serve as important buffers against some of the health consequences of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defensive symptom cluster refers to set of frequently co-occurring and mutually reinforcing symptoms that, understood from an evolutionary perspective, represent the body’s response to danger and scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans evolved in groups which provided access to resources and protection from danger; when we feel socially excluded or isolated our bodies respond with a set of symptoms that are meant to protect us, for example pain helps protect us from injury, and fatigue and low mood may help us conserve energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, led by Dr Arran Davis of the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, examined data from a survey of 24,505 respondents across 20 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;People in the lowest income decile were much likely to report feeling lonely in the last week than people in the highest income decile; 49% compared to just 15%. This is despite there being no difference in the amount of time people in different income deciles reported socialising with family, friends, and colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who report feeling lonely have, on average, higher scores on the symptom cluster. The average lonely person has a symptom cluster score that is higher than 67% of not lonely people. However, the difference in the average symptom cluster score between lonely people and not lonely people is significantly larger in the lowest income decile than the highest income decile. The average lonely person in the lowest income decile has a symptom cluster score higher than 73% of non-lonely people in the same income decile. In the highest income decile, the average lonely person has a higher symptom cluster score than 65% of non-lonely people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30% of lonely individuals from the lowest income decile had high symptom cluster scores compared with just 2% of non-lonely people in the highest income decile, suggesting that social relationships play a particularly important role in influencing the health outcomes of people living in poverty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has identified supportive social relationships as buffers to the negative effects of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study suggest that as material resources decrease the importance of social resources increase, with those who are both in poverty and lonely displaying the highest symptom cluster scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, evolutionary anthropologist, Dr Arran Davis said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The relationship between poverty and poor health is well established, and previous research suggests that loneliness may be as bad for you as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that for people who are both on low incomes and lonely the health costs are particularly marked. I hope this study inspires more research into the factors that lead people to feel socially disconnected and to the development of policies that support strong communities in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this poverty and loneliness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a36332020333f743e2f342e323528343f1a3b3e373334743522743b39742f31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne – Oxford University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2025.02.037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/a&gt;” by Arran Davis et al. &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceived social isolation is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and depression.

Last week the CDC confirmed over 1,000 cases across 31 states, which have resulted in at least three deaths so far. The warning follows a similar alert issued by New Jersey health officials last week after an infected traveller passed through Newark Liberty International Airport, potentially exposing hundreds more people to the infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 14:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxON3lBckVqRzRUV2FVUlZaWnBLWXVpUG5HSUhrd0t3RWlCUnY0a0lOa2pURVJka1dzWEdQM2lwRWNydmlzR2dZM0dWZ0ZWZE14U3FtSHJYRnNyNDRxWUl5ZHpEaGdfZXo1RU43SHhORnE4NDRTUWRSdkFNb1dhNnV0Zm1wdWlzcjJCNGNiSjZWaFRKanJCOXZGbFdZT1U</guid></item><item><title>为期12年的研究揭示了使您延长寿命的运动类型—这不是有氧运动-汤姆指南 | 12-year study reveals the type of exercise that makes you live longer — it's not cardio - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxPNDE1MmRHbHNDeFpFbFp3aGZtQmZwdER2aWtnYWd2a19IcjNGNE5wSjdZUjJLMkZLS3BFa2lwd2lvQW5YV0FPY1BtQWVxc2pGTXFaZDVJcE9Ed0RqSTFLb3czejViZnNzY0NPdnhrNEczVWZjTy04bjV1WXZnTlhuRUY5UHFmTElSeWZiWWZxTFdZanJVQTFtSmlXQk1qbTNUeHZucW9kVkRsOXN5YzdpR0E1N0hRNVJUcG1VM0JtcU9udS1UVWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up your protein. Add collagen. Walk 10,000 steps. Get more sleep. The list of tips for living longer is endless, and much of the advice comes from people with more social media followers than qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tom’s Guide, the fitness team works hard to cut through the noise. In our latest search for evidence-backed insights, we found a fascinating study that suggests strength training could be a key piece of the longevity puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/a&gt;, the study followed more than 14,000 adults aged 50 and over for 12 years, using grip strength as a simple measure of muscle health. It found that people with lower grip strength had a 45 percent higher risk of death during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: strong muscles aren’t just about how you look, they could help you live a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-grip-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is grip strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength is exactly what it sounds like: how hard you can squeeze something with your hand. Think of it as your hand’s power meter. But it’s more than just winning at arm wrestling or opening stubborn jars. It’s actually a quick, simple way for doctors and researchers to get a snapshot of your overall muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because your grip says a lot about how strong your muscles are elsewhere in your body. As this study shows, keeping that strength up might just help you live longer and feel better as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-the-best-ways-to-build-better-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the best ways to build better strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, you don’t need to live at the gym or lift massive weights to build strength. In fact, small, consistent efforts can make a big difference, especially as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sTaY5QVZLcqQRuKeqdnVGK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sTaY5QVZLcqQRuKeqdnVGK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re starting out, bodyweight exercises like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/squats-how-to-do-them-and-the-benefits-for-building-leg-strength-and-muscle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/squats-how-to-do-them-and-the-benefits-for-building-leg-strength-and-muscle"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-do-a-push-up" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-do-a-push-up"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt;, or even getting up from a chair without using your hands (and repeating for a couple of sets) are great ways to begin.

Just two or three strength sessions a week can help to boost muscle, improve balance, and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with most things in life, the key is to find something you enjoy and stick with it. Strong muscles aren’t just about aesthetics, they can help you move better, feel better, and stay independent for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="Bowflex SelectTech 840 Adjustable Kettlebell,Amazon Basics Cast Iron Kettlebell,Gravity Fitness Spartanbell Kettlebell,Bulldog Gear Box kettlebells,ONNIT Primal Kettlebell,JaxJox KettlebellConnect,JaxJox Kettlebell Connect,JAXJOX KettlebellConnect 2.0,Wolverston competition kettlebell,TRX Kettlebell" data-name="Buying Guide Multimodel widget" data-widget-title="multimodelWidgetTitle" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-base"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Round up of today's best deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

But menopause can also take a toll on your oral health — a lesser-known symptom that deserves a lot more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Let’s start with the basics: Menopause is officially diagnosed when a person hasn’t had a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-period-underwear-ncna1273695" target="_blank"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt; for 12 months. Leading up to that is perimenopause, a transitional period when reproductive hormones, particularly estrogen, begin to drop. That hormonal shift is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with menopause, including the ones that can mess with your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To understand what’s going on, I spoke to two experts (a gynecologist and a dentist) who broke down how menopause affects your teeth and gums, plus what you can do to stay ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-2dfa70" id="anchor-2dfa70" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How does menopause affect your oral health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Estrogen plays a major role in maintaining the health of your oral tissues. When levels drop, your mouth can feel the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“During menopause, the decline in estrogen can lead to significant changes in the oral cavity, including dry mouth (xerostomia), burning tongue (glossodynia), increased gum sensitivity and changes in taste,” says Dr. Somi Javaid, a board-certified OB/GYN and founder of &lt;a href="https://hermd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;HerMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hormonal shifts can also raise your risk of gum inflammation, gingivitis and periodontal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Saliva production is another issue. “Saliva is essential for neutralizing acids, washing away bacteria and preventing tooth decay,” says Dr. Pia Lieb, a cosmetic dentist at &lt;a href="https://www.cosmeticdentistrycenternyc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cosmetic Dentistry Center NYC&lt;/a&gt;. “Without enough saliva, you’re more vulnerable to cavities, infections, and even trouble speaking or swallowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Menopause can also increase your risk of osteoporosis, which can affect the jawbone and potentially lead to tooth loss or complications with dental implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-ade8fc" id="anchor-ade8fc" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to protect your teeth during menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Now for the good news: You don’t have to kiss the health of your teeth goodbye just because you’re in perimenopause or menopause. According to our experts, you can do several things to prevent declining oral health during this time of life. Below, some of the most effective tactics: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice good oral hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;: “Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, and use alcohol-free &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-mouthwashes-rcna190988" target="_blank"&gt;mouthwash&lt;/a&gt;,” says Lieb. Regular flossing is also crucial, adds Javaid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; If dry mouth is an issue, increase your water intake, says Lieb. “You can also use saliva substitutes to keep your mouth hydrated.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to the dentist regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; “Regular checkups and cleanings become even more critical during and after menopause,” says Lieb. Plus, routine deep cleanings will prevent plaque buildup. Early detection and intervention can mitigate the progression of oral health complications associated with menopause,” says Javaid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your doctor: &lt;/strong&gt;Make an appointment with your gynecologist to discuss overall treatments for menopause that may be suitable for you. “Hormone therapy (HT) may be beneficial for many women, particularly when oral symptoms are part of a broader systemic hormonal deficiency,” says Javaid. “A comprehensive evaluation is essential to tailor treatment to the patient’s needs.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-0d2a3f" id="anchor-0d2a3f" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Menopause oral health products to shop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts told us that maintaining oral hygiene is crucial during menopause.

It also has a pressure sensor that alerts you if you are brushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This floss is an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-wellness-awards-products-2024-rcna145182" target="_blank"&gt;NBC Select Wellness Award&lt;/a&gt; winner, thanks in part to the fact that it’s made from recycled polyester, vegan wax and coconut oil and allows you to reach the back of your mouth while also soothing gums, according to the brand. NBC Select commerce editor &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/jordan-bowman-ncpn1307950" target="_blank"&gt;Jordan Bowman&lt;/a&gt; likes that it is on the thicker side because it easily grabs plaque or food scraps from in between his teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-b6a121"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd42870" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print mv8 product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-waterpik-aquarius-water-flosser-" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-waterpik-aquarius-water-flosser-"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timed settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjustable pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some people prefer to use a water flosser over regular floss.

It will act as a saliva substitute to hydrate a dry mouth. You get 40 sugar-free melts in a pack and they have a mild mint flavor.

Researchers analyzed DNA methylation, a cellular marker of aging, in men aged 50 to 72 who followed a nutrient-rich, plant-forward lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who consumed more methyl adaptogen foods showed significantly greater reductions in epigenetic age, even after adjusting for weight changes and starting biological age. These results reinforce the idea that specific dietary choices can meaningfully impact how we age at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetic Aging:&lt;/strong&gt; Measured through DNA methylation, epigenetic age reflects biological, not chronological, aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methyl Adaptogens:&lt;/strong&gt; Foods like garlic, green tea, turmeric, and berries were linked to slower cellular aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight and initial age differences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Impact Journals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new research paper was published in &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;, titled “Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this study, researchers led by first author Jamie L. Villanueva from the University of Washington and the National University of Natural Medicine, along with corresponding author Ryan Bradley from the National University of Natural Medicine and University of California, investigated how diet influences epigenetic aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110220"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows foods entwined into a DNA strand." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that certain plant-based foods containing natural compounds called methyl adaptogens were associated with a decrease in epigenetic age. This effect was measured using DNA methylation, a marker that reflects how the body ages at the cellular level. The findings suggest that targeted food choices may help slow the aging process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Epigenetic age refers to how old a person’s cells appear biologically, rather than their actual age in years. DNA methylation patterns, which are chemical tags on DNA, can indicate whether someone is aging faster or slower than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers used Horvath’s epigenetic clock, a widely accepted tool, to measure changes in epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis included healthy men aged 50 to 72 who had previously completed an eight-week program featuring a plant-based, nutrient-rich diet, along with guidance on exercise, sleep, and stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on individual dietary differences to understand why some participants experienced greater improvements in epigenetic age than others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that those who ate higher amounts of methyl adaptogen foods—including turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries, green tea, and oolong tea—experienced greater reductions in epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight changes and participants’ starting epigenetic age, suggesting that the foods themselves had a direct impact on aging markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural compounds in methyl adaptogen foods are known to influence how genes behave by affecting DNA methylation. Previous studies have shown that these compounds may support healthy aging and help lower the risk of conditions such as heart disease and cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While this study involved a relatively small group of middle-aged men, it adds knowledge to growing global research showing that diets rich in polyphenols—found in vegetables, fruits, and teas—are associated with slower aging. These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Future research should include larger and more diverse populations and use updated epigenetic aging tools to confirm these results. Based on current evidence, this study highlights a practical, food-based strategy that may help reduce epigenetic aging and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#670a02030e06270e0a170604130d08121509060b144904080a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ryan Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://impactjournals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact Journals &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan Braithwaite – Impact Journals&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.206240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study&lt;/a&gt;” by Ryan Bradley et al. &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Aging is the primary risk factor for developing non-communicable chronic diseases, necessitating interventions targeting the aging process. Outcome measures of biological aging used in these interventions are mathematical algorithms applied to DNA methylation patterns, known as epigenetic clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Methylation Diet and Lifestyle study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of a diet and lifestyle intervention that utilized epigenetic age as its primary outcome, measured using Horvath’s clock. Significant reductions in epigenetic age post-intervention were observed but with notable variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; This research aimed to identify dietary components associated with epigenetic age change across groups. Contributing factors to variability, such as weight changes and baseline differences in chronological and epigenetic age, were explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the intervention group lost significantly more weight than the control group, these changes were not associated with epigenetic age changes in the regression model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that consuming foods categorized as methyl adaptogens may reduce markers of epigenetic aging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 14:20:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE93WDhhdDBMcVJreXhCbTdUTV9QVDNXWHhyWk5vS0VLNUU2X19YOGJjeXphejdsOV81Yko4WVZkYmxpdkt3UlNtODNGdVEtOW5jMmJWN3ZLRHBUY3FidW5pM2MxNXpMUGNNTGNpaG4xM2s</guid></item><item><title>阿尔茨海默氏症的血液检测：须知-《纽约时报》 | A Blood Test for Alzheimer’s: What to Know - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1najFwOHNYSVVLWHEzVDI0cnd1RjVhNGNkQ2ZrVmJiM2xSMTJQUG05ZXBfQWtISVNtUElKNEVYTDBkSHA0dm5nU2p0Q2NLN3lfMEJ5NGhra1N4T3oyYlllcUtYajBrMXctNGRxS3Y1dU9zTDZQaThV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A blood test that can help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease has received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. This is a step toward a goal of scientists and doctors to one day be able to diagnose a confounding illness with the prick of a finger. But there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here is what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-65060e55"&gt;What is the test, and how should it be used?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The test, manufactured by Fujirebio Diagnostics,&lt;span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;is intended to be used only by specialists in Alzheimer’s, the F.D.A. said. Its mouthful of a name — Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio — describes what the test measures: levels of two proteins, amyloid and tau, that are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In people who develop Alzheimer’s, amyloid begins to accumulate and form plaques in the brain more than 20 years before any symptoms of cognitive impairment. Tau accumulates later, forming tangles in the brain, and is much more closely correlated with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-5c27f38e"&gt;Can people who don’t have memory problems take the blood test?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;No. The F.D.A., and Alzheimer’s experts, emphasized that the blood test should be given only to people who are already experiencing cognitive decline and are ages 55 and older.

CLU helps prevent the buildup of toxic amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins, both key drivers of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, DDL-357 reduced levels of phospho-tau, improved mitochondrial function, and enhanced cognitive performance in maze tests. Though still in early stages, this candidate drug may work alongside existing treatments and could eventually be used for other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; DDL-357 boosts secreted clusterin (sCLU), which protects against toxic brain buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated Alzheimer’s model mice showed improved memory and cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The drug may aid treatment for other diseases like ALS and Parkinson’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As researchers work to improve treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, new research by UCLA Health identified a candidate drug that reduces levels of a toxic form of a protein in the brain caused by the disease and improved memory in mice by boosting production of a protective protein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; journal &lt;em&gt;npj Drug Discovery,&lt;/em&gt; UCLA Health researchers targeted the protein clusterin (CLU), which is crucial in preventing the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins that that disrupt communication between brain cells and lead to memory impairment — a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110216"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer’s model mice by jumpstarting the brain’s memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, a variant of the gene that encodes clusterin was identified as the third strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. It was recently reported that increased CLU protein could provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCLA Health researchers led by Varghese John identified a candidate small molecule, DDL-357, that increased concentrations of secreted clusterin (sCLU) in Alzheimer’s mouse models, resulting in a reduction of the toxic protein phospho-tau and improvement of mitochondrial function, both associated with progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DDL-357 also improved the memory of treated mice in maze-based cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings open the door to the development of new treatments that not only target the underlying causes of Alzheimer’s disease but also restore lost cognitive function – something that existing therapies have yet to achieve,” said John, a professor of neurology and director of the Drug Discovery Laboratory (DDL) at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research and Care at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the drug candidate is still in pre-clinical testing and far from human trials, initial results suggest it could work in concert with existing Alzheimer’s disease treatments and may also be effective in treating other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”, John said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is one of the latest that John and fellow UCLA Health researchers at the Drug Discovery Laboratory have identified as potential candidates for development to treat Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer’s model mice by jumpstarting the brain’s memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study published in April found the molecule DDL-218 worked to increase levels in mouse brain of another protective protein, sirtuin 1, that is lower in people who carry apolipoprotein E4, a genetic variant of apolipoprotein, that confers the greatest risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These potential drug candidates provide an opportunity for the testing of new complimentary therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Neuropharmacology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2859a9d8781869d9cb29f97969c9786dc87919e93dc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Will Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Will Houston – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44386-025-00009-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer’s disease mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Varghese John et al. &lt;em&gt;npj Drug Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer’s disease mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite substantial research and drug discovery efforts, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remains the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mutation in the clusterin (CLU) gene that hinders expression of the cyto-protective secreted isoform of clusterin (sCLU) that affects the aggregation and clearance of two key proteins implicated in AD, Aβ and tau, is the third most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we present findings from our drug discovery program to identify small molecules that enhance sCLU levels and assess their impact on AD pathology and cognition in a murine model of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-throughput screening campaign identified two classes of epigenetic modulators that increase sCLU levels with subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts leading to bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor new chemical entities (NCEs) with enhanced potency, drug-like properties, and oral brain bioavailability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead candidate NCE, DDL-357, increased brain sCLU in the murine ApoE4TR-5XFAD model of AD in a subchronic study. In a follow-up chronic study in the murine 3xTg-AD model, DDL-357 reduced phospho-tau in brain and led to improvements in mouse performance and memory in the Barnes maze testing paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomic analysis of brain tissue from both AD models revealed changes in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal the potential of sCLU enhancement as a target for therapeutic development in AD and support the continued development of the preclinical lead candidate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:57:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9HaVRZUld0dFZGSFg4VUJHRkhaTGV3bzBySmRBUzRiekdtQTluUEtOMVFZaHk3WUV4UFFMOEtEZlpPTmF1a3NpNDlUdUN4M1dBaFpSMkh1aWV1dVlEc3M2YkhfTGJZRlk3U2ZNWTBn</guid></item><item><title>一些节育使用者数年没有经期—安全吗？ - CNN | Some birth control users go years without a period — is it safe? - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQeWRBNTZTWlhOS2I1QjFmaVJaQ3VpTzl6VDExSE9wSVc0cjBSZlhEb050OUFVRUE3RGZ0a0phTW1Sa3RnZDBUZWhlbC02QXlWUl9zVGQtOEdLMDdyS1Z3YWVtNFpxMENlY1lMeE9mZjRBbXB3Q3pGYk15NENlb291dGFlMDVNMEXSAYwBQVVfeXFMTXlBb0ZHOVJpOU5JRm5sVEVqWG5uSm9wWXJCc3gyQkh3UTJPNE5oSUk0X0pTVDdybU5FU05WdW9ST2V0UEtXclRuUGNfaE9mU2s4aGlwdHBOR1VxM25lNFp3bk9aUTNRWWcxOUdudjNocF8yb00zeTZNRkZvWHo1TXFhSVZMM3BPcTlLOXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Don’t like having your period? Hormonal birth control can be used for more than just preventing pregnancy — it’s also a popular way to go months or even years without a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/nutrition-early-menstruation-wellness"&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00023j6n529amkuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Continuous use birth control involves taking hormonal pills without what’s called a placebo week or using other methods such as an implant, ring or injections without a break. This method can end the regular bleeding associated with periods, as well as the cramps, migraines and other symptoms of menstruation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As social media becomes a hotbed for amateur medical advice and personal anecdotes, posts about getting off the pill and preventing pregnancy through nonhormonal methods rake in thousands of views daily on apps like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/getting-off-birth-control?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. As influencers share their fears about infertility and the possible harms of suppressing your body’s natural processes, reproductive experts say myths and misinformation about hormonal birth control are on the rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To understand more about the risks, rewards and science behind using birth control to forego menstruation, I had a chat with reproductive health expert Dr. Kavita Nanda. As an obstetrician-gynecologist and clinical researcher for the North Carolina-based human development nonprofit FHI 360, Nanda has spent over 25 years studying continuous use birth control and other forms of contraception.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does hormonal birth control work?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00073j6n6agm2m3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Kavita Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;Combined contraceptives use synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;together. Combination methods work to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovaries. Other methods use synthetic progesterone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;only, including pills, implants, injectables and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Both combined and progestin-only methods make the mucus in your cervix thicker, which makes it hard for sperm to enter the uterus, and the lining of your uterus also remains thin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00083j6najdzp7sj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is continuous use? And how does it differ from other methods?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00093j6nr0not83r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;The standard way to take combined contraceptives is cyclically, every day for three weeks, and then you have a break in the hormones for a week. You either don’t take a pill, or you take a placebo for a week, so you have what’s called a withdrawal bleed. The lining of the uterus sheds, and that’s what people call a “period,” although it’s really just a hormone-free withdrawal bleed. But when we talk about continuous use, you don’t take any breaks. The uterine lining stays thin and intact, and this means that users can go weeks, months or even longer, without a “period.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000a3j6n4tagypqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How long can you safely go without a monthly bleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000b3j6nmv52co2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004695.pub3/full" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; comparing continuous versus cyclical use, and it’s just as effective and just as safe. There’s no medical reason to have a period or withdrawal bleed when you’re on hormonal contraceptives. As long as you don’t have any contraindications (medical conditions) for the birth control pill, you don’t have contraindications for the continuous use of the pill.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000c3j6nfvhb7bt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, before contraception, women didn’t necessarily bleed all the time, because a lot of time was spent either being pregnant or breastfeeding. In both of those conditions, there’s no monthly bleeding, often for months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000d3j6nng331tw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, if you’re not pregnant or breastfeeding, you’re not on hormonal contraception, and you don’t have a monthly period — that’s something you do need to discuss with your provider, because that could signal an issue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are there any side effects specific to continuous use?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000f3j6nni0c1shu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;The side effects in general are similar to those with cyclical use. For example, you might have nausea, breast tenderness and headaches (at any time). With continuous use, some people experience unexpected breakthrough bleeding or spotting, especially initially, but this usually improves over time, and many people do achieve amenorrhea or (the) cessation of menses. For some people, it may take three to four months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000g3j6nwngmmro1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does continuous use affect fertility after stopping?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no evidence that long-term use of hormonal contraception — whether it’s combined hormonal interception, taken continuously or cyclically — causes infertility, and fertility typically returns within a month or two. Basically, once you stop, the (synthetic) hormones go away very quickly from the blood, ovulation is no longer suppressed, your normal estrogen and progesterone production resume. Assuming that you had normal menstrual cycles before, they would resume. (One exception is) if you’re taking something like the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10335688/#:~:text=The%20proportion%20of%20fertility%20return%20among%20pregnant%20women%20who%20used,100%25%20and%2097.8%25%20respectively." target="_blank"&gt;Depo Provera contraceptive injection&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t cause infertility, but it may take longer for fertility to return after injections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000i3j6n6mz3kz4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why were placebo pills invented if there’s no harm in skipping them?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;When the combined oral contraceptive pill was developed in the 1950s, the now-standard 21 days of active pills followed by a seven-day hormone-free interval was not based on medical necessity, but rather on cultural and strategic reasons. At the time, there was a widely held belief that menstruating every 28 days was a sign of normal female reproductive function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000k3j6nkw075xiy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To align with that expectation, the regimen was designed to mimic a natural menstrual cycle, with a monthly withdrawal bleed intended to reassure both users and physicians that they were not pregnant — important in an era before home pregnancy tests were readily available — and, at the time, to help ease religious and societal resistance to contraception.

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s really a personal preference and a discussion between a person and their provider. Someone might not want to have a period for years, or some people prefer to bleed three times a year. Some people feel reassured by monthly bleeding. Continuous use may be especially helpful for people who have painful periods, heavy periods, endometriosis, migraines, iron-deficiency anemia, physical or intellectual disabilities, and transgender individuals.

Researchers found that people with HSV-1 were 80% more likely to have Alzheimer’s, while those treated with antiviral medications had a 17% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with other evidence that HSV-1 may trigger inflammation and amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain, hallmarks of Alzheimer’s pathology. Although the study is observational and can’t prove causation, it highlights the potential for antiviral therapy as a protective strategy and urges greater public health focus on herpes virus prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80% Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; People with HSV-1 were significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antiviral Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; HSV-1 patients who took antiviral drugs had a 17% lower Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Link:&lt;/strong&gt; HSV-1 may drive brain inflammation and amyloid buildup, contributing to dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BMJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptomatic infection with the virus responsible for cold sores around the mouth–herpes simplex 1, or HSV-1 for short—may have a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, suggests a large pharma industry-funded US study published in the open access journal &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But treatment with antiviral therapy seems to be linked to a lower risk of this type of dementia, suggesting that treatment to quell HSV-1 symptoms may be protective, the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110212"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of those with Alzheimer’s disease were women. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, around 35.6 million people worldwide live with dementia, and 7.7million new cases are diagnosed every year, say the researchers. Alzheimer’s disease comprises 60%–80% of all dementias, with total costs for its treatment reaching US$305 billion in 2020, they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various infectious agents have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, and the most studied of these is HSV-1, which affected more than two-thirds of under 50s around the globe in 2016 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To shed further light on the mooted role of HSV-1 in Alzheimer’s disease and the potential protective effects of antiherpetic drugs, the researchers drew on a large set of US administrative claims data (IQVIA PharMetrics Plus) for the period 2006-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease were matched for age, sex, geographical region, database entry year, and number of healthcare visits with those without any history of neurological disease, resulting in a total of 344,628 case–control pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of those with Alzheimer’s disease were women. Their average age was 73 and they tended to have more co-existing conditions—all risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, 1507 (just under 0.5%) people with Alzheimer’s disease had been diagnosed with HSV-1 (0.44%) compared with 823 (just under 0.25%) of those in the comparison (control) group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the risk of Alzheimer’s disease rose in tandem with age. But, overall, the likelihood of an HSV-1 diagnosis was 80% higher among those with Alzheimer’s disease, after adjusting for potentially influential factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 2330 people with a history of HSV-1 infection, 931 (40%) used antiherpetic medication after their diagnosis. And they were 17% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those who didn’t use these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at the potential role of other herpes viruses, including HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. Both HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus infections were also associated with a heightened risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how HSV-1 and other neurotropic viruses might heighten the risk of dementia isn’t clear, point out the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, studies have shown that inflammatory alterations in the brain caused by HSV infection are pivotal in [Alzheimer’s disease] development,” they explain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been reported that Aβ peptides are deposited in response to HSV infection and protect host cells by blocking viral fusion with the plasma membrane, pointing to HSV as a potential risk factor for [Alzheimer’s disease]. Consistently, Aβ exhibits antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including HSV-1,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSV-1 DNA is also found in the plaques characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, and people carrying the ApoE ε4 allele, the most common genetic risk factor for the disease, are more susceptible to HSV infections, they note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that HSV-1 infections before the patient’s inclusion in the database weren’t known, added to which many people with the infection don’t have symptoms, while others might not seek treatment when they do–all factors that might influence the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their findings are in line with those of other studies. And they suggest: “While the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, these results are indicative of a possible role for antiherpetic therapy in mitigating dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they conclude: “These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpes viruses as a public health priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this virology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c515958555d4e59505d485553524f7c5e5156125f5351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emma Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmj.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emma Dickinson – BMJ&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:26:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBIZU80b2Jfa3Y5ek5ROHg0d2ZBS0F3S1I4SDByVmdQX0Y3QmJfblNkR0xBZE53dlktRDMyMHVpdDhwVDRyZy1nYWcwS0RKTWVSdGR5clhKSF82ajZVMUxoRGthcjczeF82TzA5azVjRQ</guid></item><item><title>这些餐厅的食物对我的肠道有什么影响？ -《西雅图时报》 | What has all this restaurant food done to my gut? - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What has all this restaurant food done to my gut?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lscWR2OERSR3JfOEVJMml3UUV5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:19:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB</guid></item><item><title>产后精神病可能在家庭中流行-神经科学新闻 | Postpartum Psychosis May Run in Families - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PQklzNjN4X3pvelN3aWVqN0g3YzNaWDAwVXE5Yi1rZ3l1aklENy05Sk9TQkRvakNpd2dVNHJ1TG1NdC1TWWhScmVDTkZYVWU0RmIyWmM0V1U0OWd5VVpMTG9BSXRUenYyY1VZNDhmblVaUFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Women are over 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if their sister has experienced the condition, according to a major study of more than 1.6 million women. This rare but severe disorder, marked by hallucinations, paranoia, and disorganized thinking after childbirth, can have life-threatening consequences if not treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight a strong familial risk, particularly when bipolar disorder is also present, underscoring the need for early screening and increased awareness. While the relative risk is high, the actual risk remains low, at 1.6%, but understanding family history could allow for preventive interventions and targeted mental health support during the vulnerable postpartum period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Familial Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Having a sister with postpartum psychosis raises a woman’s risk more than tenfold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bipolar Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The risk increases to 14x if the sister also has bipolar disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite its severity, postpartum psychosis remains understudied and underdiagnosed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Sinai researchers have found for the first time that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had experienced the condition, compared to a woman with a sister who did not. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which were published May 19 in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; and highlighted at the American Psychiatric Association’s annual meeting press briefing the same day, suggest both genetic and shared environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postpartum psychosis is a rare but serious mental illness that leaves a devastating impact on mothers in the vulnerable weeks and months after childbirth. It carries increased risk of suicide and infanticide if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the early warning signs of postpartum psychosis are severe mood swings, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, insomnia, paranoia, and thoughts of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the devastating ramifications of the disorder, it remains vastly understudied and a challenge for physicians to diagnose and address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every woman of childbearing age and their physicians need to know about the existence of, severity, symptoms, and familial risk for postpartum psychosis so it can be promptly diagnosed and, hopefully, prevented,” said Veerle Bergink, MD, PhD, Director of the Women’s Mental Health Center at Mount Sinai and co-senior author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At present, too many women at higher risk don’t know it and are left on their own with a new baby and no support. We hope these study findings will help move the needle and impart change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, we can implement changes to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mount Sinai study team examined the records of more than 1.6 million women from the Swedish nationwide registries, identifying 2,514 women who had experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to finding that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had the condition, the Swedish registry study showed that the presence of bipolar disorder in a sister doubles the woman’s risk of developing postpartum psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with a sister who has bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis were shown to be at highest risk; their risk for developing postpartum psychosis themselves is 14 times increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured relative recurrent risk for the disorder, which implies increased likelihood of its appearance in another member of the family. This differs from actual risk, which refers to the probability of developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers learned that while the relative risk of postpartum psychosis is quite high in full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sister is still low at 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings support the view that even though there is overlap between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder, these are in fact, distinct conditions,” said Dr. Bergink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this new data will help move the needle and impart change. With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, measures can and should be taken to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond expanding awareness around postpartum psychosis, this study provides a solid foundation for the next step of research, aimed at early recognition and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work that involves identifying the genes responsible for this disease is already underway at Mount Sinai in the lab of Behrang Mahjani, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re using complex molecular data to investigate the genetic architecture of the disease,” says Dr. Mahjani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing what specific genes are involved will help us dive into the mechanisms and triggers of postpartum psychosis, and if they’re hormone- or immune-related. And that, in turn, could lead us to novel treatments and ways to proactively inform women of their risk before they’re faced with a severe health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this postpartum psychosis and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e0858c899a8182859488ce848f978c898e87a08d8f958e9493898e8189ce8f9287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Dowling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mountsinai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elizabeth Dowling – Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Veerle Bergink. &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postpartum psychosis is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. Although genetic factors contribute to the risk of postpartum psychosis, the extent of familial risk remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared relative recurrence risk across different family relationship types, hypothesizing that relative recurrence risk for postpartum psychosis varies by degree of genetic relatedness and is higher in female full siblings than in cousins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cohort study consisted of 1,648,759 women from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,514 (0.15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within 3 months of their first-ever childbirth. The authors estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for female full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 10.69 (95% CI=6.60, 16.26) when adjusted for year of and age at childbirth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1.78, 95% CI=0.70, 3.62).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the higher familial risk of postpartum psychosis among full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sibling was relatively low, estimated at 1.60% within the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observed increased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings suggests both genetic and shared environmental influences. However, the lack of significant results in cousins hampers a more accurate distinction between these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite increased relative recurrence risk in siblings, their overall likelihood of developing postpartum psychosis remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscores the need for further research to better understand the intricate interplay of genetics and shared environment in the development of postpartum psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 12:59:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PQklzNjN4X3pvelN3aWVqN0g3YzNaWDAwVXE5Yi1rZ3l1aklENy05Sk9TQkRvakNpd2dVNHJ1TG1NdC1TWWhScmVDTkZYVWU0RmIyWmM0V1U0OWd5VVpMTG9BSXRUenYyY1VZNDhmblVaUFU</guid></item><item><title>视频： Golden Retriever Puppy认为吹风机是他的死敌- AOL.com | Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Thinks Hair Dryer Is His Mortal Enemy - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5TZXBSWldkdmhLOEVTaVp2UlRjSTNlS0U4THl6RzJpeWhNNF9SeHM4QzdmSElBZXoxQS1FdFhoZHJvYWJIdWhMMkZrbnllVXNFRWoxbFFaTGJlTjVQUmM5R284NlVjYlZadGc1a0lvV2QzOGJRSkxHOTJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(Photo Credit: @maui_thegoldenpup / Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To us, a hair dryer is just part of a normal grooming routine.

Many pet parents have witnessed their furry companions react with suspicion or full-on panic to household items. Now, one hilarious &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ0c3wzp62z/?igsh=MWpoejRxMW1kMzBzeQ==" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; captures a Golden Retriever puppy who is absolutely convinced the hair dryer is a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retriever puppy thinks hair dryer is out to get him in funny video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared by Instagram user @maui_thegoldenpup, the video features a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy named Hugo who is clearly not a fan of post-bath blow drying. The clip begins with Hugo sitting calmly on his owner’s lap as she attempts to dry him off with a hair dryer after a bath. However, within seconds, the calm turns into panic. He starts flinching, then squirms out of her arms and makes a quick getaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the onscreen text, the owner was caught off guard by Hugo’s reaction. She mentioned that he seemed fine at first, but his discomfort escalated quickly. On a second attempt during another bath, Hugo had the same distressed reaction. Although the hair dryer was set to “no heat” and “low air,” Hugo wanted nothing to do with it. Meanwhile, a towel proved to be a much more acceptable drying method for the sensitive pup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Hugo’s curiosity occasionally got the better of him, and he would sniff the dryer, only to panic again when switched on. His owner also noted that her two other dogs, Maui and Ruby, had never been bothered by the hair dryer as puppies, making Hugo’s reaction even more unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your dog is scared of a hair dryer, there are gentler ways to help them dry off. Toweling them thoroughly is a good first step, and some dogs may prefer absorbent microfiber towels designed specifically for pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If using a dryer is necessary, consider a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/products/175089-corded-vs-cordless-vacuums" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pet-specific model;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pet-specific model&lt;/a&gt; that is quieter and has adjustable heat and speed settings. Always start at a distance, and allow your dog to sniff the device while it is switched off. Gradually desensitizing them with short, low-pressure sessions can also help build comfort over time. Most importantly, be patient and let your dog set the pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/177125-golden-retriever-puppy-hair-dryer-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Thinks Hair Dryer Is His Mortal Enemy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Thinks Hair Dryer Is His Mortal Enemy&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 12:43:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5TZXBSWldkdmhLOEVTaVp2UlRjSTNlS0U4THl6RzJpeWhNNF9SeHM4QzdmSElBZXoxQS1FdFhoZHJvYWJIdWhMMkZrbnllVXNFRWoxbFFaTGJlTjVQUmM5R284NlVjYlZadGc1a0lvV2QzOGJRSkxHOTJR</guid></item><item><title>不是医生，但可能是结束70 ％癌症死亡的人-这一切都始于一个小实验室-银河日报 | Not a Doctor, But Possibly the Man Who Will End 70% of Cancer Deaths — And It All Started in a Small Lab - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxOUlFqUWtoY0RRMmRJOV9qMFRwQ25leUYxeHh0dzFjOHRnd2otWWl4Z2pzRnhFQXNfM0lFR0kwR2hPYzJTU21fM3F3VldJM0RhVHJUeGQ4V0xQSjJuc0w2RjhlSUpOM0t1MVJBdnpxcDZzMy0xajhTSmpvUjZ5azQtQVZzcG5IWmdIaHpDMm5KNEVILVpBTjV5enEwUW53NUZlZ3YzTzVoMmkyT3Zwblo0WEVDeHpFeFR6Tm94VHJheXp6T0pSMWJFcjRoZ09zZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small lab at the heart of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institut Curie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Paris, French chemist &lt;strong&gt;Raphaël Rodriguez&lt;/strong&gt; is working on what could become one of the most significant medical breakthroughs in the fight against &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. While he may have failed his first year of medical school, Rodriguez never abandoned his ambition to save lives. Today, he is leading a team that has discovered a &lt;strong&gt;weakness &lt;/strong&gt;in the biological mechanisms driving &lt;strong&gt;metastasis&lt;/strong&gt;, the process by which cancer spreads through the body—responsible for nearly &lt;strong&gt;70 percent of cancer-related deaths&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Turning the Immune System Against Metastases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez’s research focuses on a specific group of cells in the &lt;strong&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; known as &lt;strong&gt;macrophages&lt;/strong&gt;. Under normal conditions, these cells help protect the body by attacking harmful invaders. But in the presence of cancer, some macrophages undergo a transformation. &lt;a href="https://institut-curie.org/news/new-class-molecules-against-cancer-cells-refractory-standard-treatments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;According to Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;, they begin to “adopt a program that helps tumor cells migrate and invade new tissues,” effectively becoming accomplices in the spread of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This transformation is not just behavioral, but &lt;strong&gt;metabolic&lt;/strong&gt;. The team discovered that these &lt;strong&gt;pro-tumor macrophages &lt;/strong&gt;shift their internal processes in a way that supports cancer progression. This insight allowed Rodriguez and his colleagues to design a molecule that can interfere with that specific metabolic switch. By targeting these rogue macrophages, the molecule works to reverse their role in supporting metastasis without damaging other healthy immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

The activation of lysosomal iron by a phospholipid degrader causes the oxidation and rupture of cell membranes, leading to cell death.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Path in Cancer Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez developed this molecule in collaboration with researchers across multiple disciplines, including chemistry, cell biology, and immunology. Preclinical trials using mice have shown that the molecule not only inhibits the macrophages’ transformation but also &lt;strong&gt;slows the development of metastatic tumors&lt;/strong&gt;. This multi-step approach opens a path toward treatments that don’t just fight the primary tumor but stop cancer from spreading altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this work have attracted attention from major pharmaceutical groups and cancer research institutions worldwide. Rodriguez is now preparing for the next stage: bringing this molecule into &lt;strong&gt;clinical testing&lt;/strong&gt;. Although that process is lengthy and complex, his results have already generated significant interest in the scientific community. His work is being closely followed, especially as the fight against metastasis remains one of the most pressing challenges in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From his lab at &lt;em&gt;Institut Curie&lt;/em&gt;, one of Europe’s leading centers for cancer research, Rodriguez continues refining his approach. He works alongside a multidisciplinary team determined to turn the tide on one of cancer’s most elusive and deadly traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

Chicken breast (5th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 10 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 400 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 2 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is another lean option, but it can be a bit bland, so bump up the flavor with herbs, mustard or crunchy veggies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Roast Beef (3rd most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 17 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 350 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 2 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leanest and lowest-sodium choice of the red meat options, it’s a solid pick if you’re craving red meat without going for richer options like capicola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Honey Ham (2nd most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 10 g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 570 mg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 2.5 g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is still relatively lean, but as the name suggests, honey ham contains 2-3 grams of sugar per serving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Keep an eye on sodium — check a few different brands and choose the one with the lowest sodium option,” Villaseca advised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Pastrami (8th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 604 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 3.3 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pastrami is flavorful and protein-rich, but comes with a bump in fat and sodium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Corned Beef (4th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 15 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 765 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 8 g (including 3 g saturated fat)&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cut from the leaner part of the brisket, corned beef is high in protein, but it’s also one of the saltiest options. It’s b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;est saved for the occasional Reuben.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. Capicola (9th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 10 g &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 540 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 12 g &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capicola is more of a charcuterie star than a basic sandwich filler. It’s a traditional Italian cured meat (like prosciutto) that’s been dry-cured and aged rather than cooked. Its high fat content and marbling give it a chewy texture and rich flavor, making it the perfect pair for crackers, cheese and other cured meats, rather than as a standard deli slice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. Sopressata (least popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 960 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 14 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you love it for snack plates, just balance it out with fiber-rich sides like whole grain crackers, fruit, or nuts,” Villaseca recommended. “It’s all about the big picture.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. Salami (6th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 995 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat:18 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a long shelf life and being portable, salami is handy for hikes or road trips. Pair with hydrating fruits like oranges or apples if you’re eating it on the go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;10. Bologna (7th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 7 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 750 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 16 g &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bologna is lower in protein and higher in fat and sodium than other options. “It’s often one of the more affordable choices, which is important to acknowledge,” said Farrell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

They find new ways to maintain social relevance — often by doing things older generations don’t understand. (Don’t believe me? Just try to guess what any of their slang terms mean.) One of the latest teen trends is something that might raise a few eyebrows among parents, due to safety and privacy concerns: location tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although teens crave independence from their parents, they are voluntarily sharing their real-time whereabouts with their friends.

Later, they “checked in” to places on Foursquare and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, shared real-time updates on Snapchat and Instagram stories, and tweeted every detail of their lives. Now, they use Snapchat’s Snap Map, Life360, or Apple’s location sharing to share with their friends everywhere they are in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This isn’t new,” Caswell said. “In a world where nearly everything is shared, this doesn’t feel invasive to teens — it feels normal. It’s just another way they stay looped into each other’s lives.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teens also use apps like this to track their parents, according to Caswell, whose own daughter will text her if she sees her mom is at Ulta and ask for lip gloss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For many teens, location sharing is about connection and a sense of safety,” Caswell explained. “It’s their way of saying, ‘You’re in my circle’ and ‘I’ve got your back.’” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding The Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though sharing your location with friends might be popular, it doesn’t come without consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evolutiontohealing.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cheryl Groskopf, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68222bd5e4b09ed53250130c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.evolutiontohealing.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheryl Groskopf, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;an anxiety, trauma, and attachment therapist based in Los Angeles, sees teens sharing their locations as a way “to manage anxiety, track social dynamics and feel less alone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s comfort in knowing where your people are, especially in a world where teens constantly feel like they could get left out, replaced or excluded,” she said. “But that comfort is fragile — it relies on constant access (which leaves their nervous system hypervigilant to feeling ‘left out’).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“Location sharing can intensify FOMO (fear of missing out) and social exclusion,” said Dr. Cameron Caswell, an adolescent psychologist.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you’re checking someone’s location because you don’t trust what they’re telling you — or because they don’t trust you — then it’s already crossed into a control dynamic,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groskopf &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her practice, she’s seen teens “spiral” when they spot their friend at a party they weren’t invited to, or “because someone didn’t respond fast enough, but ‘was clearly at home.’” She explained, “It becomes a setup for overthinking, panic and social surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Teens shouldn’t use location sharing when it’s being used to avoid rejection, manage someone else’s anxiety, or prove loyalty,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McInnis said, “Teens sharing their location and having their friends track them could harm their mental health.” Constantly seeing (and comparing) your friends’ social activities “can lead to feelings of inadequacy,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caswell agreed. “Location sharing can intensify FOMO (fear of missing out) and social exclusion,” she said. “Seeing a group of friends hanging out without them — even unintentionally — can make them feel lonelier and more left out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to these emotional risks, there are physical risks, too. Like a teen’s location data being available to someone who might wish them harm. “In the wrong hands, it can make [teens] more vulnerable to stalking, harassment or even predatory behavior, especially if they are in controlling relationships,” Caswell said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s A Gender Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teen girls may be more likely to use location sharing as a way to feel safer. According to the Life360 survey, 70% of Gen Z women believe their physical well-being benefits from location sharing. In the field, our experts also found that females were more likely to do this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caswell said that “mostly girls” will openly share their location with friends, “both for fun and because it makes them feel safer knowing someone always knows where they are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this sense of safety is a double-edged sword, as it can “increase the risk of stalking, harassment or even sexual violence,” Caswell said. “Especially when their location is shared with the wrong person, which is often someone they know and trust.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groskopf warns of the dangers girls and femme teens may experience when their use of location-sharing is weaponized against them. “It can easily turn into emotional surveillance disguised as closeness,” she explained. (For example, a friend or partner telling them, “If you trust me, you’ll let me see where you are.”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I see these kinds of patterns play out in high-control dynamics — friends or partners checking locations not to stay safe, but to manage anxiety, jealousy or power,” Groskopf said. “And girls are way more likely to internalize that and comply, even when it feels off. They’re more likely to be conditioned to avoid conflict, manage other people’s emotions, and keep the peace — even if that means overriding their own boundaries.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why teaching your kids how to set boundaries, in real life and online, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teaching your teen how to handle location-sharing in a safe way starts with conversations around consent and the ability to say no.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When asked if there is a safe way for teens to share their locations, Groskopf said, “Only if there’s real consent, boundaries, and the freedom to opt out without punishment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this case, the punishment could be feeling guilt-tripped or rejected by a friend. “That means not just technically having the option to stop sharing, but knowing you won’t be guilted, shut out, or shamed if you do,” Groskopf continued. “A parent saying, ‘I want to know where you are in case of emergency’ is one thing. A friend saying, ‘Why’d you turn off your location?’ with passive-aggressive silence afterward is something else entirely.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added, “Safe tracking only works when it’s not being weaponized to regulate someone else’s fear, jealousy or insecurity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Talk To Your Teen About Location Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start the conversation with curiosity, not criticism, Caswell said. “Instead of banning [location sharing], I recommend walking through privacy settings together and having calm conversations about why they’re sharing in the first place,” she said. “Is it for safety? To feel connected to their bestie? Because they feel pressured to? Helping teens understand why they are doing it makes location sharing a lot safer and more intentional.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From there, encourage your teen to only share their location with “a small, trusted circle of close friends or family,” and check in on this list frequently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One mom I worked with told me her daughter was shocked to find an ex-boyfriend still had access to her location,” Caswell said. “Of course, that explained why he kept ‘randomly’ showing up wherever she was. Instead of freaking out, the mom used it as an opportunity to talk with her daughter about how to use tech more safely moving forward.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s always a good idea to talk with your teens about how to stay safe online and set boundaries around privacy with their friends. But keep in mind, this starts at home. “Let your teen say no to you sometimes,” Caswell suggested. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Dental hygienists notice worn teeth, microfractures and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can see stress in their jaw, whether they clench or grind, thanks to wear facets, chipped teeth or enlarged jaw muscles,” Auger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Have A Sleep Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a dental hygienist, there are several signs in the mouth that may indicate sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea,” Glauz said. “These include a scalloped tongue, enlarged tonsils or uvula, a high, narrow palate, frequent mouth breathing or snoring and signs of tooth grinding, [aka] bruxism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there’s excessive wear on particular surfaces or areas of the teeth, that can reflect certain sleep patterns or issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While a diagnosis must come from a medical provider, these oral indicators can be important clues that prompt further evaluation and help connect patients to the care they need,” Glauz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tobacco use, whether it’s smoking or vaping, shows up in the mouth too,” Ferjuste said. “Staining, gum recession and a higher risk for oral cancer are all red flags we look for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, drug use can have a noticeable impact on the teeth and mouth. Certain drugs, for instance, can cause dry mouth or become very acidic in the mouth, thus eroding tooth enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: bluecinema via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;bluecinema via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Certain lifestyle habits and behaviors have a visible impact on your teeth.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You’ve Struggled With Acid Reflux Or Bulimia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients that have acidic reflux or suffer from bulimia often have signs of erosion,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/kmc.smiles/?hl=en" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kari Carter-Cherelus" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681a8654e4b0c2b15d969f84" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/kmc.smiles/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Kari Carter-Cherelus&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dental hygienist. “Basically, the acid eats the enamel off of the back of their teeth, exposing softer layers of tooth structure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thin enamel can indicate chronic vomiting, acid reflux or frequent consumption of particularly acidic foods and drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The back surfaces of the upper front teeth is where stomach acid tends to make contact,” Glauz said. “This can lead to teeth that appear smooth, shiny or thinner than normal.

Hvenegaard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Changes in the climate are the likely cause, with Hvenegaard stating: "If climate change alters when and where the birds can get resources during their annual travels, it could add to a decrease in their population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bird's population has already seen a 53% drop over the past 50 years due to pesticide use and changing habitats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why are shifting migration patterns important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The least flycatcher is an important insect-eater in its ecosystem, and it also serves as a food source for other animals such as hawks, owls, and squirrels.

So, with colleagues, he spent more than six years sequencing the genomes of about 1,400 people in their 80s or older with no major chronic diseases.

Synthesizing hundreds of studies about health, disease and aging, his book talks about a future where advanced drugs, biochemistry and artificial intelligence should allow us to turn back the clock and slow how rapidly we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="URRLUOKUIBDG7GL3PE7MRHSJSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Already, he says, we can dramatically increase our chances of becoming super agers with a few lifestyle tweaks, such as eating better (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/01/02/ultra-processed-foods-identification/" target="_blank"&gt;avoid processed foods&lt;/a&gt;) and sleeping enough (seven hours is good).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GYWEURRXZ5EHJFNGRFX2L475A4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there’s one lifestyle change, he says, that influences aging far more than any other. It also has altered his own life the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YYTMO3TNXNB67JWEUQUKH6QQSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To learn more, I talked with Topol, 70, about what he’s doing to become a super ager and how the rest of us can do the same. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U3YCBWDTZNCLPH5RATVNJVD644" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;So, what is the single most important lifestyle change people can make to age better?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FLUWWTA5PNHOBMJ6ECT7RZZNYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of all the things we know about, the one that rises to the very top is exercise. In fact, it’s the only intervention in people that has shown any effect on slowing the body-wide aging clock, meaning it appears to change how rapidly we age. Of course, other lifestyle factors, like diet and social interactions, are critically important. But if there is one thing that has the most exceptional evidence for healthy aging, it’s exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WXXUHMAG4BHJBEXVDTOR6MJUDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For decades, as a cardiologist, I would always be emphasizing aerobic exercise to my patients, whether that was walking or bicycling or swimming or elliptical or you name it. I’d say to get at least 30 minutes most days. And that’s what I did myself. I didn’t really accept the importance of strength training until I began researching the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JTKNCXIFUNGCTN3GHYCK5INHOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I saw all the evidence, I became totally convinced. Resistance training and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/18/grip-strength-muscles-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;grip strength&lt;/a&gt; have extraordinary correlations with healthy aging. And so, well over a year ago, I went from being pretty much a weakling — I never worked on any muscles, except my legs, from doing lots of bicycling and hiking and walking — to now I’m stronger than I’ve ever been in my life, and it’s just been terrific. I’ve got better balance and posture, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YNGPY56FTJB2RD7DJZ2PHJ5OAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s your strength training routine like? Do you work with a trainer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGQX4HLDNVDXXNMDKTUFBNNSBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Well, I didn’t want to hurt myself and I was definitely a beginner, so I did start off with a trainer a couple of times a week. But now it’s only about once a month. And I tell people, you don’t have to have a trainer. You can find good information about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/strength-training-gym-workout/" target="_blank"&gt;getting started online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZZIIO7XNUNAGFNLSLSNNTHTACY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you work out at a gym or at home?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4S5VJXFWMVERLGXMC2CVIUMRPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I do it all at home. It saves time and expense. I tell my patients, the more convenient and practical your training is, the more likely it is to get done, and that sure works for me. I usually do &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/" target="_blank"&gt;planks, lunges, squats,&lt;/a&gt; sit-ups on a medicine ball, the &lt;a href="https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/16/cobra/?srsltid=AfmBOor7DCjIuV5QS3oUEUpBWisLK6Qqrd72YVg7GOPcZbmgz3hdA6fI" target="_blank"&gt;cobra&lt;/a&gt;, and a bunch of other floor exercises. I also use resistance bands. And I’ve learned about the importance of things like balance,&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24978931/" target="_blank"&gt; standing &lt;/a&gt;on a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiuYyJOikPE" target="_blank"&gt;foam&lt;/a&gt; pad, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMH7LEZSVFH53GWS4HGM2654HY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yes, I do. I also try to touch my shin while standing on one foot. All of this, the strength training, the balance, the rest, it’s made me feel so &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/fitness-test-by-age-exercise/" target="_blank"&gt;strong and fit&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like I should have done this decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OINYFCZLHJFJ7HFSVFUKAWWPQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it ever too late to start doing this kind of training?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZJ35C7XXOVCBJB6P2JXDUZ5WSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Absolutely not. It’s never too late. This idea that you can’t build muscle or strength as you age is silly. No matter what your age, and I’m not young anymore, you’re fully capable of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/29/weight-lifting-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;getting stronger and athletically fit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A5P643CSXBFTDOV4DF6CMIAMZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;You still do aerobic exercise?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WE4ECBJLZJEJNP5MRRUCYV4LJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course. I used to do aerobics six out of seven days a week, for 30, sometimes 40 minutes. Now I do aerobics about four times a week and integrate the resistance training the other days. And sometimes I do both. But it’s still less than an hour. I don’t have enough time to do more and that’s an important point. When I talk to my patients about exercise, we get into the details of their lives. They’re working. They’re tired. So we talk about when they can fit in time for exercise. Do they have a lunch break? Maybe they can go for a brisk walk. Or do lunges at home later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PJ3C3LREFBDJBBTRXJZ3LJBA2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the book, you talk about how being outside and being with other people are both important for healthy aging. What about exercising outside with some friends?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CVI6MZSN45EUBOIIXSTVV5HUPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Oh, yeah, that’s great. The data suggests that, as we get older, we tend to become recluses. And that’s not good for healthy aging. And being in nature — I never would have thought that would be important for health. But the data are strong. If you can be outside moving around in nature with friends, that’s a twofer, a threefer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YPQ24C7XBBUBFIJ6NIPQ3UNLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the endgame here? It’s not just living longer, right?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XSKZ25UFVFAVJGYLIFYOJB3TSQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No, not at all. The goal is extending our healthspan, our years of life that are without the major age-related diseases, especially cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. What we can see from studies is that you can get seven to 10 years of extra healthy aging from lifestyle factors, especially exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66YBDO2GJRAGFNP5QKJKFJEI5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What age do you want to live to?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WE37TD4KLRCENIPSWPBRXKEXNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Well, I don’t have any of the age-related diseases yet. So, as long as that goes on, I’d be happy to get well into my 80s and beyond. I’d say that if you’re 85 and you don’t have any of those diseases, you’ve hit the jackpot. I’m doing my best to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJCSBX3EJZEXHDPDBGOTAQKI3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a fitness question?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6gj000x3b7724jx3mip@published"&gt;My boyfriend has been having a series of rolling health issues that require emergency room trips, which is awful. But the worst thing is how he acts when he’s there: He doesn’t ask questions, push for care, or remind the medical staff that he’s alive. He had a cardiac event instead of warning the nurse about his symptoms because he worried he was “bothering” the guy who had other patients. In every ER I’ve been to, if you aren’t firm to the point of pushy, you won’t get medical care. I work two hours away, so I can’t always be there immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="229" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6iv000y3b77qosxztg2@published"&gt;I love and care for him, but I’m not his mom. Going to the doctor or the ER when things go wrong, but then not actually asking any questions or telling the doctor about his symptoms is becoming a huge problem. He’ll go home, and the problem will continue untreated, and I’ll end up driving him back to the ER when I get home, or we’ll have to make a second expensive specialist appointment because he didn’t ask for answers the first time. I can’t always be there, and honestly, navigating doctors for an adult who won’t do it for himself is the least sexy thing I can imagine. I know I need to be sympathetic because he’s sick and scared, but I’m mad. I know self-advocacy wouldn’t make him not sick, but it would help! I’m out of PTO and worried about what will happen next time he has an emergency if I can’t leave work. As a teenager, I was hospitalized alone in a foreign country where I didn’t speak the language, and broken bones/work accidents/severe asthma have sent me to ERs in the States plenty of times since. I’ve always come out metaphorically fighting. I know it sucks, but if you don’t tell people what you need in an understaffed system, you won’t get it. What can I do? Telling him to be firm isn’t helping.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6op00113b77m2eqq3cy@published"&gt;I don’t want to come off as too harsh here, so I’ll start off with an admission: I once cried because I thought my husband (then fiancé) didn’t drink enough water. He was fine. I just worried that he might one day become dehydrated. So, I totally get loving someone and wanting them to take better care of themselves. But that little breakdown over hydration concerns is now a joke in my marriage because, well, it was ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6qp00123b771ntisqrv@published"&gt;You have to remind yourself, like I did, when I realized that: This is an adult we’re talking about. You mentioned that you’re not his mom. And it doesn’t sound like he’s even complained to you or asked for help. Also, it’s not as if he has a dangerous disease and is refusing treatment. He’s going to the hospital, he’s just not being quite as assertive as you would be. That’s allowed. And it’s not an automatic death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6sp00133b77opw7jtsf@published"&gt;I think you’re right that self-advocacy and assertiveness help to get results in medical settings, but the healthy thing to do would be to share that insight with him and then just stop. Don’t push. Don’t stress. Let him make his own choices, reminding yourself that all different kinds of people with all different kinds of personalities find their way in life without your guidance. And if it feels hard to imagine washing your hands of the situation, given your love and care for him, think of it this way: At this point, you’re bossing him around and being angry and frustrated, but you’re not actually succeeding in getting him better care. So what is there to lose if you allow him to manage things on his own? If it’s partially the finances you’re worried about, he can schedule and pay for the pricey specialist follow-up visit himself.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw70c00143b77t7w1mad9@published"&gt;One last thought: I often find that when I’m really wound up about someone else not doing something the “right” way, I’m focusing on their shortcomings instead of something in my own life that needs improvement just as urgently. Consider turning your attention to yourself, and being as clear and honest about what you see as you wish your boyfriend would be with the ER doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a friend who’s from the same background as me. The thing is, I’m pretty sure he likes guys. I don’t know if there’s anyone in his life he’s opened up to about this, but I want to somehow let him know I’d be a safe person to talk to. I don’t feel like I can just ask him, as it isn’t really anyone’s business if he’s not ready to share. But it hurts to imagine that he may be suffering in silence.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgxoez001o3b775lisdafb@published"&gt;Sometimes when he says something disparaging about LGBTQ+ people, I’ll gently push back with something along the lines of “being LGBTQ+ is not the end of the world.” But I’m afraid if I were to push back any harder than that, or if I hint too much about what I suspect, I could scare him away. Sadly, I feel like there’s absolutely nothing I can do until he decides he’s ready. Am I right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgxoez001r3b77bjspxusb@published"&gt;I think you could take a harder stance than saying it’s “not the end of the world.” What about something like, “Are you serious? It’s 2025!”; “Maybe it makes me a bad [member of whatever community you’re a part of] but I’m all for people dating/loving/being attracted to/sleeping with whoever they want”; or, “I know that’s what we learned growing up but I just can’t get on board with it.” And if you’re “out” as an ally, you could use what you post and share on social media to signal that you’re not homophobic, and are not OK with LGBTQ+ people being discriminated against or otherwise mistreated.&lt;/p&gt;

Be gentle with your friend if he comes to you with less controversial admissions—like if he misses the deadline to file his taxes, doesn’t get into dental school, or tells you he has social anxiety. Make sure you encourage him to be kind to himself, normalize what he’s going through, and remind him how highly you think of him. Hopefully, if the day comes that he’s wondering, “Who could I talk to about liking guys?” you’ll pop up in his mind as someone who’s always been an open-minded, non-judgmental friend.&lt;/p&gt;

Because of my position, our teacher has asked for my input on senior leadership for next year, and so I know which students will be in what positions. This is Very Important Information to everyone in this elective, and since our teacher mentioned that I know, many people have been asking me about it. I can’t tell anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

He reported that the pain had erupted immediately after he'd stifled a sneeze by pinching his nose and closing his mouth at the same time. He was driving and contending with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/46015-hay-fever.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/46015-hay-fever.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hay fever&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; symptoms when he stifled the sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the man didn't have any trouble breathing, swallowing or talking, his doctors noticed a faint crackling sound during an initial examination of his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the doctors took an X-ray to investigate further, they found signs of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subcutaneous-emphysema?lang=gb" target="_blank" data-url="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subcutaneous-emphysema?lang=gb" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surgical emphysema&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a condition in which air gets trapped under the deepest tissue layers below the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;A CT scan then showed that a tear had formed between the third and fourth bones in the patient's neck, which enabled air to escape from his windpipe, or trachea, and into tissues of the neck and the space between the lungs. The hole in his trachea measured 0.08 by 0.08 inches (2 by 2 millimeters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors concluded that the tear likely formed due to a "rapid build-up of pressure in the trachea while sneezing with a pinched nose and closed mouth," according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/16/12/e255633" target="_blank" data-url="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/16/12/e255633" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient's medical providers determined that he didn't need surgery to repair the tear. Instead, they monitored him in the hospital for two days, carefully watching his oxygen levels and other vital signs and not providing food by mouth for the first day. He was then discharged with prescriptions for pain-relief and hay fever medications, as well as doctor's orders to avoid strenuous activity for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-oGJnXHinYzeqiecYmVJnhm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-oGJnXHinYzeqiecYmVJnhm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a checkup five weeks later, a CT scan of the man's neck showed that the tear had completely healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Spontaneous windpipe tears aren't widely reported in the medical literature, with only &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(06)00659-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(06)00659-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(13)00623-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(13)00623-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;few&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220731" target="_blank" data-url="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220731" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; documented prior to this case.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As soon as measles started spreading in West Texas, El Paso health officials began preparing schools and day care facilities for the day the virus would inevitably arrive.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But now that it's here, it’s not kids who are making up the brunt of the cases — it’s adults. Two-thirds of El Paso’s cases so far are among people over the age of 18, and only 7% are among school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Anyone unvaccinated can contract measles, but it tends to hit children first and hardest. Most children are not fully vaccinated until they are five years old and they spend more time than adults in congregate settings where the virus can spread quickly. More families of young children are opting out of vaccines, leaving them exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, followed this traditional path, starting with school-age children before spreading to adults. Almost six months into what is now &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/"&gt;the country’s largest measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; since 2000, Texas’ 722 cases are about evenly spread between the three age groups the state divides them into: under four, 5-17 and adults.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;El Paso stands out for its high rate of adult infections. The county only has 56 cases so far, the third-highest among Texas counties but still too small of a sample size to conclude much, public health experts say. But if this trend holds, it may be a credit to El Paso’s high vaccination rates among kids — 96% of kindergartners and 98% of seventh graders are fully vaccinated for measles, higher than the percent required to maintain herd immunity. The state does not track adult vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“That is one of the protective factors that we feel is helping us,” said El Paso public health authority Hector Ocaranza. “But still we’re going to continue to see cases of measles that are going to be clustering in some of the schools or day cares that have low immunization rates.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;These surprising initial statistics have required public health officials to change their outbreak response on the fly. They’re aiming more of their vaccination events specifically at adults, especially as many health care providers who serve adults do not have the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine on hand the way pediatricians do.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Most of the adults, they don’t remember whether they’ve had the MMR vaccine,” Ocaranza said. “They were kids, and nobody has a shot record.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Adults unsure of whether they were vaccinated as children can safely get another round of the shots, said Patsy Stinchfield, past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and a measles expert.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“If you did have two [shots] already, it will only make your full antibody cup even fuller,” Stinchfield said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Older adults especially should consult with their doctor about their immunization status, she said. People born before 1957 are presumed immune, since the virus was so common back then, but some people who got an early version of the vaccine between 1963 and 1967 may not have gotten the same protection as later shots.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The exceptions, she said, are people who are immunocompromised, pregnant women or the tiny minority of people who have had a bad reaction to the vaccine in the past. Those people are counting on everyone else’s vaccination status to keep them healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Healthy adults are generally able to fight off the worst of a measles infection, but anyone who gets infected runs the risk of it morphing into pneumonia or worse, said Ben Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&amp;amp;M University. Three of the five hospitalizations in El Paso so far are in adults.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;And anyone with measles will spread it in the community, potentially to children too young to be vaccinated who are especially vulnerable to the worst outcomes, like encephalitis, deafness, blindness and permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Especially kids two years and under, their immune systems are just bad at everything,” Neuman said. “We’re all sort of helping them out with our herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Neuman said it’s possible that El Paso’s high rate of adult cases is “the first sign of something weird,” but he anticipates the data will start to look more normal as more people get tested.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;El Paso borders the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where the outbreak that originated in Texas has taken hold due to the large Mennonite communities in both places. Ocaranza said measles doesn’t respect borders, and he anticipates it spreading vociferously on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico line now that it’s in El Paso.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The messaging is the same, whether it’s children or adults who are testing positive, in Mexico or the United States, he said: Get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We welcome anybody who needs the vaccine,” he said. “We can vaccinate regardless of their place of residence, regardless of their immigration status, regardless of the ability to pay … Everyone needs to join forces to stop this.”&lt;/p&gt;

I'd just been for a mid-winter run in a frozen park in the Finnish city of Oulu. The air temperature was -15C (5F). At 170km (106m) south of the Arctic Circle, this is the world's northernmost &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80r3myl990o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Parkrun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Less than an hour later, I ducked into a sauna – a dimly-lit wooden room where intense heat was radiating from a massive wood-burning stove. The thermometer read 85C (185F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As I sat there, sweating like crazy, a fellow sauna-goer threw a ladleful of water onto the stove's hot stones to make "löyly" – Finnish for a sudden burst of steam that surges through the air. It's a powerful sensation, almost shocking. The heat reached deep into my skin and muscles, melting away any tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But that wasn't enough for me. Stepping outside into the cold air, steam rose from my body, and I clambered down an ice-encrusted ladder into the excruciatingly cold water of the Oulu River, which had a temperature of around 1C (34F). I felt piercing pain, like a million needles striking my skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But I didn't jump out. Instead, I counted slowly up to 12. And after a few seconds the pain seemd to disappear – I actually felt okay with it. It was almost like an icy hug. When I clambered out, the air around me seemed almost warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To some, it might sound like the morning schedule of a deranged masochist. But this sequence of cold, hot and then cold again made me feel strangely alive. A sauna followed by an ice bath is known as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40094855/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;contrast therapy&lt;/a&gt; in sports medicine – and it feels surprisingly good. When I do it, I experience a rush of energy, which gives way to a mood of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To those outside of Finland the lurch from cold, to hot and to cold again can seem extreme, but it is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxz0vw9k6go" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;health craze&lt;/a&gt; that is now spreading beyond Scandinavian borders to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556521002916" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;other parts of the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So I wanted to delve into the science behind the Finnish sauna and find out whether it really is good for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Antti Leinonen Erika Benke, the author of this article, has been enjoying saunas combined with ice plunges for years (Credit: Antti Leinonen)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Antti Leinonen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Erika Benke, the author of this article, has been enjoying saunas combined with ice plunges for years (Credit: Antti Leinonen)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Finns go to the sauna at least once a week and spend between five to 30 minutes in about 80–100C (176-212F) heat," says Heikki Junkkari, a doctor who sits on the board of the Finnish Sauna Society, an organisation that has promoted Finnish sauna culture since 1937.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are an estimated &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-43414145" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;3.3 million saunas&lt;/a&gt;  in this country of 5.5 million people, meaning they are accessible to almost everyone.

Men who took part in two to three sauna sessions a week had a 20% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and 22% lower risk of dementia than those who only took one weekly sauna. The effect was enhanced the more frequent the sauna use was, with a 66% reduction in dementia and 65% in Alzheimer's disease among those who used a sauna between four and seven times per week, compared with those who only used the sauna once per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study did not, however, compare the effects of a sauna against the risk in men who did not use saunas at all and so the results may also reflect something more generally about the lifestyles of people who have time to indulge in sauna bathing in the first place.  It is also worth remembering such observational results do not necessarily mean a direct cause and effect relationship between saunas and dementia. Instead it provides a glimpse at an effect that warrants further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Sauna played a key role helping us find peace, giving rhythm to our lives – Juha Mieto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Anecdotal reports of psychological benefits associated with sauna use include that of Juha Mieto, a well-known Finnish cross-country skier.

"Sauna is a space where our norms and conventions are temporarily suspended – we take off our clothes, sit in close proximity, and endure extremes together," she says. "These are great, ritual environments for our identities to transform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sauna therapist Laura Foon says the warm, calm atmosphere induces a sense of relaxation. "Today, we're constantly on high alert," she says. "Diving into soothing darkness in the sauna is profoundly healing." It is like returning to the womb, she suggests. The sauna is a reassuringly safe space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But what about when you skip out of the sauna and plunge yourself into a lake shrouded in ice?

&lt;p class="block"&gt;Last Thursday, May 15, Sachem High School East Principal Lou Antonetti sent a letter home to the 123 people who the district believed had extended contact with the infected individual who had an active case of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"We are contacting you because we have reason to believe that you had contact with this individual during the time (s)he was infectious," Antonetti wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;On Monday, May 19, the district provided a free skin test to those potentially exposed. The district also offered the option for students and staff to go to their doctors for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Suffolk County Health Department spokesperson said the agency could not disclose how many of the 123 people were tested at the school versus privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“It was only one student anyway that had it, and everybody is being tested, so I’m not worried about it," Holtsville resident Lisa Russo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Others said they were concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"What's being done to ensure the safety of the kids when we, as parents or guardians, send them to school?" Farmingville resident Janie Gallo asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The tests take two days to show results. According to district officials, the test results will be evaluated at the high school today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Testing will be done again in July after a 2-month incubation period has elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Tuberculosis is a potentially serious infectious disease caused by bacteria. It primarily affects the lungs and causes a persistent cough and chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The bacteria are easily spread through the air when actively sick people cough, sneeze or speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“I’ve had TB before, so you can fight it," Farmingville resident Anton Kovary said. "You can overcome any kind of disease you have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the state health department, there were 1,089 total statewide tuberculosis cases last year, including 48 in Nassau County and 52 in Suffolk County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 09:12:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQTlVUemFVajRKTWlFT0hmYlhJTC04d2N3ZTVEQVpEbWlSN001Y2JVUTMxSGgyUzNkdHR1eVZyb2Y2V2NEN0pxSkZVS09jcFM2Y1VrY1BoYW1LVmc1cWhtWHFRQl9ZaEpLcmNBRDBVOUdGOURCUmM1QktKbnNHeVRFdlJpdC1nTU9XWG1tdTVIR2ZxLUlTTTJDN183N2llTWpFM2NR</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州的父母通过加大疫苗接种力度来对抗麻疹疫情- NBC新闻 | A surge of Texas parents fought measles outbreak by stepping up vaccine effort - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZVpzR25JZWdJN2lITS1nWEgxTWZGRi1VZTlfRURiVDlZNGo1ZnBtdm0tazNkRDdJemtCXzM2UFZNRDNobTF1cDZueW1rdDFOYmlWcV9SaThTendXRGRiT29ta3F3azlUS2hxNHhTUFZsU0lRbEhaYXRHWkVwYTU0cnJSSWViLVlTS3JtRW4xNklrMUZtdk52VlJDR0UtU2E1TUxIVkFvZk1Td9IBVkFVX3lxTFBPc1VkRHQwX01fUzZoLTM2QWVZeGprc1pHVHN0NW9aUUk1Z2ZDTm5LNDF4T0pEMXVMcjY1UDd2SE1sako3VWR4UENvdUQwTnlPSk85dVB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kala Hunter did not hesitate to get her 2-year-old son, Brady, fully vaccinated in March as the number of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases grew&lt;/a&gt; in her West Texas community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Being in the hotbed of the measles outbreak,” said Hunter, 47, of Lubbock, “it was a no-brainer.

One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A second dose increases protection to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During measles outbreaks, however, the first dose can be given as early as 6 months old. If a child has already received the first dose at 12 months, doctors can give the second dose about a month later, said Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and health authority for the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Public health measures, which include vaccinations, stop the spread of the virus, even in areas with outbreaks of measles,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the time, fewer than 2% of infants get vaccinated early for measles, according to the Truveta data. The company used its access to electronic health record information for tens of thousands of infants in Texas to assess early vaccination uptake in the state. That low percentage isn’t surprising as the shots aren’t generally given early unless there’s an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The data shows that early vaccinations of Texan infants 6 to 11 months old ticked up in February as word of the outbreak spread. The number increased even more in March, and by April, it was exponentially higher than vaccination percentages before the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZVpzR25JZWdJN2lITS1nWEgxTWZGRi1VZTlfRURiVDlZNGo1ZnBtdm0tazNkRDdJemtCXzM2UFZNRDNobTF1cDZueW1rdDFOYmlWcV9SaThTendXRGRiT29ta3F3azlUS2hxNHhTUFZsU0lRbEhaYXRHWkVwYTU0cnJSSWViLVlTS3JtRW4xNklrMUZtdk52VlJDR0UtU2E1TUxIVkFvZk1Td9IBVkFVX3lxTFBPc1VkRHQwX01fUzZoLTM2QWVZeGprc1pHVHN0NW9aUUk1Z2ZDTm5LNDF4T0pEMXVMcjY1UDd2SE1sako3VWR4UENvdUQwTnlPSk85dVB3</guid></item><item><title>疾病正在蔓延。疾病预防控制中心没有像几个月前那样向公众发出警告- NPR | Diseases are spreading.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To accomplish its mission of increasing the health security of the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; that it "conducts critical science and provides health information" to protect the nation. But since President Trump's administration assumed power in January, many of the platforms the CDC used to communicate with the public have gone silent, an NPR analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of the CDC's newsletters have stopped being distributed, workers at the CDC say. Health alerts about disease outbreaks, previously sent to health professionals subscribed to the CDC's Health Alert Network, haven't been dispatched &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;since March&lt;/a&gt;. The agency's main social media channels have come under new ownership of the Department of Health and Human Services, emails reviewed by NPR show, and most have gone more than a month without posting their own new content.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Public health functions best when its experts are allowed to communicate the work that they do in real time, and that's not happening," said Kevin Griffis, who served as the director of communications at the CDC until March. "That could put people's lives at risk."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health emergencies have not paused since January. Cases of measles, salmonella, listeria and hepatitis A and C have spread throughout the country. More than 100 million Americans continue to suffer from chronic diseases like diabetes and breast cancer. The decline in the agency's communication could put people at risk, said four current and former CDC workers, three of whom NPR is allowing to remain anonymous because they are still employed by the CDC and believe they may be punished for speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-67861" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"We are functionally unable to operate communications," said one of the CDC workers. "We feel like our hands are tied behind our backs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before Trump was inaugurated, the CDC managed most of its communication. HHS, the agency that oversees the CDC and more than 20 divisions and agencies, rarely reviewed the content in CDC social media posts or newsletters, CDC workers said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That allowed the CDC to communicate quickly and often.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The whole goal is to say, this is what we know. And here are the best recommendations from experts in the field," said Dr. Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. "And this is the best advice about the way the general population should handle things in order to protect their health."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's communication staff dispersed health messages weekly, monthly and quarterly through a network of more than 150 &lt;a href="https://tools.cdc.gov/campaignproxyservice/subscriptions.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;newsletters&lt;/a&gt; about topics like arthritis, diabetes and food safety. The CDC distributed those newsletters to tens of thousands of subscribers, CDC employees said, including clinicians and laboratories that relied on the information to care for patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Facts from those dispatches were often shared on social media. Information from the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency's publication of public health information and recommendations, was regularly posted across the CDC's main social platforms, like on Facebook and X, formerly Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists and other communication professionals at the CDC could also suggest other health facts to be posted on the agency's main platforms. Those sorts of posts included information on X about topics like how COVID-19 was &lt;a href="https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1253089647317725186" target="_blank"&gt;spreading in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, posts on Facebook about &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/cdc/posts/pfbid02bwr2gcCRGCKhWtbrvZBeohvWWCWXWpexyVzdkT6GHwXUaxTyswh9KGV2m4RBAFsvl" target="_blank"&gt;how to prevent bacterial infections &lt;/a&gt;and posts across platforms about how to get screened for chronic illnesses, like cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The messages quickly reached a wide audience. More than 12 million people subscribe to the CDC's main Facebook, Instagram, X and LinkedIn accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Social media is one of the main ways the CDC communicates plain language, life-saving messages to America," said one CDC employee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But now, many of those messages have stopped being sent out. Changes to communication at the CDC began shortly after Trump was inaugurated in January, when HHS instructed the CDC and other health agencies to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/24/g-s1-44613/cdc-nih-hhs-health-data-mmwr" target="_blank"&gt;pause&lt;/a&gt; any sort of collaboration with people outside the agency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So at that point we stopped pretty much all communications," said a CDC employee who works at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pause affected some of the CDC's most essential publications. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency's regularly published write-up of important new public health research and disease outbreak information, was not released for two weeks after Trump was inaugurated. No report was published on Jan. 23, the first Friday after the inauguration, or on Jan. 30, the second Friday.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The unprecedented break in publication of the weekly reports concerned some subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It stopped publishing at the height of the bird flu outbreak and at the beginning of the measles outbreak," said Guest, the epidemiology professor at Emory, who said she's been reading the report every week since she was a graduate student. "And so it's really a time when we want to get that very consistent and very important and scientifically sound information, and it was all shut down."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_additional_resources.html#cc-widget-8f0c" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; resumed on Friday Feb. 6, around the time workers at the CDC were told they could resume some meetings with external partners, CDC employees said. But the way the facts inside have been shared with the public has not returned to how it was. Communications have not been handled in-house by CDC scientists and communicators like before. All posts that CDC workers want to make to their agency's social media accounts have to be reviewed by HHS, employees at the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we're being told is that, no, your channels aren't going to go back." said a CDC employee.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;On April 24, some employees were sent an email from a supervisor that confirmed that HHS now owned the CDC's main social media platforms, including its X, Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were also notified that HHS is not accepting content for those channels at this time," the email added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response to a request for comment regarding the changes to communication practices at the CDC, the director of  communications at HHS, Andrew Nixon, cast doubt on what the workers said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's unfortunate to see career officials spreading false rumors," Nixon replied. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since HHS approval was instituted as a requirement for posting, almost no newsletters have been sent to the tens of thousands of people who subscribe to them, CDC workers said. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt; sent out by the CDC's Health Alert Network was regarding the risk of dengue infection on March 18, even though outbreaks of salmonella and listeria were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; in May by the CDC on its website.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When CDC publications have gone out, some have been delayed or missing information. A recent release of CDC data regarding the prevalence of HIV in the U.S. cautioned that it "does not include data on PrEP coverage," referring to medication taken by individuals to prevent HIV infection. "CDC is unable to resume PrEP coverage at this time, due to a reduction in force affecting the Division of HIV Prevention (DHP)."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two CDC employees who work in communications told NPR that fewer than half of the public health posts they've sent to HHS for approval have been cleared for publication on social media. Even posts that include basic information about recent disease outbreaks, like the number of people sickened or hospitalized, have not been posted as requested by employees, NPR confirmed after reviewing posts submitted for approval by an employee. Communications workers say they are also suggesting fewer health posts because they anticipate that their posts will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Everything is getting bottlenecked at the top," said a worker. "It is extraordinarily time-consuming and backlogs us by weeks, if not months."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The consequences could be deadly, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you have an outbreak of something like listeria, if you are a person who is pregnant and you consume food items that might have listeria in it that CDC should be warning you about, you run the risk of the baby that you are carrying dying," said Guest. "And so that information needs to get out there."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Propaganda" instead of public health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On April 1, thousands of federal health workers were laid off as part of the government's "reduction in force." Communication professionals at the CDC were not spared. Almost everyone at the CDC whose primary job was to communicate with the press was laid off, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/03/g-s1-57888/hhs-fda-rfk-foia-public-records" target="_blank"&gt;almost everyone&lt;/a&gt; whose job it was to provide records to the public. Every member of the CDC's division of digital media was also told their jobs would be eliminated, workers at the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"All the points of contact that we generally rely on to communicate with the American people have either been eliminated or dramatically reduced," said Griffis, the former CDC communications director.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Removing all the CDC's web developers, graphic designers and social media staffers simultaneously caused a problem. The CDC was suddenly locked out of its main social media accounts, said three people close to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The passwords to those accounts were kept on a password protected Word doc," said one worker at the CDC. "And that Word doc was inaccessible for anyone left, because all of the people that could have opened that document were fired."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the main accounts haven't posted since the CDC's digital media team was laid off. During March, the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/cdc/" target="_blank"&gt;main Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; posted more than 20 times—sometimes twice a day. The posts included information for pregnant women about how to take care of their developing babies and screenings for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p id="resnx-s1-5387723-102" class="bucketwrap statichtml"&gt;
            
   &lt;/p&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;The only main CDC account that has posted some content since April 1 is the CDC's account on X, a platform owned by Elon Musk. He oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, the organization that spearheaded efforts to lay off tens of thousands of workers across federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On April 7, workers at the CDC said they were surprised to see the CDC's main X account post a tweet for the first time in a week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p id="resnx-s1-5387723-103" class="bucketwrap statichtml"&gt;
             
   &lt;/p&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Secretary Kennedy's directive is for CDC to lead the nation in health readiness and response," the post stated, sharing a message from Kennedy's own X account about his visit to Gaines County, Texas. "His visit to Texas Sunday, to support the state's efforts to control the measles outbreak, resulted in discussions with Texas state health officials to deploy another CDC response team to the area to further assist with the state's efforts to protect its citizens against measles and its complications."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-67863" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;No one they knew had drafted the message, the CDC employees said. Compared to the science and health information that had traditionally been posted to the accounts, three of the current workers at the CDC that NPR spoke with said they considered the post about Kennedy to be akin to "propaganda."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Griffis, the former communications director, said there's nothing wrong with retweeting a cabinet secretary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What's undermines the credibility of CDC communications moving forward is the near cessation of pro-vaccination and apolitical public health messages in favor of messages that amplify the secretary," he said. "That makes it a political channel."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Since posting about Kennedy's visit to Texas in early April, the CDC's main X account has re-posted two more tweets from Kennedy's account and re-posted one tweet from the HHS X account, which contradicted a CBS News story. On May 14, the account posted about a recent decline in overdose deaths. By comparison, during the month of April last year, in 2024, the CDC's main X account posted more than 90 times, offering advice and information about topics like alcohol use, a salmonella outbreak, COVID-19 vaccines and wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The director of communications at HHS confirmed that the CDC is not locked out of its X account.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The CDC has access to their X account - it's that simple," Nixon said. "CDC is an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and supports Secretary Kennedy's vision to protect public health and Make America Healthy Again."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nixon did not respond to a request for comment regarding whether the CDC was still locked out of its other main social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to share information regarding public health or other topics, you can send an email to the reporter of this article at eisnerchiara@proton.me.

Anna and her husband, Jordan, both photographers, began documenting Anna’s treatment and the way cancer affected their entire family. But they didn’t look closely at the images until years later, when they began collecting photographers for a book, “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rathkopf.com/personal-projects/her2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HER2: The Diagnosed, the Caregiver, and Their Son&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.” Below, Anna and Jordan each describe how photography allowed them to process their experience. You can also listen to them discuss the project on the “&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/21/photographing-cancer-her2-diagnosed-caregiver-their-son-book-anna-jordan-rathkopf/"&gt;First Opinion Podcast&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anna-rathkopf"&gt;Anna Rathkopf &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At my five-year oncology visit, my doctor told me I was being transferred to survivorship care and, hopefully, I’d never need to see her again. Instead of relief, I had an intense feeling of fear. I realized I was afraid to enter “survivorship.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the months that followed, I felt the urgent need to process what I had gone through, something tangible to help me express and understand the emotions I had buried. I turned to the photography project that had documented our journey and decided to make a book. We titled it “HER2,” named ironically after the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/understanding-a-breast-cancer-diagnosis/breast-cancer-her2-status.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; that characterizes my cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I thought I was ready to face what I had survived, but I didn’t expect the process to profoundly change the way I saw those around me, especially Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While I was eager to make the book, Jordan was not. He didn’t want to revisit some of the most painful moments of our lives, and at first, I couldn’t understand why. As we worked on it together, I began to realize how much I had overlooked his struggles, and how painful it was for him to relive what he had privately endured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From the moment I heard the words, “You have cancer,” my world turned inward. My focus became survival, on my body, my fear, and shielding our son, Jesse, then 2 1/2, as best I could.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jordan, on the other hand, seemed rock solid: always driving me to treatments, holding my hand, reassuring me I’d be OK, researching side effects, taking notes, and asking the doctors questions, all while working and caring for Jesse on the days I couldn’t. He never seemed to falter, and I relied on his strength without any doubt that he would be there for me.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I didn’t see his fear, his sadness, or how deeply he was struggling. I didn’t fully understand how triggering it was for Jordan — how my diagnosis reopened the wounds of his mother’s cancer when he was just a child. She survived, but the experience marked him for life. And if I’m being honest, I didn’t think about any of that at the time. I was focused on surviving. Meanwhile, he carried all of it quietly, never letting me see just how heavy it really was.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1320947" srcset="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-328x219.jpg 328w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-1600x1068.jpg 1600w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-056-DSC_1779-863x576.jpg 863w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 625px) and (max-width: 767px) 719px, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 899px) 835px, (min-width: 900px) and (max-width: 1023px) 635px, (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1199px) 803px, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1439px) 994px, (min-width: 1440px) 982px, 576px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Anna carries Jesse on her back during a hike. She was near the end of her active treatments and uncertain about what would happen next.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jordan Rathkopf&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His photos told a story I hadn’t seen. They showed how he saw me: strong, beautiful, and worthy, even at my lowest. While I felt broken and disconnected from my body, his images held me with love and care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But one thing was glaringly obvious: Jordan was missing. His photos were all of me, or of me with Jesse, or me with other friends and family. It was as though he had erased himself, as if his role in the story didn’t matter. I had taken self-portraits throughout, raw and unfiltered, showing my pain and vulnerability. Jordan had taken none of himself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His absence in the photos revealed how deeply his world had revolved around mine. The balance we’d once shared had shifted entirely toward me and Jesse, leaving him feeling invisible. It struck me how common this is for caregivers, who often feel their experiences are secondary, as though they exist only to support others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One photo in particular really revealed to me the different ways we were experiencing my illness. It was a photo taken by me in my doctor’s office. I was joking around in the foreground, trying to distract myself. In the background, a mirror reflected Jordan’s head slumped, shoulders hunched, the weight of the hospital walls pressing down on him. That image shattered me. I hadn’t realized how much he was carrying: every appointment, every drive, every moment caring for Jesse. His love for me was tied to his fear of losing me, and it had consumed him in ways I had never understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another photo haunts me: Jordan’s eyes in a car’s rearview mirror. At the time, I was grateful he was driving, sparing me from the chaos of New York City traffic and public transportation.  But when we worked on the book, he told me that image made him sad. It reminded him of the times he went to the car to cry, not wanting me to see how scared he was. Hearing that broke my heart. We had been so focused on me that we hadn’t processed his pain.&lt;/p&gt;

What she did not know is that the car is where Jordan would go to cry when he felt overwhelmed by emotions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Anna Rathkopf&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the photos from these past eight years — diagnosis, treatment, and “survivorship” — I now see Jordan’s love in every frame. But I also see the sacrifices he made, the pain he quietly carried and the way it has continued to shape his life.  His images helped me understand how terrifying it must have been for him to watch me during treatment, to see my body change, and to shoulder the weight of our family’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through Jordan’s lens, I began to see myself differently. Even when I felt weak and angry at my body, he saw strength. His love, and the love of my family, carried me through moments when I felt I couldn’t carry myself. At the same time, his photos opened my eyes to the impact my illness had on everyone around me and how deeply they were all affected in ways I hadn’t fully appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making “HER2” hasn’t been easy. In fact, it was much harder than I anticipated. It forced us to revisit moments we both wished we could leave behind. But in doing so, it gave us something we didn’t expect: understanding. It helped us see each other’s experiences not just as a patient and a caregiver, but as partners in a shared, messy, and deeply human story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We created “HER2” because we hadn’t seen a story like ours: a young family navigating cancer together that did not lean into melodrama and did not promote fake positivity. It just showed life as it is, with its ups and its downs. It’s the book and project we wish we’d had when I was diagnosed. Through this project, we’ve finally started to understand each other’s pain and resilience, and it’s helped us move forward together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jordan-rathkopf"&gt;Jordan Rathkopf&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While searching for client images, I came across an unfamiliar hard drive on our desk. Hoping it contained what I needed, I plugged it in and opened a folder labeled “Photos 2016-2019&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;” Inside, I found hundreds of images Anna had taken of herself over the years, self-portraits in environments I didn’t recognize and some literally in our living room and shared spaces. Some were in hospital rooms, others on the beach or dimly lit spaces, capturing her reflection in cracked mirrors or her body sprawled exhausted, motionless. Among these were photos of flowers and landscapes, blurry shots of our son, and many of me in moments in which I did not even realize I was being captured.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But it was the self-portraits, raw, vulnerable, and intimate that changed so much of how I now have come to understand her experience. They revealed a side of Anna I hadn’t seen as if I were stepping into a hidden part of her world. It was like looking through a diary I wasn’t meant to read, but I could not look away. These were Anna’s photos, taken during the years following her breast cancer diagnosis. Viewing them for the first time, I realized how much she had hidden from me. And over time, talking together about why she took these photos helped me understand her perspective as the diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-1024x684.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1320990" srcset="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-328x219.jpg 328w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-500x334.jpg 500w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-1600x1068.jpg 1600w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-640x427.jpg 640w, https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HER2-044-DSC_6029-863x576.jpg 863w" sizes="auto, (min-width: 625px) and (max-width: 767px) 719px, (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 899px) 835px, (min-width: 900px) and (max-width: 1023px) 635px, (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1199px) 803px, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1439px) 994px, (min-width: 1440px) 982px, 576px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;A portrait of Anna on a day she felt particularly low. Jordan saw strength and resilience and Anna felt at her weakest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jordan Rathkopf&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During those years, I focused on documenting moments of love and resilience in Anna. But her photos told a different story, a story I hadn’t seen or perhaps hadn’t wanted to see. Her self-portraits revealed vulnerability and grief: fear in her eyes, her body limp with exhaustion, and moments of fragile stillness in unfamiliar settings. Her images exposed her struggle with profound loss, feeling betrayed by her body, and the fear of leaving Jesse and me behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also made me realize how much pressure she was carrying. To be a good mom, a supportive partner, to stay strong, beautiful, composed — even as her body was being torn apart. I remember showing her a photo I took during the thick of treatment. She was emaciated from chemo and radiation. Her reaction startled me: “Wow, look how good I looked. I was so thin.” That moment revealed to me how much she had internalized expectations of her appearance as a woman. Seeing her photos next to mine, I started to realize just how much I hadn’t fully seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid the darkness, Anna’s photos revealed moments of light, our son resting with melting ice cream in his hand, roses leaning into the sunlight, and a tender self-portrait of her kissing her mother’s forehead. Through her lens, I saw the love she felt for her family and the beauty she found in everyday moments. These were her anchors, the reasons she held on. When I showed her the folder and asked why she hadn’t shared the photos, she seemed surprised. She barely remembered taking many of them, lost in the fog of chemo brain, radiation exhaustion, and depression. As we talked, she opened up about feeling disconnected from her body, grieving her lost fertility, and the guilt she was feeling over what she thought she put us through. She also admitted to feeling deep and lingering anger at cancer, at her body, and at herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the years, Anna’s photography has continued to evolve. Her newer images reflect a delicate balance of vulnerability and strength. They reveal a woman still grappling with the scars of illness but also reclaiming parts of herself. Through her lens, I’ve seen her find joy in our son’s laughter, solace in nature, and quiet moments of love within our family. These photos have grounded her in a life reshaped by illness, a life marked by both pain and beauty. Anna’s images also taught me how much I had misunderstood her experience. While I focused on documenting her strength, her photos revealed the fear, anger, and isolation she carried. They showed how often she felt alone, disconnected from her body, and distant from her sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her photos taught me about myself too. I thought I had hidden my pain, believing I needed to stay steady for her. But her images of me slumped in hospital chairs, clinging to our son revealed my vulnerability. She didn’t see it as weakness; she saw it as love. Through Anna’s lens, I’ve come to see her and myself in ways I never had before. Her photos don’t just tell her story; they challenge the one I thought I already understood. They reveal not only the pain she carried but also the beauty she found in small, fleeting moments. And in doing so, they’ve brought us closer to truly seeing each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here on the Tom’s Guide fitness desk, we love nothing more than a walking trend — from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina"&gt;silent walking&lt;/a&gt; to the viral &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/12-3-30-treadmill-workout" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/12-3-30-treadmill-workout"&gt;12-3-30 workout&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve tried them all. The latest trend in walking? The Japanese Interval Walking Training (IWT), which promises to burn more fat and lower your blood pressure. To find out more, I grabbed a comfy pair of sneakers, one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers,&lt;/a&gt; and gave it a go. Read on to find out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-japanese-interval-walking-method-3"&gt;What is the Japanese interval walking method?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interval walking method originated in Japan, and is a form of HIIT training. As its name suggests, you alternate your pace throughout. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set a timer on your watch or phone and walk for three minutes at a low intensity. This should be a 4/10 effort — you’re still moving, but you should easily be able to hold a conversation with someone next to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then walk three minutes at a high intensity. This is a 7/10 walking effort — you should be working hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep switching between paces for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-3"&gt;What are the benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until now, we’ve been told that 10,000 steps a day is the holy grail to aim for when it comes to walking, but is the IWT method better for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s no right or wrong when it comes to adding more steps to your day, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have found IWT has several health benefits. After three months of doing a 30-minute interval walk three times a week, participants had a lower blood pressure and cholesterol, increased leg strength, and more aerobic capacity than those who walked continuously at a moderate pace for the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re also likely to burn more calories walking intervals, as by nature, you’ll increase your heart rate during the faster-paced minutes. If walking for weight loss is your goal, remember you’ll need to be in a calorie deficit, burning more calories than you consume. One easy way to track this is to strap one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-gave-japanese-interval-walking-training-a-go-here-s-what-happened-3"&gt;I gave Japanese Interval Walking Training a go — here’s what happened &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more, I gave this method a go on my daily walks for a week. Here’s how I got on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZBXTUcLUCBbRCP6FESBk6X" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZBXTUcLUCBbRCP6FESBk6X slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-was-instantly-hooked"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was instantly hooked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method immediately took me back to speed sessions on the track, and I loved it. I loved pushing myself during the faster-paced intervals, then slowing down and catching my breath before going again. Unlike other walking workouts, you jump straight into this one, meaning you’re getting your heart rate pumping almost straight away — perfect if you’re short on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walk every morning, and have done so for years, and this was a great way to mix things up. I noticed my heart rate was higher than it would be on my normal morning walk, although I admit I tend to stroll along with a coffee, not power down the street with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the faster intervals, I had to think about my form — keeping my core engaged, my torso up, and my arms swinging in time with my legs. This helped me maintain pace, albeit to the amusement of my fellow dog walkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-had-to-rewind-my-audiobook-several-times"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I had to rewind my audiobook several times &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I confess, I struggle to do two things at once. On the first day of this challenge, I used the timer on my phone and missed chapters of my audiobook as I watched the minutes tick by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I set up the challenge as a custom workout on my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review"&gt;Apple Watch 10&lt;/a&gt;. The watches buzzed every time I needed to change pace, allowing me to leave my phone in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-s-not-one-to-do-with-a-toddler"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not one to do with a toddler &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two mornings a week, when he’s not in nursery, my toddler joins me on my morning walk. Sometimes in the sling, other times in his stroller. The extra resistance of carrying or pushing my baby made this a real workout and left me sweating. New levels of mom strength unlocked, and all before 9 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My verdict &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a way to mix up your daily walk, increase your fat burn, and reap several health benefits, give Interval Walking Training a go. I loved it, and while I won’t be committing to it seven mornings a week (I’ll admit, I missed my chilled, meditative walks too much), I’ll be sure to keep this up a couple of times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a runner, I use my walks as a form of active recovery, but this was a great way to work on my cardiovascular endurance, without the impact of running. Plus, it was done in 30 minutes. If fitting long workouts into your routine feels overwhelming, this can be done with no equipment, on your lunch break, in your local park.

She lives alone and insists she’s “just fine,” but I can see she’s slipping -- physically, mentally and emotionally. She has high blood pressure, diabetes and serious arthritis, but she won’t stay on her medications. She hasn’t been to a primary care doctor in over five years. She flat-out refuses cancer screenings or even basic lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OQE2TOQXWNFG7HLMMPXJBQLLJI"&gt; Lately, I’ve noticed what could be signs of early dementia -- getting lost on familiar roads, forgetting appointments, struggling to follow conversations. I finally got her to see a neurologist last fall, and they recommended a brain scan and further testing. She never followed through. Now she’s barely leaving the house and won’t let me bring in any outside help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EQZOMK2WZJBCPI62TJWYSI23ZY"&gt; I’ve tried small changes to keep her safe -- grab bars in the bathroom, meal deliveries, even offering to go with her to doctor appointments. Every single time, she shuts me down with, “Don’t start” or, “I’m not an invalid.” She’s isolating more and her mobility is getting worse. I’m scared she’s going to fall or end up in the ER with something that could’ve been managed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AE5LLV5IZFBT7OVIHNZ3OFOO54"&gt; How do I respect her independence while also not sitting back and watching her decline? -- Worried and Worn Out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZTAMB7ZJVZGNXBGBMQWMROQF3M"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Dear Worried:&lt;/b&gt; You are carrying a heavy burden, and I commend your patience and devotion. But here’s the hard truth: You can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. No matter how much you care or how hard you try, you cannot force your mother to seek help if she refuses it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZKTO75QF2RHHFDP5WSGIOJFL6U"&gt; What you can do is focus on safety. Make the home as secure and fall-proof as possible. Consider a home health consultation or speak with her primary care physician about ways to support her from a distance. And for your own well-being, talk to a counselor or support group for caregivers. You need support, too. Loving her the best you can is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JZG3V5MOCFHEDDKMUBPGDO5EBY"&gt;Send your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EBYHIOLEVJHGZJVGXHCIVR7HLQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G5SLRHG7Z5G4HDU77M4Q2RHISY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2UEMV3EN5RH3DMTGZPQLTUFKDE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:KZYFEFL5HNG47PTDYUQYICYD7M" data-fusion-component="KZYFEFL5HNG47PTDYUQYICYD7M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:KZYFEFL5HNG47PTDYUQYICYD7M" data-fusion-component="KZYFEFL5HNG47PTDYUQYICYD7M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MLive.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOVE5ranRfLUZDb1Ntb3VydDdpT1N3SUVoUFhhRnNOcGN5X0RvYjQweTZIUmJmbFBsM0plSnRBckMyYXRzQmU0M0hldHQweDV5eEtUdWZJSnRpSmpmcks2TG9vMEtkS09mQk9VWnJZWnlLOHg0OTkyQ2JxMFlZNlp1R3EwSS1LQVdqUlhPZWdGbmhvZGVYSFdnSkJSM1ZxSmvSAbMBQVVfeXFMT2o2XzJpaUtRYl9BNkhTTGRhU01hYkZ4Z2FyX0NMWUJpLXRGSzhIVFIxdzNVT0N3MDR2eWo3dEp5M2hDd0VweV9Kc2NNbTFaRXY1ZFBlbmxCQzVmM0hTNDZLZHlFNWM0TGo3LVRDc3ZGRTZSNl9QLUxQQ3o1d0VuSTlNYzJEVFdabVlfOHZRZHAxZ3RMeFVaQlA2Uk1NNlZaMFZ1VWZJVkQ0NTVfeTJ4V0NQSEE</guid></item><item><title>首个单一患者基因编辑药物拯救婴儿- NewsForKids.net | Baby Saved by First Single-Patient Gene-Editing Medicine - NewsForKids.net</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOOGw0SmNPRm5pOGpxR2F4YVRuZWsxNFVnOW1tYTZFLUhpZEhkb2JWWklKMnlndTAtTF9hWTI2UHRDc3liNG0xNmJYVEhsMEczMnYxNkNRVUh0SFBiWnd1cVg5RTBjUWZ5QVNuTlBmMU5iVFJXUnd2UWxLS25OZS1ta1FxMF84a0xGeXdOUElHTlNHQ19lQnZySFp5R0JTU2FoLU5Z?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philadelphia, Pennsylvania —&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="#article_map-post" title="Show map"&gt;&lt;span class="maplink"&gt;(Map)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;			&lt;input type="hidden" id="is_mature" value="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have created the first &lt;span class="nfkd" title="Genes are small bits of DNA which work to control different parts of how a living thing grows. For example, a person's eye color depends on their genes." rel="tooltip"&gt;gene&lt;/span&gt;-editing medicine made for a single patient. The patient – a young baby who was sick because of a problem with his &lt;span class="nfkd" title="DNA is a collection of information and instructions stored in a tiny chemical form. Every living thing has DNA that causes it to grow in a certain way." rel="tooltip"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; – is now greatly improved, and is expected to go home soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after he was born, doctors knew that KJ Muldoon was struggling. Test showed that KJ’s DNA had a mistake which made it hard for his body to get rid of a dangerous chemical called ammonia. Too much ammonia can damage the brain and other organs. Roughly half of the children born with this problem die while they’re still babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_25827" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25827" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-2c-1200.jpg" alt="Head and chest of a frail-looking sleeping young infant with multiple tubes going into his nose and sensors on his chest." class="size-medium wp-image-25827" srcset="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-2c-1200.webp 1280w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-2c-1200-500x300.webp 500w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-2c-1200-1024x614.webp 1024w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-2c-1200-200x120.webp 200w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-2c-1200-768x461.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-25827" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Soon after he was born, doctors knew that KJ Muldoon was struggling.

&lt;p&gt;When the human body digests proteins, it creates ammonia. In a healthy person, the liver helps get rid of this ammonia. But because of the problem with his &lt;span class="nfkd" title="Genes are small bits of DNA which work to control different parts of how a living thing grows. For example, a person's eye color depends on their genes." rel="tooltip"&gt;genes&lt;/span&gt;, KJ’s liver couldn’t get rid of ammonia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJ was too young and small for a liver &lt;span class="nfkd" title="Transplanting means replacing an organ (like the heart or kidneys) which has serious problems with a healthy one. Surgery to give someone a transplant is called transplantation." rel="tooltip"&gt;transplant&lt;/span&gt;, and waiting for a transplant would have been very dangerous. Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) asked KJ’s parents if they wanted to try a brand new method – a special medicine made just for KJ. His parent said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing DNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;     DNA is a collection of information and instructions stored in a tiny chemical form. DNA tells cells, the building blocks of a body, what to do. Every living thing has DNA that causes it to grow in a certain way.&lt;br&gt;     Small bits of DNA, called “genes”, help control different parts of how a living thing grows. For example, some genes might control eye color. Some genes work by themselves, others work together. Some may help control more than one thing.&lt;br&gt;     In recent years, scientists have made great progress in their ability to “edit” DNA. CRISPR is a tool that allows scientists to cut out or change a piece of DNA. Editing DNA is tricky and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Penn Medicine had been working on the idea of creating medicines to fix the genes of a single patient. Now they had a chance to really  try it. But the pressure was on, since there wasn’t much time to help KJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied KJ’s DNA. The problem was like fixing one misspelled letter in a word that’s three billion letters long. With the help of lots of scientists pitching in and working long hours, soon they had developed a CRISPR tool for editing KJ’s DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_25826" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25826" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200.jpg" alt="A person wearing a lab coat points at a complex image on a computer monitor in a darkened room." class="size-medium wp-image-25826" srcset="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200.webp 1280w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200-500x300.webp 500w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200-1024x614.webp 1024w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200-200x120.webp 200w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200-768x461.webp 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-25826" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scientists at Penn Medicine had been working on creating medicines to fix the genes of a single patient.

&lt;p&gt;Next, they tested the new medicine on mice and monkeys. The results were positive – the new treatment helped the animals and appeared safe. After just six months, the new medicine was approved by the &lt;span class="nfkd" title="The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is the US government agency that oversees the safety of food, drugs, and medical products." rel="tooltip"&gt;FDA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, KJ had been getting medicine and special treatment to help lower his ammonia levels. KJ was six months old when he got the first small dose of the new medicine, which was designed to reach his liver and make one tiny change to his DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_25828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25828" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-3-1200.jpg" alt="Two masked doctors in medical gowns with the baby, KJ, in a striped shirt.

Above, Dr. Kiran Musunru (left) and Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas (right), who led the researchers from CHOP and Penn who created the new medicine for KJ.&lt;br&gt;(Source: &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital" target="_blank"&gt;CHOP&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the first treatment, KJ was able to eat protein without raising his body’s levels of ammonia. The positive results led his doctors to give KJ two more doses. KJ has gained weight and is now much healthier. Soon, the hospital expects him to go home for the first time in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJ isn’t completely cured. He may need to keep taking medicine, and one day he may need a liver transplant. But he is in far better shape now than when he was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_25831" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25831" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-kj-video-thumbnail.jpg" alt="A smiling young baby looks toward the camera.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists and doctors are extremely excited about the results. In just six months, the researchers and the companies they worked with were able to create a special DNA-editing medicine for a single patient. In the past, that work would have taken 10 years or longer. The project isn’t only a success for KJ. It also brings hope to millions of other people who have conditions that might be treated by similar methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did You Know…?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The treatment for KJ was made possible by &lt;span class="nfkd" title="A decade is ten years." rel="tooltip"&gt;decades&lt;/span&gt; of research paid for by the US government. Fyodor Urnov, one of the scientists involved, said, “I don’t think this could have happened in any country other than the US.” Several of the companies involved helped out for free.&lt;/p&gt;
