They’re at elevated risk for breast cancer, but mammograms often miss tumors buried in dense breasts — and insurers often resist paying for additional scans that may help find the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Now a large study comparing various types of scans has found that mammography enhanced with iodine-based dye can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;And so-called contrast-enhanced mammography can find tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography. M.R.I.s are better at detecting more tumors than standard mammograms, the study found, but are considerably more expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The scans were given to women with dense breast tissue who had already undergone mammograms that hadn’t turned up any abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Contrast-enhanced mammography needs to become standard of care for women with dense breasts,” if they are at high risk of developing breast cancer, said Dr. Fiona J. Gilbert, a professor of radiology at the University of Cambridge’s School of Clinical Medicine.

This is the power of “nutrition synergy” — a concept doctors and dietitians agree everyone should know about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“To put it simply, certain food pairings work better as a duet than as a solo,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dietitianjess.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopDyM3U6XLj7slPeMKWXdxifUhtvHtBLe5D_Q8Fz-YnuV6Sb3j-" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jess DeGore, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jess DeGore, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt; “When combined, they boost the body’s ability to absorb and use specific nutrients, helping you get the maximum benefits. This helps support improved immunity, energy, digestion and beyond.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leveraging this concept is a powerful way to be more intentional about healthy meals. “People often ask which nutrient is the most important for their health, but the real key is eating a variety of whole foods,” says &lt;a href="https://www.frugalnutrition.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Caitlin Self, L.D.N., C.N.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Caitlin Self, L.D.N., C.N.S.&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the blog Frugal Nutrition. “The fun part is that there are tons of synergistic dynamic duos to incorporate into your diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead, experts share the best food combinations to add to your meal planning rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spinach and Lemon Juice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A splash of lemon juice on your spinach does more than just add flavor. Vitamin C significantly enhances the absorption of iron, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11124756/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that pairing these nutrients in a meal together is more effective than eating them separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Iron is an important nutrient, especially for healthy blood. Because the iron in plant-based iron foods like spinach is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK448204/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:not as bioavailable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;not as bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; as animal-based iron foods, it needs a little boost from sources of vitamin C,” says &lt;a href="https://www.michellecaravellacoaching.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Michelle Caravella, R.D.N.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Michelle Caravella, R.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.michellecaravellacoaching.com/normalizing-your-nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Normalizing Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Normalizing Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. “Also, cooking your spinach increases the availability of iron.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other smart pairings include citrus fruits, cantaloupe or strawberries (which all have plenty of vitamin C) with iron-rich foods like lentils, quinoa or tofu. Using citrus marinades on meats is another great way to boost iron absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carrots and Olive Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooking carrots, especially with olive oil, can make them even more nutritious, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S146685640700046X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because beta-carotene — an antioxidant found in carrots — is fat-soluble. That means your body absorbs it better when eaten with healthy fats. Your body &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:converts beta-carotene into vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;converts beta-carotene into vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, which is crucial for your vision, immune function, cell growth and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salad Greens and Olive Oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrots aren’t the only veggie that benefit from a drizzle of olive oil. Fats aid your body in absorbing vitamins A, D, E and K — which makes olive oil a nourishing dressing for all kinds of salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the easiest things you can do is add an olive oil-based dressing to your next salad,” says Caravella. “There are often many fat-soluble vitamins found in a diverse salad, and the salad dressing provides the fat to assist the body in better absorbing their nutrients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless for this synergistic duo: You can find vitamin A in tomatoes and red bell peppers, D in mushrooms, E in nuts and seeds and K in leafy greens, broccoli and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs + Berries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know there are heart-health benefits to pairing fiber with cholesterol-rich foods? “Soluble fiber transforms into a gel-like substance in the digestive system, which traps cholesterol and prevents it from entering your bloodstream,” explains Self. “In other words, the body does a better job at digesting cholesterol when fiber is there to help take out the excess. That’s why eggs, which contain cholesterol, and berries, which are rich in fiber, make a wonderful duo.” Other beneficial fiber-rich sides for your eggs include apples, pears, beans, avocado and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eggs and Raw Veggies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also get a nutrition boost from eating your eggs with raw vegetables. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5086793/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that eating 3 whole eggs with a salad increased the absorption of carotenoids — a type of phytonutrient with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects — up to eight-fold more than eating the salad on its own. Keep hard-boiled eggs on hand to embrace this powerhouse combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salmon and Broccoli &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/calcium-and-vitamin-d-important-bone-health#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20promotes%20bone%20health,our%20muscles%20and%20immune%20system." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plays a crucial role;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plays a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; in helping your body absorb calcium. That makes salmon (which contains the vitamin) and broccoli (a good source of calcium) an ideal pairing to help keep your bones strong, says Caravella. Tuna, egg yolks and tofu are other great sources of vitamin D that can be paired with calcium-rich foods like kale, collard greens and fortified dairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turmeric and Black pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is packed with antioxidants that help protect your cells, but its benefits are amplified when paired with black pepper. Pepper enhances turmeric’s bioavailability, which helps your body absorb its health-promoting properties, explains DeGore. So next time you make a golden latte or stir-fry, don’t forget to add a dash of pepper!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raspberries and Dark Chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re craving a sweet treat, consider raspberries and dark chocolate. According to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S088915751500071X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, combining cocoa with raspberries can significantly enhance the antioxidant effects of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice and Beans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans are great source of protein, but they’re a bit limited because they don’t contain all nine amino acids that our bodies need to function. Eating a variety of proteins helps you get the essential amino acids it needs. Likewise, you can make a protein-packed plate by pairing a plant protein and a grain — like beans and rice. “On their own, they’re missing some essential amino acids, but together they deliver all nine that your body needs but cannot produce on their own,” says Carvella. “This duo is especially beneficial for those who primarily eat a plant-based diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole Wheat Bread and Peanut Butter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole wheat bread and peanut butter are another powerful plant-based protein duo. Each one contains the amino acids that the other lacks so when you eat them together you can get all the amino acids you need. Ideally, look for bread that has whole-grain flour or whole-wheat flour listed as the first ingredient. You can also add sliced bananas to your sandwich for added fiber and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 13:21:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE52ZVU1NXdjQlhBTjkxQVg2MXA3cFJnMnBKNmtOVkZWYzJWR285Wktyc05NVmZ2OEtybndneXRFUUJuOFR5RlJ4ZTB4d1Bza3M5MThIR0pvN2RSSU80MEFmck9HNFNQXzBoNXNtdjQzSElra1U1UXc</guid></item><item><title>金毛小狗坚持自己走回家，我们痴迷于他的自信-雅虎 | Golden Retriever Puppy Insists on Walking Himself Home and We’re Obsessed with His Confidence - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNblQtcm51OHlZWUVYMjRuME00dGF1OXc0eXhNMjRFWUFadndyVzdWNUF6SzVpTFNjNktSc0U1RHpTUS1qS3V1T2JyRXdoak1zX1NrcENvcU9QYnViVE03bE85Qkl1QnhBOF9kNW83UWVHbTlvNk8yQkNHUXF1NUk0Q1pBZURiWnVtZFVpcXRB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Puppies are always eager to explore the world, but some, right from the start, take their independence very seriously and want to prove to the world they can do anything they set their mind do. In a dog, when confidence meets cuteness, it's game over for our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In an adorable video, we meet a Golden Retriever puppy who decides he’s more than capable of taking the reins after their evening walk. He’s got the confidence of someone who’s been on this planet for far longer than just a few weeks, and we’re in love. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On May 14, 2025, Reddit user Exact_Rate_6661 posted a video in r/goldenretrievers of their tiny Golden Retriever puppy and it might be one of the cutest clips we’ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the video we meet a small pup who is very much in charge of his life, and his parents. He doesn’t care that he’s been on the planet for a short amount of time because when he wants something, he knows how to get it and doesn’t hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s dark outside and he’s probably getting very sleepy, given how much energy we’re watching him expel in this video. He grabs his blue lead from his parent’s hands and decides to walk himself home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With his tail wagging and his mouth proudly holding his own lead, he trots along like a seasoned pro. It’s equal parts adorable and impressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/golden-retrievers-dead-stare-meeting-sibling-wins-internet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Golden Retriever's Dead Stare Upon Meeting New Puppy Sibling Wins the Internet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Golden Retriever's Dead Stare Upon Meeting New Puppy Sibling Wins the Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the comments, many Reddit users chimed in with some thoughts on this adorable Golden Retriever, and had only the most kind words to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One person wrote, “Many puppies do this. He's very young. I predict this behaviour will change. You won't be able to get him home in a few weeks when he's a bit older and more interested in the outside world and abundant smells. Cheers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another shared, “He thinks he's walking &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Someone else added, “They are all the same haha my 8mo old will still try to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One joked, “Look at me - I am the leash owner now!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other comments included, “Aww, I miss when my girl was that little and did that,” “He’s a strong independent floof that doesn’t need no hooman to lead him,” “C’mon hooman,” “Just a big boi doing big boi things,” and “My guy did this too when he was little. I use a belt leash, so I imagine in his mind this was him walking me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One user offered some advice, writing, “They may grow out of it, and they may not. My dog pulls on his leash at 8 from the point we put in on until we get to the driveway, and then it's not stop sniffs for however long the walk is. It's never too early to start the ‘hey don't chew that behaviors.’ My dog prefers the &lt;em&gt;nononono&lt;/em&gt; in a soft voice approach to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There's no convincing us that after this walk and his overpouring confidence that this Golden Retriever puppy didn't have the restful sleep.

            To prep for a good night’s sleep, start at breakfast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000e3b6mv11i1bey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What you eat throughout the day could affect your quality of sleep at night. Adding foods with the right nutrients could help you get to sleep, stay asleep and wake up more refreshed, according to Dr. Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of the Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000f3b6mf7yvy11z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Better-Sleep-Food-Sleep-Connection/dp/1982198443" target="_blank"&gt;Eat Better, Sleep Better&lt;/a&gt;: 75 Recipes and a 28-Day Meal Plan That Unlock the Food-Sleep Connection,” St-Onge presents research linking certain foods with the production of melatonin — and better rest.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000g3b6mbkwukd8y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep and wake cycles. But the production of melatonin relies on tryptophan, an amino acid that people need to get from nutrients because the body can’t produce them, said St-Onge, who is also a professor of nutritional medicine at Columbia University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000h3b6mii3z7rgo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While some ingredients in particular can help provide tryptophan or encourage melatonin production, just eating a handful of nuts right before bed isn’t going to do the trick, said Dr. Erica Jansen, assistant professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000i3b6muc58bltr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The book is a good representation of the current science around sleep and food, which shows that the best approach to eating for better sleep focuses on what you eat throughout the day rather than prioritizing one food for a quick fix, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000j3b6mo9s8xwtv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s really what I see in my research as well –– that it’s a whole approach to eating,” Jansen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000k3b6m45vaycve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research suggests that overall, having a balanced, whole-food diet is helpful, St-Onge said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000l3b6m4uttpdam@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She recommends focusing on a diet heavy in plants (like fruits and vegetables) but also high in whole grains, fiber and protein sources that are lower in saturated fats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000m3b6mqoxiieyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Such foods include legumes such as chickpeas, lentils, tofu, nuts, seeds and beans, which are all good sources of tryptophan, according to the book.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000n3b6m8txxcn7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When choosing carbohydrates, look for fiber-rich options, and avoid highly processed carbs such as cakes, cookies and crackers, St-Onge wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000o3b6makd9mwnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Need more guidance? Eating a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/eat-but-better"&gt;Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt;, which is higher in fats from fish and olive oil, was associated with a lower risk of insomnia and more time spent sleeping, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30137563/" target="_blank"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; by St-Onge and her coauthors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000p3b6mmef41orm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other micronutrients also help support your body’s response to tryptophan and melatonin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Add zinc to your diet with ingredients like almonds, oysters and wheat bran; magnesium with chia seeds, cashews and yogurt; vitamin B with bananas, chickpeas and tuna; and folate with broccoli, lentils and spinach, according to St-Onge’s book.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Melatonin and other supplements aren’t as helpful
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000r3b6mksr26ed4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It isn’t a matter of cutting everything that isn’t sleep-promoting out of your diet but rather working in more of sleep-promoting foods as you can, Jansen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000s3b6mqo8ki765@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you want to eat something that’s really not sleep-promoting, it’s not a big problem,” she said. “It’s not a very prescriptive diet.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000t3b6mpie8xi73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, it might not be a good idea to eat something sugary, spicy or caffeinated before bed, Jansen said. Focus on adding nutrients that promote sleep instead of restricting foods that don’t.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000u3b6mef3tpdcu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Can’t you just get melatonin or the nutrients that promote it from supplements? Not ideally, St-Onge said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000v3b6mg3j8khus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Supplements don’t always provide the right dosage or optimal form of a nutrient, she said. In many cases, nutrients work best paired together, whereas supplements often deliver the nutrient by itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000w3b6mm05oifmg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Getting nutrients from a balanced diet is generally healthier and safer than supplements,” St-Onge wrote. “Plus, absorbing nutrients from foods is more efficient than extracting them from supplements.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000x3b6m4q51gky5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Though people who are already eating a nutrient-dense diet can do more to optimize their sleep, the ones who will likely benefit most are people who have poor diets, Jansen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000y3b6my8t2b32u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you want to add more whole foods with sleep-promoting nutrients into your day, dietitian Alexandra Babcock recommends starting with one meal, particularly one that needs more inspiration.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw000z3b6minoz6bic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For some people, that’s breakfast. You can add one serving of fruit, vegetables or beans to your morning meal, Babcock said. She loves eating savory oatmeal with a poached egg and black beans.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw00103b6mgor49u3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you want to add more whole foods to your lunch, a salad with chickpeas is a good option, according to Babcock, who owns Nutrition Innovations in Austin, Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw00113b6munsg7nos@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chickpeas don’t have to be boring, Babcock added. “They can have flavor. They can be toasted and roasted in spices.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;Add a serving of veggies at dinner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Small changes geared toward a healthier lifestyle often build on one another: Adjusting one meal could lead to more changes, which could motivate you to get more active — and, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/health/insomnia-exercise-wellness"&gt;exercise is linked&lt;/a&gt; to better sleep.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw00133b6mt9zlj62w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lifestyle changes can help you get better sleep, but that might not be enough for people who have insomnia, Jansen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmazzmqcw00143b6mc6mnn613@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It does have to be kind of like a holistic approach,” she said. “For someone who has really significant sleep disorder, their sleep disorder really should be addressed by a physician at the same time that they’re improving their diets.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

But experts warn a lesser-known issue is on the rise, particularly among boys: muscle dysmorphia, aka &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-bigorexia_l_677d7df8e4b07acf439ce592" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="“bigorexia.”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="677d7df8e4b07acf439ce592" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;“bigorexia.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bigorexia is a psychological condition and type of body dysmorphic disorder which involves a distorted self-image that focuses specifically on muscle size and physical appearance,” &lt;a href="https://www.newporthealthcare.com/who-we-are/healthcare-leadership/#kara-becker" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kara Becker" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.newporthealthcare.com/who-we-are/healthcare-leadership/#kara-becker" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Kara Becker&lt;/a&gt;, a certified eating disorder therapist and national director of eating disorder programs at Newport Healthcare, told HuffPost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With bigorexia, the afflicted person is obsessed with becoming more muscular and preoccupied with the idea that their body isn’t brawny enough ― even if they actually have the physique of a bodybuilder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals may have an inaccurate view of their bodies, often believing they are smaller or less muscular,” said &lt;a href="https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/profile/amy-gooding" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Amy Gooding" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eatingrecoverycenter.com/profile/amy-gooding" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Amy Gooding&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical psychologist at Eating Recovery Center, Baltimore. “This belief and subsequent preoccupation can lead to unhealthy behaviors, including obsessive exercise, and may lead to changing one’s eating to be as lean as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although muscle dysmorphia can affect anyone, it’s more common in males, and research suggests the disorder is on the rise. &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/06/414726/22-young-men-5-young-women-engage-disordered-eating-bulk" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="A 2019 study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/06/414726/22-young-men-5-young-women-engage-disordered-eating-bulk" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;A 2019 study&lt;/a&gt;

found that hospitalizations for eating disorders in male patients had risen dramatically since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there’s more awareness around eating disorders, muscle dysmorphia can be overlooked for several reasons ― one reason being that it can lead to behaviors often encouraged in the weight room,” Gooding said. “Lack of awareness of the disorder may lead to the disorder being missed in someone who is struggling, as this is one of the less well-known disorders. Those who struggle may hesitate to reach out for help due to shame, secrecy or the normalization of the behaviors in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s fueling the rise of bigorexia in kids and young adults?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many potential causes and influences, including biological, psychological and sociocultural factors that can contribute to the development of this disorder,” Becker said. “A family history of mental health conditions, especially disorders related to body image or anxiety, may increase the chance of developing bigorexia. Likewise, people with low self-esteem, perfectionism or obsessive-compulsive tendencies are more vulnerable to developing this disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trauma and bullying are potential risk factors for bigorexia as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bodybuilders and other people who lift weights are at a higher risk than the general population,” Nagata said. “Competitive athletes are more at risk than noncompetitive athletes. Athletes who lift weights to change the appearance of their bodies are at higher risk than those who focused on improving performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts who spoke to HuffPost agreed that one of the biggest factors contributing to the rise of bigorexia is the proliferation of social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only are young people consuming body ideals from the media, but they feel pressure to produce content and display their own bodies on social media,” Nagata said. “Men’s bodies are on display more than ever on social media, especially through influencer accounts. Constant comparisons to these idealized bodies may lead to body dissatisfaction and bigorexia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overemphasis on an idealized physical appearance in media and advertising is particularly harmful for younger boys, who might not fully appreciate that influencers and celebrities actually make their livelihood off images of their bodies. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPOzOanrNyg" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a different reality" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPOzOanrNyg" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;a different reality&lt;/a&gt; that is unattainable (not to mention undesirable) for most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TikTokers and other social media influencers are making millions of dollars by getting likes and followers, which they then invest in professional trainers, full-time chefs, and other experts to curate and maintain their image,” said &lt;a href="https://www.bryant.edu/academics/faculty/trunzo-joseph" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Joseph J.

In short, we are constantly exposed to unrealistic, idealized and glamorized versions of the human body at a rate that we have never experienced before. In the hands of an impressionable young person, this is a very dangerous dynamic and recipe for psychological disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment sections also expose posters and viewers to harsh critiques about people’s bodies, which can fuel more insecurity and low self-esteem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those struggling with muscle dysmorphia, seeing pictures and messaging on social media may cause a person to have harmful thoughts about the need to change their body,” Gooding said. “They may start to train more in the gym and worry about losing body fat to enhance their muscular bodies. Soon this training becomes excessive and obsessive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can parents do? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways parents can help counteract the forces that fuel body image issues and psychological disorders like bigorexia. &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Limit social media consumption as much as possible, but recognize that you cannot eliminate it altogether,” Trunzo advised. “Your child will be exposed to these images, so talk to them about what they are seeing. Listen to what they say, how they interpret what they see, make sure they understand the reality behind what they are viewing and are not ‘buying’ the image.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommended emphasizing values of human worth and dignity that go beyond physical appearance. Focus on qualities like kindness, creativity, humor, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to provide support by creating a safe space for open conversations,” Becker said. “Be a positive role model by demonstrating a healthy attitude toward your own body and self-esteem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to the comments you make about your own bodies in front of your children and the attitudes toward exercise and food you’re displaying. Be mindful of the kinds of messages your kids are getting from their entertainment and social media activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents should challenge unhealthy and unhelpful messaging about ‘perfect bodies’ and social acceptance,” Gooding advised. “Body diversity should be discussed and praised. Conversations surrounding exercise should include messages about proper fueling, refueling, rest and balance in workouts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When images of buff celebrities appear on your child’s radar, provide context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been having conversations with my 9-year-old son like, ‘Let’s read what Hugh Jackman said about what he had to do to transform into Wolverine and look like this,’” said therapist &lt;a href="https://nourishedsoulcenter.com/cherie/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cherie Miller" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264ed9e4b0a8ff0de704d9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nourishedsoulcenter.com/cherie/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Cherie Miller&lt;/a&gt;, who is CEO and clinical director at Nourished Soul Center for Healing. “It’s a chance to say, ‘You know, this isn’t normal, this isn’t realistic, and this is not something that we should try to attain.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She focuses “body respect” ― reminding her children that we care about our bodies and want to take care of them, so we do things like drinking enough water, getting enough sleep and eating a variety of foods. The goal is to avoid extremes and know that bodies are great because of the functions they serve in helping us live our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Talking about body diversity as a good and natural thing is important too,” Miller said. “Life would be boring if we all looked the same. So isn’t it great that we come at all sizes and shapes and colors. Look at all the different plants and animals in the world too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If parents believe their child is being bullied or teased about their appearance, they should take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Early intervention and treatment are vital to stopping the progression of muscle dysmorphia,” Gooding said. “If a parent recognizes behavior that may cause concern for the child, parents should engage in conversation with their child about the thought process surrounding their exercise behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagata shared some typical warning signs for muscle dysmorphia, urging parents to take note if their child develops a preoccupation or obsession with weight, food, exercise or appearance in a manner that “worsens their quality of life and impairs their social, school or daily functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, some boys spend all of their waking hours exercising and feel guilty if they are not at the gym,” he said. “They may no longer eat with their families or friends because of rigid concerns about their nutrition and diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you suspect your child is starting to struggle with bigorexia, know that they are not alone and there are resources that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Boys with muscle dysmorphia or eating disorders should seek professional help,” Nagata said. “They can discuss these issues with a primary care pediatrician.

I found myself having difficulty falling asleep and, even when I did, waking up in the middle of the night. As a freelancer who makes my own schedule, I attempted to fill in the gaps with occasional naps, but it was still a vicious cycle of feeling constantly exhausted during the day, only to not be able to doze off when my head hit the pillow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, I didn't think my issues were serious enough to warrant a doctor's visit (and didn't want to deal with the hassle of potentially having to find and see a specialist), so I turned to what I thought was the next best option: Unisom, an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g39284222/best-sleep-aids/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g39284222/best-sleep-aids/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="over-the-counter sleep aid" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="1.1.0"&gt;over-the-counter sleep aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s just one problem about taking this sleep shortcut: meds like Unisom, a.k.a. doxylamine succinate—which are found in both OTC sleep aids &lt;em data-node-id="1.3"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; allergy meds—are actually pretty bad for your brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Though most sleep aids and certain &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g36446792/best-otc-allergy-medicine/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g36446792/best-otc-allergy-medicine/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="allergy med" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.1.0"&gt;allergy med&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; labels indicate that they're not intended for long-term use, they often don’t say why. A close friend who is also a physician clued me into why these OTC options aren't ideal: Frequent use of antihistamines that fall into the category of first-generation antihistamines has been tied to an increased risk of dementia. In fact, a study published this year in the &lt;a href="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="World Allergy Organization Journal" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="2.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.3.0.0"&gt;World Allergy Organization Journal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests people should avoid taking Benadryl, which is a first-gen antihistamine, altogether. (And, BTW, these meds were put on the market all the way back in 1946, before they were required to undergo safety testing, according to research by the the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-allergy-and-clinical-immunology-in-practice" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-allergy-and-clinical-immunology-in-practice" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology" data-node-id="2.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="2.5.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.5.0.0"&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This is a serious concern among medical experts, says Pamela Tambini, MD, an internal medicine physician and medical director at Engage Wellness. "People sometimes assume these medications must be harmless because they are sold over the counter, but if you use them too often or for too long, they can mess with your thinking, make you groggy during the day, and possibly lead to long-term problems," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So while they might be safe to take every once in a while, here's why doctors strongly recommend considering other options for sleep or allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://engagewellnessnow.com/contributor/dr-pamela-tambini/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://engagewellnessnow.com/contributor/dr-pamela-tambini/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pamela Tambini" data-node-id="6.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.2.0"&gt;Pamela Tambini&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a Palm Beach Gardens, FL-based double board-certified physician in internal and addiction medicine and medical director at Engage Wellness in Acton, MA, Seetha Bhagavatula, MD, a Maryland-based board-certified geriatrician and internal medicine physician at &lt;a href="https://remo.health/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://remo.health/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Remo Health" data-node-id="6.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.4.0"&gt;Remo Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="heres-why-first-generation-antihistamines-are-bad-for-your-brain-health" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;Here’s why first generation antihistamines are bad for your brain health.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;First, a quick refresher on what antihistamines are exactly. Antihistamines are medications that work primarily to block histamine, a chemical released by the immune system during allergic reactions or infections, says Seetha Bhagavatula, MD, a board-certified geriatrician and internal medicine physician at Remo Health. Histamine is what causes the uncomfortable allergy symptoms you might experience like a runny nose, itchy eyes, or irritated skin. Luckily, “by preventing histamine from binding to its receptors, antihistamines effectively reduce these allergy-related symptoms throughout the body," says Dr. Bhagavatula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;They’re an easily available solve for people with mild seasonal allergies, but these meds affect more than just your runny nose. They also make you sleepy (which is why they pop up in OTC sleep medications) and affect many other systems in your body, Dr. Tambini says. "Since histamine also helps keep you awake, blocking it makes you feel sleepy, which is why they’re often used in sleep aids—they sort of sedate you as a side effect," Dr. Tambini says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;However, patients with allergic rhinitis (commonly known as "hay fever") taking first-generation antihistamines face an increased risk of developing dementia, according to a 2024 study in the &lt;a href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00541-5/abstract" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00541-5/abstract" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="10.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="10.1.0.0"&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study also found some risk with second-generation antihistamines, but the risk was far lower. "There might still be a slight risk for cognitive effects," says dr. Tambini. "However, that risk is very low for most healthy adults taking them occasionally or even seasonally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;That’s because there’s another major system certain antihistamines affect: Your brain. Older antihistamines, known as first-generation antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (ZzzQuil) and doxylamine (Unisom) cross into the brain and block histamine receptors there, whereas second-generation antihistamines were designed to avoid that, says Dr. Tambini. They specifically target acetylcholine—which happens to be a key brain chemical involved in memory, focus, and learning. This makes an impact on long-term brain health, according to the research. Frequent sleep medication use was associated with an increased risk of dementia in older adults, highlighting that risk may vary by race as well, according to a 2023 study in the &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-221006" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-221006" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Alzheimer's Disease" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="12.1.0.0"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"If you are constantly dampening that system with these medications, your brain does not function as well," Dr. Tambini says.

Whether it’s stress, poor sleep hygiene, side effects of another medication, or insomnia, you’re going to want to get to the bottom of your sleep issues to find the best treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;"Sleep is complex, and while reaching for a quick fix might be tempting, those fixes sometimes cause more problems than they solve," Dr. Tambini says. "There are safer, more effective options out there—and talking to your doctor is a great first step in figuring out what’s really going on and how to get your sleep back on track."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But, it &lt;em data-node-id="24.1"&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; okay to occasionally use an OTC sleep aid such as Unisom or ZzzQuil in a pinch, she says. "Taking something for a night or two can be fine if you’re dealing with a temporary sleep issue—like jet lag or stress before a big event," Dr. Tambini says. "[But once you] build up a tolerance, which can happen in just one to two weeks of regular use, they stop working as well, and your body starts relying on them, you’re not actually addressing the root cause of why you can’t sleep in the first place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Long-term, both Dr. Tambini and Dr. Bhagavatula advise looking into solutions that *don’t* affect your brain health, which include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="for-sleep" data-node-id="27" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;For Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Alternatives to something like ZzzQuil include supplements like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64019685/melatonin-dna-repair-study/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64019685/melatonin-dna-repair-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="melatonin" data-node-id="28.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="28.1.0"&gt;melatonin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and valerian root, which some people find helpful, according to Dr. Tambini (but the science isn’t completely settled on yet, per a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7585905/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7585905/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine" data-node-id="28.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="28.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="28.3.0.0"&gt;Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you’re really struggling to catch some Zzzs, though, both docs recommend cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, which is the most effective treatment, per a 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362185028_Cognitive_Behavioral_Therapy_for_Insomnia_CBT-I_A_Primer" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362185028_Cognitive_Behavioral_Therapy_for_Insomnia_CBT-I_A_Primer" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clinical Psychology and Special Education" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="29.1.0.0"&gt;Clinical Psychology and Special Education&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The rest are due to complications from localized tumors or blood cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When you look at the literature, you quickly realize that 70 percent of cancer patients do not succumb to the primary tumor, but the metastatic spread,’ Rodriguez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After years of research in chemical biology that can be leveraged to fight cancer , Dr Raphael Rodriguez and his team have developed a molecule that could save millions from deaths caused by the cancer spreading to other parts of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I realized the gap. The treatments we have are not sufficient — they are not designed to target metastasis, and they are not designed to target the capacity of a cell to migrate.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer cells hoard iron in special compartments called lysosomes, which makes them more aggressive — but also gives them a hidden weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That same iron can trigger a process called ferroptosis, which destroys the cancer cell from the inside out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez said: ‘We conceptualize the fact that cancer cells can exploit iron chemistry to adapt, to change identity, to be plastic, to become invasive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But at the same time, he said, iron is chemically active (redox-active), meaning it easily reacts with molecules in cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The paper that we just published exploits that finding, basically: could we develop a compound that would accumulate inside of the cell where iron is loaded, and can we manipulate the chemistry of iron?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez, a French biochemist, helped develop Fentomycin-1, a molecule that supercharges ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early lab tests, metastatic cancer cells were wiped out in less than 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cancer cells aggressively stockpile iron in lysosomes to fuel their spread—but this creates a fatal flaw. The same iron can trigger ferroptosis, a self-destruct mechanism that corrodes tumors from within&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And this was spectacular,’ Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point in time, cancer patients are dying — specifically in this population [with these cancers]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And it was very gratifying for us to see that we are capable of designing a compound that does what we wanted to do.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team tested Fento-1 in aggressive forms of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and sarcomas, a group of rare malignant tumors that form in bones or soft tissues — all known for drug resistance, high iron levels, and grim survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mice injected with breast cancer cells, the drug slowed tumor growth and activated the immune system, potentially offering a one-two punch with existing treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also worked well in combination with chemotherapy, especially in pancreatic cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rodriguez’s lab even tested tumor samples taken directly from patients after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The compound reduced the number of cells with CD44, a protein that helps cancer resist drugs and spread to new organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rodriguez's team tested Fento-1 in aggressive forms of pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and sarcomas, a group of rare malignant tumors that form in bones or soft tissues — all known for drug resistance, high iron levels, and grim survival rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because cancer cells have higher iron levels than surrounding healthy tissue, Fento-1 can target tumors with precision, leaving normal cells relatively unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical trials will be needed to determine if these molecules could be leveraged as new cancer treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before then, Rodriguez said, his team will have to raise funds for the next stage of research, which will establish basic knowledge about how the compound might interact with living human cells in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Rodriguez is clear — getting there will take funding, testing, and more time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There are a few other [data sets] that are not published, and what we now need to do is [figure out] can we scale up the compound, is it stable, is it bioavailable, can we take it by IV, how does it get decomposed inside the body, what is the clearance of it?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point in time,’ he added, ‘we are happy with the compound we made.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team's findings were published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="class" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08974-4"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Metastatic cancer cells are adept at resisting chemotherapy by developing ways to prevent the medicine from entering the cell, and radiation treatments, by learning how to repair any damage done to their DNA to help them survive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cancer cells spread beyond their original site in the body, or metastasize, it becomes markedly more difficult to treat and reach remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metastatic cancer cells can adapt to new, hostile environments, such as unfamiliar organs and tissues, adjusting their metabolism and outsmarting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also adept at resisting chemotherapy by developing ways to prevent the medicine from entering the cell, and radiation treatments, by learning how to repair any damage done to their DNA to help them survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimating the exact number of Americans living with metastatic cancer at any single time is challenging due to limited real-time tracking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Cancer Institute estimated in 2018 that there were &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/ocs?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template#:~:text=Researchers%20at%20the%20National%20Cancer,693%2C452%20by%20the%20year%202025."&gt;more than 623,000&lt;/a&gt; people in the US living with the six most common metastatic cancers - bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, prostate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That rate was expected to increase to nearly 700,000 in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 04:48:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPdWw5VzdjRHRrdW1TV3BPa1VXWXY2c3BsYUlQZ0JnbnlYRlNJaFQwdGd5TEdFR2V5Vk9Kd1pMVGdkSUVFYkNQQVBDdF9TWlJBZ2pQNUY4N3o1VVRNakRSb2dickhheldlTGwtVGN0eS1xRndEdkgtWkRucTZDNC1EWEdNWnQyNklPS1V3OHlwbUtsdGt1WVRBRXlJQ05KRzBVY3N5ZtIBqgFBVV95cUxQRDFtdDV5NUlaaTFWM1JMRFJYdlkzdC0wdnJ1VVpsaHNvMElKdWZTMEMwc1J1VnRpbDE3S0xMUEFobHhjTnlPQTlmNGdaRzF5bWU4NlVlYl96RGgtUktxaF9xME5QTGdGaS1SOERITXM0RVU3WjFzdTBqM21iQjlyWlpUbjdHN251TUZBM3dHU01uM1N5OHd6cmNXSWFyNVA5M0dHd2FhZmFjUQ</guid></item><item><title>睡眠不好3晚后，您的心脏开始受苦- ScienceAlert | Your Heart Begins to Suffer After Just 3 Nights of Bad Sleep - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOZVZLTlVwN0ZDU0JucEVOS1FQc08xRjRfNzR2WUd1MTk2alNmZ2xjZkR6NDNLaEQtWTRzZHNIV3Joa2g5bklLc3poWXVBVVhzNDBuS0JTTXE5MC1nNFFwN2o3MHBwSFhBc3ZkQzNQSWpVSFM4S3JkRkJSRXZxbnAyeklfckpBd09KdVEyRjh0SEM3bzg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We've long known that a lack of sleep is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32442289/"&gt;bad for the heart&lt;/a&gt; – but scientists are now starting to understand exactly how it causes harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://biomarkerres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40364-025-00776-0"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from Uppsala University in Sweden, researchers found that just three nights of restricted sleep – around four hours a night – triggered changes in the blood linked to a higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at inflammatory proteins in the blood. These are molecules the body produces when it is under stress or fighting off illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these proteins stay high for a long time, they can damage blood vessels and raise the risk of problems like heart failure, coronary heart disease and atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 16 healthy young men who spent several days in a lab, where everything from their meals to their activity levels and light exposure was carefully controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants followed two routines: three nights of normal sleep (8.5 hours) and three night of sleep restriction (4.25 hours). After each sleep phase, the men completed a short, high-intensity cycling workout, and their blood was tested before and after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured almost 90 different proteins in the blood samples. They found that sleep deprivation caused a clear rise in inflammatory markers linked to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while exercise usually boosts healthy proteins such as interleukin-6 and BDNF (which support brain and heart health), these responses were weaker after poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162472" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-642x428.jpg" alt="Your Heart Begins to Suffer After Just Three Nights of Bad Sleep" class="size-medium wp-image-162472" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/sleepless-2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162472" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exercise usually boosts healthy proteins that support brain and heart health, but these responses were weaker after poor sleep. (Pekic/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Even young adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, the changes happened even in young, healthy adults, and after only a few nights of bad sleep. That's worrying given how common it is for adults to &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/0400/p397.html"&gt;experience poor sleep from time to time&lt;/a&gt; – and around &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589670"&gt;one in four people&lt;/a&gt; work shifts that disrupt sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that the time of day blood was taken mattered: protein levels varied between morning and evening, and even more so when sleep was restricted. This suggests that sleep affects not only what's in your blood, but when those changes are most visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although modern life often encourages us to trade sleep for productivity, socialising or screen time, studies like this remind us that the body keeps score – quietly, chemically and without compromise.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256534/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

'And they know it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a shocking twist, Cofer claimed to have known at least 40 people who have taken their own lives after Lasik - unable to go on living with the constant pain and vision problems developed after the procedure, The Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a way to spread awareness, Cofer runs the&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/LasikComplicationsFaceBookGroup"&gt; Lasik Complications Support Group&lt;/a&gt; on Facebook - just one of many organizations on social media created in response to the unspoken dangers of Lasik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I really didn't want to stick around at times, but I decided I would to get the word out about how dangerous this surgery can be,' she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you understand Lasik and what it does to the eyes and cornea, you realize you can't do it on a healthy eye and not expect complications,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Lasik and similar surgeries, a small flap is cut into the cornea, which is then raised slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This reshaping changes the way that light is refracted to make up for nearsightedness or farsightedness that occur when light doesn't hit the proper spot on the retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to her family, Starr (pictured) reached out to various eye doctors and even sought help with a therapist, but her emotional state continued deteriorating in the two months following the surgery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Fitzpatrick's heartbreaking suicide note, he wrote: 'Just the pain of burning eyes inside my head and throughout myself… Since 1996 Pain, pain and more pain, please forgive me for not being strong enough to cope.

'I couldn't work. I couldn't drive. I felt like I was still a young man and I lost my life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he heard about Dr. Boshnick's work, whose optometric practice offers vision and comfort restoration due to a variety of eye conditions and surgeries - including Lasik.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rutner was eventually fitted with a scleral lens, a specialized contact that covers and protects corneas damaged by Lasik.

Longevity is not just about living longer, it’s about feeling good as you age — strong in body &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;mind. If anyone knows about healthy aging, it’s cardiologist Eric Topol, who studied “super agers” for decades. This week, we’re sharing a few things he learned while taking a look at these ultrahealthy older folks. First up? The secret to their success is not all about genetics. With a few lifestyle tweaks, you can dramatically increase your chances of becoming a super ager yourself. But before that …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;This week’s must-reads:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="LLQ3JXVEVJE73JUNCWKVZJZKUY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rough night ahead?

But long covid is an umbrella term, and treating it as one disease is, in a way, equivalent to thinking cancer is one entity as opposed to hundreds of types, each with different diagnostics, prognosis and treatments, Ziyad Al-Aly, a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, told our writer Richard Sima, a former neuroscientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K32YAOJ4NVBTTEF4MSK3ULPFOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s why researchers are pressing ahead with new clinical trials for more targeted treatments built on advances in our understanding of long covid. And we’re learning more every day about the condition. “It is a constellation of many things, and dissecting out those things is going to be the biggest challenge,” said Janna Moen, a neuroscientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6UKG27ORFHQJABOZFNRXQZHBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Learn more here &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/16/long-covid-treatments-trial-immune-system/" target="_blank"&gt;about clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; that are underway to unravel all the long-covid subtypes and biological pathways that cause this devastating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="HLWMMVLSKNBBJPMEFN6OH7CQXU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="HLWMMVLSKNBBJPMEFN6OH7CQXU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why are colorectal cancer rates rising in young adults?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7GISK2JFOJDPXFRCUDOHSFGQ5E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our Ask a Doctor columnist is Trisha S.

But for younger adults, the trend is rapidly going in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6059239/#djw322-F1" target="_blank"&gt;wrong direction&lt;/a&gt;. While the overall numbers are still relatively low, colorectal cancer will become the leading cause of &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2778204" target="_blank"&gt;cancer-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; for adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s by 2030. In a study recently published in Nature, scientists unveiled a link between the rise in young colorectal cancers and a toxin called colibactin, which is produced by certain bacteria in the gut. Turns out, 30 to 40 percent of healthy adults have colibactin-producing bacteria, although only a small percentage of people get cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TRL4JEUVW5COXPPGFBF5IY73AI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Read more here from Trisha on the one thing you can do to help reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/05/19/why-colorectal-cancer-rising-young-people/" target="_blank"&gt;impact of colibactin&lt;/a&gt; on your digestive tract.

&lt;p&gt;One Ozempic user loves how her face looks after losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it’s become so normalized for people to lose weight using GLP-1 — many are suffering from its bizarre side effects, like “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/25/health/people-with-ozempic-face-are-doing-this-to-fight-wrinkles-and-sagging/"&gt;Ozempic face&lt;/a&gt;,”  except for a woman named Alejandra Salomon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salomon noticed a big difference in how her face looked after she took Semaglutide, a compound version of Ozempic, to lose weight for her sister’s wedding. 60 pounds lighter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many Ozempic users complain about their faces looking “hollowed out” or sagging — but Salomon experienced the opposite.
 &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jam Press/@actuallyal__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While experts will say that Ozempic and similar weight loss drugs “… make the face look much older,” Dr. Patrick Byrne, president of the &lt;a href="https://www.aafprs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery&lt;/a&gt; (AAFPRS), told The Post. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salomon — who is in her late twenties — feels the opposite. “My weight loss made me look 10 years younger – no Botox needed,” she told NeedToKnow.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While some Ozempic faces are appearing older with sunken cheeks, gaunt eyes and sagging neck skin — that doesn’t seem to be the case for Saloman as she’s thrilled with how young her face looks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It looks like I got jawline filler but really, I lost 60lbs and got in the best shape of my life,” she told NeedToKnow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 20-something-year-old started taking the weight loss drug “…because my parents thought it would be a good idea to lose 20lbs for my sister’s wedding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“It looks like I got jawline filler but really, I lost 60lbs and got in the best shape of my life,” she told NeedToKnow. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jam Press/@actuallyal__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It has without a doubt been the best decision for both my health and confidence,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salomon doesn’t view her slimmed-down face as a bad thing — if anything, she looks at it as a healthy change because she now thinks her once round face was a sign of inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She made sure to mention that although Semaglutide changed her life — it did come with some work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is not an easy solution and is not a magic trick. I started to eat so much protein and switch up my workouts,” she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Salomon said she is no longer on the medication but is still working hard to keep herself healthy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The 20-something-year-old is thrilled with how she looks. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jam Press/@actuallyal__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“…I am no longer on medication, and am maintaining my weight!”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Aside from the Ozempic face change, another alarming side effect from the weight loss drug is “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/health/ozempic-teeth-the-latest-alarming-side-effect-of-weight-loss-drugs/"&gt;Ozempic teeth&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those who use the GLP 1 might have experienced dental issues — such as dry mouth, bad breath and gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Ozempic might reduce saliva production, diminishing the mouth’s natural ability to cleanse teeth” — which can cause serious damage to one’s teeth,” Dr. Michele Green &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14731943/doctors-warn-Ozempic-teeth-effect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told the Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Saliva is crucial for protecting teeth, as it helps remove food particles, neutralizes acids produced by bacteria in the mouth and provides essential minerals that strengthen tooth enamel,” the expert said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/21/health/ozempic-teeth-the-latest-alarming-side-effect-of-weight-loss-drugs/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the CDC did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md#global-overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;closely watching&lt;/a&gt; the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a "significant increase" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While authorities in Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202505/15/P2025051500748.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; there is no evidence that the variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage of the virus, is more severe, they have begun urging residents to mask when in public transportation or crowded places as cases have climbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities in Taiwan have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Bulletin/Detail/r632O45d10BEHKwQhQVm8w?typeid=9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; a rise in emergency room visits, severe cases and deaths. Local health authorities say they are stockpiling vaccines and antiviral treatments in response to the epidemic wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1.full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in China suggest the NB.1.8.1 variant is not better at evading the immune system compared to other strains on the rise, but it does have a greater ability to bind to human cells, suggesting it could be more transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"A more predictable pattern"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX8rfa_f5o0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/food-and-drug-administration/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;'s outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/covid-19-vaccine/" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for the coming fall and winter seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines from &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-fall-2024-fda/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;last season&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries," Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer," Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain — a variant called XFC — has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past season only saw an evolutionary "drift" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future," the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rates of COVID-19 have now fallen back to low levels nationwide, measured through &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/activity-levels.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_3-emergency-department-visits-for-viral-respiratory-illness" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-nationaltrend.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;wastewater testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think after five years now, we are seeing very distinct patterns that [are] falling into a more predictable pattern," Thornburg said, citing a "seasonality analysis" that the agency has been working on about the virus. &lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: CC BY-SA 4.0)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/abstract/S1550-4131(23" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;00374-1) has found that cutting back on a single amino acid—isoleucine—can slow aging and help mice live longer. This surprising finding has caught the attention of scientists, raising hopes that similar dietary tweaks could one day boost human health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isoleucine, a type of branched-chain amino acid, helps the body build proteins. But there's a catch—it can't be made internally. Instead, it comes from foods like eggs, meat, dairy, and soy. While essential, too much of it might do more harm than good, especially over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies had already hinted at a link between isoleucine and body weight. Data collected from a 2016–2017 health survey in Wisconsin showed that people with higher BMIs tended to eat more isoleucine. That clue led researchers to take a closer look at how this amino acid affects the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different components of your diet have value and impact beyond their function as a calorie,” said Dudley Lamming, a metabolism expert from the &lt;a href="https://www.wisc.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of Wisconsin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; who is involved in both studies. “We've been digging in on one component that many people may be eating too much of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Study graphical abstract: Low-protein diets promote health and longevity in diverse species. (CREDIT: Cell Metabolism)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most exciting findings is that reducing isoleucine doesn’t just add years to life—it also improves “healthspan,” or the number of years lived in good health. Even older mice benefitted when the change was made later in life. That offers real hope for &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/common-hypertension-drug-slows-down-aging-and-can-increase-lifespan-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aging humans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;aging humans&lt;/a&gt; looking for new ways to stay healthier, longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their theory, scientists used mice with diverse genetic backgrounds and divided them into three groups. One group followed a standard diet with all 20 amino acids. The second had their intake of all &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/discoveries/all-life-on-earth-originated-from-a-single-common-ancestor-millions-of-years-ago/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amino acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; reduced by two-thirds. The third group had only isoleucine reduced by the same amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All mice were free to eat as much as they wanted, but only from their assigned diets. Despite eating freely, those with less isoleucine aged more slowly and showed better markers of health. That suggests it wasn’t about calories—it was about the specific nutrients consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study opens the door to new ways of thinking about nutrition and aging. With further research, scientists hope to see if cutting back on isoleucine can safely help humans live not just longer, but better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, restricting dietary isoleucine led to a host of positive effects on the mice's health and longevity. It increased their lifespan, improved their overall healthspan, reduced frailty, and promoted leanness and glycemic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice experienced a remarkable &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-senolytic-drugs-could-extend-human-lifespans-by-30/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:33 percent increase in lifespan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;33 percent increase in lifespan&lt;/a&gt; compared to their counterparts whose isoleucine intake was not restricted, while female mice enjoyed a 7 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mice exhibited significant improvements across 26 health measures, including enhanced muscle strength, endurance, better blood sugar control, improved tail function, and reduced hair loss. Notably, male mice in the low isoleucine group demonstrated less age-related prostate enlargement and a reduced likelihood of developing cancerous tumors—a common occurrence in diverse mouse strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected twist in the study was that the mice with restricted isoleucine consumption actually consumed more calories than their counterparts. Despite the increased caloric intake, they managed to burn more energy and maintain &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-genetic-variant-which-could-prevent-obesity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:leaner body weights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;leaner body weights&lt;/a&gt;, even though their physical activity levels remained unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Low Isoleucine Reduces Cancer Prevalence in Males.

		&lt;p&gt;A measles outbreak with its highest number of cases clustered in West Texas and New Mexico since the surge began in January is spilling into South and Central Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) confirmed a case of measles in Atascosa County, just south of San Antonio, on April 21, that was determined to be linked to the West Texas outbreak. The exposure was centered west of Poteet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, another case in Kyle was confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a population of about 63,000, Kyle is located in Hays County on the Interstate 35 corridor between San Marcos and Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cases are the closest San Antonio has come to a brush with the highly infectious disease since health authorities &lt;a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/west-texan-tests-positive-for-measles-after-visiting-utsa-river-walk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;warned in late February&lt;/a&gt; that a West Texas resident diagnosed with measles spent a weekend visit in San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jason Bowling, an infectious disease specialist and chief epidemiologist at University Health, said that while he is glad there has not been a case in Bexar County, it wouldn’t take much given the outbreaks nationwide and how contagious the pathogen really is — many times more than the COVID-19 virus, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, there are 1,024 confirmed measles cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thirty states have reported measles cases — that’s really high,” he said. “And globally, measles is higher right now, too. So that is concerning to me, that even though this measles case outbreak in Texas seems to be trickling down … it’s still worrisome that there are this many states involved, and most of these are imported cases,” originating from other areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anytime you have a case, there’s the risk that you’re going to have an intersection with a pocket of people or community that’s under-vaccinated, and you can have another flare-up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause &lt;a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/if-you-live-in-texas-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-recent-measles-outbreak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;life-threatening illness&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who is not protected against the virus. It is characterized by a flat red rash, and like other common respiratory illnesses, is accompanied by cough and congestion, watery eyes and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a measles outbreak, about 1 in 5 people who get sick will need medical care and 1 in 20 will develop pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In children, measles can lead to ear infections and pneumonia. In about 1 in 1,000 cases, the measles virus can infect the brain and spinal cord and cause encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and result in coma and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two children in Texas have already died in the last few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials maintain that the safest and most effective way to prevent measles is through vaccination, which came into widespread use in the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the MMR vaccine, for measles, mumps and rubella, be administered at 12 to 15 months of age, with a second dose at 4 to 6 years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent deadly measles outbreak in Texas appears to have driven an increase in the number of people who are vaccinated against measles, according to data from DSHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the data is incomplete because most people have not opted in to the Texas immunization registry, more than 320,000 people statewide have received the MMR vaccine since the start of the year versus over 277,000 in the first six months of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In West Texas where the outbreak is concentrated, that number doubled, from just over 7,500 to over 13,600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates in Atascosa County are among the highest in the state with 98.5% of kindergartners and 99% of seventh graders having received the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rates are slightly lower in Hays County, with 95% of kindergartners and 96% of seventh graders. Adult vaccination rates are not available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Antonio, health authorities are monitoring the outbreak, said a Metropolitan Health District spokeswoman, and continuing to educate the community about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, due to federal funding cuts, Metro Health &lt;a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/as-measles-spreads-federal-funding-cuts-force-metro-health-to-halt-vaccine-clinics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that free and low-cost vaccines soon will be a thing of the past at Metro Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the agency used a Federal Immunization Vaccines for Children Grant to assist 9,300 people and administer 22,400 vaccines. That comes to an end on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, parents can opt out of vaccinations for their children if they claim a conscientious exemption by submitting an affidavit form to the child’s school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the DSHS shows that the highest percentage rates of conscientious exemptions in Bexar County are mostly filed via private schools, which also have lower student enrollment compared to public school districts.&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;A school-aged child from Leander has tested positive for measles, Williamson County's public health department has confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Williamson County and Cities Health District said this is the first reported case of measles in the county this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was contagious starting last Thursday, May 15, and may continue to be through Saturday, May 24. They are currently recovering in isolation at home. The agency said &lt;a href="https://www.wcchd.org/news_detail_T4_R296.php" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt; it's working with school officials and the Texas Department of State Health Services to notify people who might have been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency didn't share information about what school the child attends, where they recently traveled to or their vaccination status. The family decided not to give certain details to health officials, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials are urging people who may have been exposed to monitor for &lt;a href="https://www.wcchd.org/healthy_people/measles.php" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;symptoms of measles&lt;/a&gt;, which include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, white spots inside the mouth and a skin rash. If symptoms develop, reach out to a health care provider before entering a hospital so health care workers can take appropriate steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are pregnant, have an infant or are immunocompromised should consider asking their health care provider about preemptive treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can lead to serious complications, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine provides the best protection against the virus; the standard two doses people are recommended to receive in childhood are 97% effective at preventing infection, according to the government agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hays County &lt;a href="https://www.kut.org/health/2025-05-20/hays-county-kyle-texas-measles-case" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its first measles case of the year on Tuesday.

&lt;h2 class="dek"&gt;First described by neurologist Constantin von Economo in 1917, encephalitis lethargica infected more than 1 million people — and killed an estimated 500,000.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="attachment_539247" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539247" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/encephalitis-lethargica.jpg" alt="Encephalitis Lethargica" class="size-full wp-image-539247 post-img-landscape" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/encephalitis-lethargica.jpg 900w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/encephalitis-lethargica-300x200.jpg 300w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/encephalitis-lethargica-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539247" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Paul Bernard Foley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;Patients with encephalitis lethargica, also known as “sleeping sickness” or “sleepy sickness.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="dropcaps"&gt;Between the mid-1910s and the 1930s, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica (EL) spread around the world, affecting more than 1 million people and leading to an estimated 500,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mysterious neurological disease baffled physicians, as those who were infected experienced a wide variety of symptoms, including extreme tiredness, sleep disturbances, fevers, headaches, muscle pains, vision issues, psychiatric changes, and sometimes even symptoms resembling Parkinson’s disease. While many victims died of respiratory failure soon after being infected, some survivors suffered a far worse fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people who contracted EL eventually developed severe neurological disorders, like post-encephalitic Parkinsonism, and in the most extreme cases, victims were left with an immobile face, rigid muscles, and an inability to interact normally with other people. This left them in an almost statue-like state or puppet-like state — with their minds still active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the spread of encephalitis lethargica happened around the same time as the &lt;a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/1918-flu-pandemic" target="_blank"&gt;Spanish flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, researchers initially believed that there may have been a link between the two conditions, but this was never conclusively proven. The exact cause of EL remains unknown to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more strangely, the disease seems to have vanished just as mysteriously as it appeared, barring a handful of isolated cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Emergence Of Encephalitis Lethargica&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_539244" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539244" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spanish-flu-camp-funston.jpg" alt="Spanish Flu At Camp Funston" class="size-full wp-image-539244 post-img-landscape" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spanish-flu-camp-funston.jpg 900w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spanish-flu-camp-funston-300x225.jpg 300w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/spanish-flu-camp-funston-768x575.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539244" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Public Domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;Patients being treated for the Spanish flu at Camp Funston in Kansas. Circa 1918. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sudden emergence of EL was one of the biggest medical mysteries of the early 20th century. Some of the first cases began cropping up as early as 1916 (or perhaps even 1915), but it wasn’t until 1917 that the Austrian neurologist Constantin von Economo identified a unique pattern of symptoms among patients in Vienna. Around the same time, French physician Jean-René Cruchet reported similar cases in France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the similarities with the symptoms, however, no one could find a definitive common cause or method of transmission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the world was still in the throes of &lt;a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/ww1-photos" target="_blank"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt; at the time. And then, in the postwar period, even more death followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1918, the H1N1 influenza known as the Spanish flu rapidly spread across the planet and affected over one-fourth of the global population. When cases of EL were appearing at the same time, it was a natural assumption that it was perhaps some horrendous side effect of the flu. But there was never any direct link established between EL and the Spanish flu virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to find a cause was made even more complicated, as Dr. Heidi Moawad noted in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurologylive.com/view/encephalitis-lethargica-still-unexplained-sleeping-sickness" target="_blank"&gt;NeurologyLive&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; since not all patients had the same symptoms or the same level of severity with their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“According to the medical literature, about a third of the patients died from respiratory failure caused by neurological dysfunction,” Moawad explained. “And, while at least hundreds [of] thousands of patients died, there were at least as many who survived. Some of the survivors exhibited residual Parkinsonian or neuropsychiatric sequelae.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, a potential connection between Parkinson’s and EL was likewise explored, yet once again there was no definitive link. Others theorized that EL was caused by an autoimmune condition or streptococcal infection, but the disease’s true origins still haven’t been discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental and societal factors such as &lt;a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/albert-kahn-ww1-photographs" target="_blank"&gt;World War I&lt;/a&gt;, crowded living spaces, and global travel may have facilitated the spread of the disease, but these factors still would have only influenced the likeliness of infection rather than revealed the actual origin of encephalitis lethargica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Uncovering The Mysterious “Sleeping Sickness”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Constantin von Economo of the Psychiatric-Neurological Clinic of the University of Vienna examined patients in late 1916 who had been presenting odd neurological symptoms. According to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/8/2246/3970828" target="_blank"&gt;an &lt;em&gt;Oxford Academic&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; by Leslie A. Hoffman and Joel A. Vilensky, those patients had been admitted with diagnoses ranging from meningitis to multiple sclerosis to delirium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, none of the diagnoses truly aligned with any known diagnostic scheme — and the presence of notable lethargy among each patient suggested a common affliction that didn’t seem to fit a known illness. Von Economo believed that this required the description of a new disease, which he outlined in a 1917 manuscript titled &lt;em&gt;Encephalitis Lethargica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another physician, Jean-René Cruchet, had been treating similar cases in France in a military hospital and published his own description of the disease around the same time as von Economo. Researchers eventually found that EL presented itself in two phases, one acute and one chronic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researcher Paul Foley summarized the stages (and added a third stage) in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-viral-infection-of-the-mind-the-curious-case-of-encephalitis-lethargica-660" target="_blank"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, explaining that in the first phase, patients experienced general unease, double vision, extreme drowsiness, and sometimes a fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The second phase was marked by a general loss of concentration and interest in life, giving a vague sensation that the patient was not the person they had once been,” Foley wrote. “But this period, which resembled chronic fatigue syndrome, was the calm before the storm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_539250" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539250" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/die-encephalitis-lethargica-illustration.jpg" alt="Encephalitis Lethargica Illustration" class="size-full wp-image-539250 post-img-landscape" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/die-encephalitis-lethargica-illustration.jpg 614w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/die-encephalitis-lethargica-illustration-300x274.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539250" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Public Domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;An illustration by Constantin von Economo, showing the brain tissue of a monkey with encephalitis lethargica. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time — which could have been anywhere between a few days and decades — some patients developed post-encephalitic parkinsonism (PEP), a potential third phase of the disease. It was an irreversible condition that effectively disabled sufferers for the rest of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients contracted encephalitis lethargica as children. If they were infected between ages 5 and 10, they might eventually experience “pathologic changes of character that approached the psychopathic.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this may have looked somewhat like attention deficit disorders: restlessness, an inability to focus, clinginess, and so on. But as these children grew older, their impulsive behaviors could potentially lead to violent outbursts that posed a serious threat to themselves and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Errant behaviours included cruelty to anyone who crossed them; destructiveness; lying; and self-mutilation including, in one example, removal of eyes,” Paul Foley explained. “When they reached adolescence, these patients manifested inappropriate and excessive sexuality, including sexual assault without regard for age or gender.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More curiously, these dangerous behaviors were seemingly done purely out of impulse rather than selfishness. Patients often showed genuine remorse for what they had done and said that they had simply felt compelled to behave in the way they did. Unfortunately, some of them continued to let that impulse drive them well into adulthood, only to eventually fall victim to the Parkinsonism that put them in the statue-like state that came to characterize the most severe forms of encephalitis lethargica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, these severely affected patients lost all willpower and sense of emotional connection. Music no longer moved them, even if they could recognize a musician’s skill. Despite some feeling empathy, they could no longer properly express sympathy. Their minds remained active, but they were incapable of normally interacting with the world as they once had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, it may have seemed like countless people would be doomed to suffer this terrible fate. But then, as suddenly as it had swept across the globe, encephalitis lethargica started to vanish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Happened To Encephalitis Lethargica?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_539242" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-539242" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis.jpg" alt="Woman Suffering From Encephalitis Lethargica" class="size-full wp-image-539242 post-img-portrait" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis.jpg 800w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis-241x300.jpg 241w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis-724x900.jpg 724w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aj-hall-epidemic-encephalitis-768x955.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-539242" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Public Domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;A woman suffering from EL is stuck holding her arms in the air.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EL epidemic reached its peaks during the early 1920s, but by 1927, cases had started to dwindle. According to the &lt;em&gt;Oxford Academic&lt;/em&gt; article, a report in 1929 listed around 80 treatments for EL that had been attempted during the epidemic, none of which proved to be particularly effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that specific report, one-third of patients who contracted EL died during the acute phase, one-third survived without any further complications, and the final third fell victim to later neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since 1940, there have only been around 80 published reports of EL worldwide. There have been some mild successes in treatments — namely with the Parkinson’s medication Levodopa (or L-DOPA), which was mentioned in British neurologist Oliver Sacks’ famous book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Revenirea_la_viata/Zu_UEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;pg=PT6&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank"&gt;Awakenings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The book later inspired a 1990 movie starring Robert De Niro as a patient recovering from the effects of the disease after decades of being in a shut-down state and &lt;a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/robin-williams-death" target="_blank"&gt;Robin Williams&lt;/a&gt; as the doctor who was helping him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_543345" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-543345" src="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/awakenings-movie.jpg" alt="Awakenings Movie" class="size-full wp-image-543345 post-img-landscape" srcset="https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/awakenings-movie.jpg 900w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/awakenings-movie-300x190.jpg 300w, https://allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/awakenings-movie-768x486.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-543345" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Columbia Pictures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption-body"&gt;Robert De Niro and Robin Williams in the 1990 movie &lt;em&gt;Awakenings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sacks described the most severely affected EL patients as “extinct volcanoes” that “erupted into life” thanks to L-DOPA, but it turned out that his celebration was presumptuous. What actually happened was that L-DOPA only managed to help EL patients for a period of several months, after which they experienced adverse effects like tics and emotional instability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, some doctors have suggested that electroconvulsive therapy could prove effective for some patients, but with limited data to go on and mixed results, it can’t be said to be a cure. Even now, more than a century after it first emerged, there is no cure for encephalitis lethargica. Nor can anyone explain why the disease appeared and faded away like it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this day, the EL epidemic remains one of the biggest medical mysteries of the 20th century. And some fear it could possibly return someday.&lt;/p&gt;

As of 2024, approximately 5.7 million people are doing the same, according to a study by KFF Health Track. Yet, the short-term benefits of this injectable drug are currently being outweighed by a very serious&lt;a href="https://wwd.com/pop-culture/culture-news/what-is-ozempic-face-1235532396/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:potential side effect;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; potential side effect&lt;/a&gt; that has become so common that it has earned a nickname online: Ozempic teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More from WWD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Ozempic Teeth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ozempic teeth refers to the deterioration of oral health seen within prescription semaglutide users. Videos from certified dentists and Ozempic users posted on TikTok and Instagram suggest issues with oral health – such as tooth decay, bad breath and bleeding or irritated gums – may be a result of symptoms of the drug such as dry mouth, acid reflux and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Symptoms of Ozempic May Lead to Dental Issues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Dr. Sandip Sachar, a Manhattan-based dentist, there is no scientific evidence to suggest Ozempic can lead to oral health complications, however, people taking GLP-1 medications tend to drink less water, which has subsequently led to the presence of dry mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“One of the ways that GLP-1 medications work is by reducing or slowing the emptying of the GI (gastrointestinal) contents,” she told WWD. “This is more prevalent in emptying of foods that are consumed but also can affect liquids that are consumed. Slowing of GI emptying may prevent hunger but also may prevent thirst.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When a person experiences dry mouth, it means there’s less protective saliva being produced to help “neutralize acidic foods and drinks, wash away food debris and decreased plaque buildup,” Sachar explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Bacteria in plaque as well as acidic foods and drinks can erode tooth enamel leading to tooth decay and more severe problems down the road,” she said. “In addition to tooth decay, other symptoms include increased tooth sensitivity to hot and cold, enamel erosion, tooth fractures, receding gums, generalized oral discomfort and acid reflux.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meghan Garcia-Webb, a board-certified obesity medicine doctor, listed acid reflux and vomiting as other potential side effects of GLP-1 medications that could cause oral health issues. “That can be very damaging to the teeth,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If these become chronic problems, then, of course, they can be more damaging to the teeth, throat and esophagus,” Garcia-Web noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Poor Oral Health Can Be Prevented&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is all not to say dental and oral hygiene issues are guaranteed with weight loss treatment. In fact, the prescribing doctor can help catch these symptoms before they make their way to the mouth. Garcia-Webb said decreasing a patient’s dose, switching them to a different medication or starting them on an additional one to “help with nausea or excess stomach acid” can help manage the side effects.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additional measures to avoid oral complications should also be taken, according to Sachar. “I recommend that they maintain good oral hygiene with twice a day brushing with a fluoride toothpaste, and flossing every day. They should consume enough water to stay hydrated and prevent dry mouth,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also suggested chewing sugar-free gum to increase saliva production and actively avoiding acidic or sugary drinks, as well as sticky foods and candy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For anyone already exhibiting signs of Ozempic teeth, Sachar said frequent dental cleanings are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best of WWD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sign up for &lt;a href="https://cloud.email.wwd.com/signup/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:WWD's Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;WWD's Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.

The health department also didn’t say what age range the juvenile was in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If not immune, people exposed to measles could develop symptoms between May 17 and June 2, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, a rash that usually starts on the face and moves to chest and back, and red watery eyes, according to the health department. The highly contagious respiratory illness can be&lt;a href="https://health.alaska.gov/en/education/measles/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; dangerous or fatal&lt;/a&gt;, especially for babies or children, but the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine provides effective immunity, according to state health officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Most children in Alaska are &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2025/01/17/state-confirms-measles-case-in-alaskan-who-traveled-overseas/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;vaccinated against measles&lt;/a&gt;: As of the end of last year, about 79% of Alaska kids between 19 and 35 months old had gotten one dose of the MMR vaccine, and 83% of kids between 5 and 18 years old had received a second dose, according to the state’s immunization program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This year, the United States has seen more than 1,000 cases of measles and three deaths, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Why%20are%20some%20fully%20vaccinated,have%20seen%20in%20previous%20years." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, including large outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico.

			&lt;p&gt;Humans are not yet done cooking. We're continuing to evolve and adjust to the world around us, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/legendary-female-free-divers-reveal-evolution-in-action-on-south-korean-island"&gt;records of our adaptations written in our bodies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that there are some environments that can make us unwell. Mountain climbers often succumb to &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/altitude-sickness"&gt;altitude sickness&lt;/a&gt; – the body's reaction to a significant drop in atmospheric pressure, which means less oxygen is taken in with each breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, in high altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau, where oxygen levels in the air people breathe are notably lower than lower altitudes, human communities thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the more than 10,000 years the region has been settled, the bodies of those living there have changed in ways that allow the inhabitants to make the most of an atmosphere that for most humans would result in not enough oxygen being delivered via blood cells to the body's tissues, a condition known as hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GV5m1wNCJRg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia is fascinating because the stress is severe, experienced equally by everyone at a given altitude, and quantifiable," anthropologist Cynthia Beall of Case Western Reserve University in the US told ScienceAlert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a beautiful example of how and why our species has so much biological variation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beall has been studying the human response to hypoxic living conditions &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0701985104"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;. In research published in October 2024, she and her team unveiled some of the specific adaptations in Tibetan communities: traits that help the blood deliver oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unlock this discovery, the researchers delved into one of the markers of what we call evolutionary fitness: reproductive success. Women who deliver live babies are those who pass on their traits to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traits that maximize an individual's success in a given environment are most likely to be found in women who are able to survive the stresses of pregnancy and childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141134" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141134" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang.jpg" alt="We're Watching Humans Evolve Right Before Our Very Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau" class="size-full wp-image-141134" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/lo-monthang-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141134" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lo Manthang in Nepal, where some of the data was collected. (&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1061935"&gt;James J. Yu&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These women are more likely to give birth to more babies; and those babies, having inherited survivability traits from their mothers, are also more likely to survive to adulthood, and pass the traits on to the next generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's natural selection at work, and it can be a bit strange and counterintuitive; in places where  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/malaria" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73073" data-postid="162437" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; is common, for example, the incidence of sickle cell anemia is high, because it &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(11)00384-9"&gt;involves a gene that protects against malaria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beall and her team made a study of 417 women between the ages of 46 and 86 years who have lived all their lives in Nepal above altitudes of around 3,500 meters (11,480 feet). The researchers recorded the number of live births, ranging between 0 and 14 per woman for an average of 5.2, as well as health and physical information and measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the things they measured were levels of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"&gt;hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;, the protein in red blood cells responsible for delivering oxygen to tissues. They also measured how much oxygen was being carried by the hemoglobin. Interestingly, the women who demonstrated the highest rate of live births had hemoglobin levels that were neither high nor low, but average for the testing group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin was high. Together, the results suggest that the adaptations are able to maximize oxygen delivery to cells and tissues without thickening the blood – a result that would place more stress on the heart as it struggles to pump a higher viscosity fluid more resistant to flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141135" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141135" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin.jpg" alt="We're Watching Humans Evolve Right Before Our Very Eyes on The Tibetan Plateau" class="size-full wp-image-141135" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin-552x415.jpg 552w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/hemoglobin-600x451.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141135" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The noninvasive measurement of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation. (&lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/evolution-in-action-how-ethnic-tibetan-women-thrive-in-thin-oxygen-at-high-altitudes/"&gt;Sienna R. Craig&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previously we knew that lower hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that an intermediate value has the highest benefit. We knew that higher oxygen saturation of hemoglobin was beneficial, now we understand that the higher the saturation the more beneficial. The number of live births quantifies the benefits," Beall said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was unexpected to find that women can have many live births with low values of some oxygen transport traits if they have favorable values of other oxygen transport traits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The women with the highest reproductive success rate also had a high rate of blood flow into the lungs, and their hearts had wider than average left ventricles, the chamber of the heart responsible for pumping oxygenated blood into the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken all together, these traits increase the rate of oxygen transport and delivery, enabling the human body to make the most of the low oxygen in the air respired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that cultural factors can play a role, too. Women who start reproducing young and have long marriages seem to have a longer exposure to the possibility of pregnancy, which also increases the number of live births, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even taking that into account, however, the physical traits played a role. Nepalese women with physiologies most similar to women in unstressed, low altitude environments tended to have the highest rate of reproductive success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a case of ongoing natural selection," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/evolution-in-action-how-ethnic-tibetan-women-thrive-in-thin-oxygen-at-high-altitudes/"&gt;Beall said&lt;/a&gt;. "Understanding how populations like these adapt gives us a better grasp of the processes of human evolution."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2403309121"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in October 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These molecules, absent in adult depression, may signal unique biological processes in adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used a minimally invasive method involving dried blood spots, making it practical for broader screening applications. This breakthrough could lead to more objective, early diagnosis of teen depression, before symptoms become severe or treatment-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Biomarkers:&lt;/strong&gt; Nine microRNAs elevated in depressed teens were not found in adult depression cases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimally Invasive Testing:&lt;/strong&gt; Dried blood spots from finger pricks enable scalable, long-term sample collection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Biomarkers could identify at-risk teens before clinical symptoms are reported.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;McGill University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a novel lab method they developed, McGill University researchers have identified nine molecules in the blood that were elevated in teens diagnosed with depression.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alarmingly, more and more adolescents are being diagnosed with depression, and when it starts early, the effects can be long-lasting and severe,” said senior author Cecilia Flores, James McGill Professor in McGill’s Department of Psychiatry, a researcher at the Douglas Research Centre and a principal investigator at the Ludmer Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Teens with depression are more likely to struggle with substance use, social isolation and experience symptoms that often don’t respond well to treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the nine molecules – known as microRNAs – have not been linked to adult depression, suggesting they reflect biological processes unique to teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A minimally invasive and scalable approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, conducted in collaboration with colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles and Stanford University, focused on 62 teenagers: 34 with depression and 28 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected small volumes of blood samples, let them dry, and then froze the samples to preserve molecular integrity over time. Such samples are taken with a simple finger prick and are easy to store and transport, making the approach practical and scalable for broader use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The McGill team developed the lab method used to extract and analyze microRNAs from the samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings pave the way for using dried blood spots as a practical tool in psychiatric research, allowing us to track early biological changes linked to mental health using a minimally invasive method,” said first author Alice Morgunova, postdoctoral fellow at McGill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing depression mostly relies on self-reported symptoms. The authors say this could delay care, especially if teens don’t recognize the signs or aren’t ready to talk about them. A blood-based screening tool could provide an additional and more objective metric to identify teens at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to validate their findings in larger groups of adolescents and to study how these microRNAs interact with genetic and environmental risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peripheral microRNA signatures in adolescent depression” by Alice Morgunova and Cecilia Flores et al., was published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Douglas Foundation and Bombardier Fund grant, the National Institute on Drug Abuse of NIH, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, a Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives Graduate Student Fellowship, an Integrated Program in Neuroscience Internal Award, and Postdoctoral Fellowship from the McGill-Douglas Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry International Collaborative Initiative in Adversity and Mental Health, an international partnership funded by the Canada First Research Excellence Fund, awarded to McGill University for the Healthy Brains for Healthy Lives initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b202e22272a652f2e3b2a3b2e0b26282c22272765282a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Keila DePape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mcgill.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;McGill University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Keila DePape – McGill University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2025.100505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Peripheral microRNA signatures in adolescent depression&lt;/a&gt;” by Cecilia Flores et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry Global Open Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peripheral microRNA signatures in adolescent depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescent depression is linked to enduring maladaptive outcomes, chronic severity of symptoms, and poor treatment response. Identifying epigenetic signatures of adolescent depression is urgently needed to improve early prevention and intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs are epigenetic regulators of adolescent neurodevelopmental processes, but their role as markers and mediators of adolescent depression is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we examined microRNA profiles from dried blood spot samples of clinically depressed and psychiatrically healthy male and female adolescents. We processed and sequenced these samples using a small RNA protocol tailored for microRNA identification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified nine differentially expressed (DE) microRNAs (adjusted p-value &amp;lt; 0.05), all of which upregulated in adolescents with depression. At future follow-ups post blood collection, expression of miR-3613-5p, mir-30c-2 and miR-942-5p positively associated with depression severity but not anxiety, suggesting a stronger link to persistent depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expression of miR-32-5p correlated inversely with hippocampal volume, highlighting a potential neurobiological basis. Common predicted gene targets of the DE microRNAs are involved in neurodevelopment, cognitive processing, and depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings lay the groundwork for identifying adolescent peripheral microRNA markers that reflect neurodevelopmental pathways shaping lifelong psychopathology risk.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 21:10:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9QazN6TUIxMXdwMDdfbDhnV3d4YmtPZHFzSVNWTGQ5MlBVeFh2dzJwRWxveGFZNEdWX3VTcmw2OElFZko0WnBzYWVJYkF0UDg5THVYcVluVElyXy1oY2gwQS1WQk1tMUlfUGcxaHpBRQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，与酒精有关的癌症死亡人数正在迅速上升- ABC新闻 | Cancer deaths tied to alcohol are rising fast, study finds - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQQlctNnpOaU93N2t1dmY3ckE3RU9JNnZST3lQNEs2dGRoWTVuU2dwSWkyYm9obFFhdmQ4TjJJUW12MExlOWFpS3lWcmNTM09GdDVZYy1LYmltR2NLd3duWG1QaVNnRDBpWGZWdnRQTlo5ekhBR2h4eUhHejFtQzdKS3diY1pQUDNGSjF1U2E2eTk5M3Y4bVNfbjFxRdIBoAFBVV95cUxOSUdUbkNYVmxMbEhCeFhaemo3cVBDOWl6Z0cxcFE5SFdLeDBQaWpsdldtWlRuSVR4cXMzVkdZcEZ4OWxEdUY1WDl2akxHTTF3X2ZQS2tnemgyMVh5cnhseVJsUU9kcnpmUzF2TGs0Znl2SFpnR1V4NXdxdmFQY29CeUh6b2xXQkN3NldjYVdjX05XQ19pWUo3WXJ6OWtYbWJX?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Alcohol associated cancer deaths have doubled in the United States over the past three decades, disproportionately impacting men and people 55 and older, according to a new, yet to be published, study being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual conference this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The analysis of national death rates attributable to alcohol use between 1990 to 2021 found a significant increase from 11,896 to 23,207 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We already know other risk factors, such as tobacco, for cancer," Dr. Chinmay Jani, the study's lead author and a clinical fellow in hematology and oncology at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, told ABC News.

&lt;p&gt;It found that taking vitamin D supplements for four years managed to prevent three years’ worth of ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have hinted that vitamin D supplements can help combat some of the biggest signs of ageing, which are linked to many age-related diseases such as cancer, heart disease and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put this theory to the test, researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.augusta.edu/mcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medical College of Georgia&lt;/a&gt; studied the results of a previous trial. That experiment enlisted thousands of women over 55 and men over 50, asking them to take a daily dose of either vitamin D, omega 3 or a placebo for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p purpleid="15ac4953-2704-4a78-b46c-cdd380f95e67"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study focused on 1054 participants who had special tests at the beginning of the trial, at Year 2 and Year 4, measuring the length of their telomeres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are repeating sequences of DNA that cap chromosomes, &lt;a href="https://icmm.ku.dk/english/research-groups/scheibye-knudsen-group/"&gt;Professor Morten Schiebye-Knudsen&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Copenhagen, who wasn’t involved with the study, explained to &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus Magazine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/41/2025/05/nopparit-GettyImages-1919015704-1.jpg?webp=1&amp;amp;w=1200" alt="X chromosome with the tops coloured red" class="wp-image-202705"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes, preventing them from fusing together or unravelling - Credit: Getty Images/nopparit&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Think of them as the plastic tips on the ends of shoelaces – they prevent chromosomes from fraying or sticking to each other, which helps maintain the stability of genetic information during cell division,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time a cell divides, the telomeres get a little shorter. When the telomeres become too short, they lose their ability to divide, meaning their cells can no longer function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that participants who took vitamin D experienced considerably less telomere shortening, preventing the equivalent of almost three years of ageing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be a key insight into keeping people healthy longer, as telomere shortening is linked to many age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I often refer to them as angry old men – cells that have lost their function in life, become inactive and make the environment around them bad,” said Schiebye-Knudsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Telomere shortening may contribute to more angry old cells and therefore more inflammation in our body, particularly in cells that divide a lot, like our bone marrow, skin and hair.”&lt;/p&gt;

We can treat a lot of cancers, and we’re getting better at that, but this is really driving home the point that people are dying from cancer due to alcohol,” said Jane Figueiredo, a professor of medicine at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The study focused on seven alcohol-related cancers: breast, liver, colorectal, throat, voice box, mouth and esophageal. Alcohol isn’t responsible for every case of these cancers, but it has been shown to be a driving factor in a percentage of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“When people think about alcohol, they don’t necessarily think of it as being a carcinogen like they do tobacco,” said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of public health and community medicine at the Tufts University School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But it is. Once in the body, alcohol breaks down into &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;acetaldehyde&lt;/a&gt; — a carcinogen also found in tobacco smoke. Alcohol damages DNA and makes it easier for the mouth and throat to absorb other carcinogens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The International Agency on Cancer Research, a branch of the World Health Organization, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;classified alcohol&lt;/a&gt; as a carcinogen in 1987. Research&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at that time linked drinking to cancers of the head and neck (including the mouth, throat, voice box and esophagus) and liver cancers. It’s since been linked to breast and colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A January &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/alcohol-cancer-risk-warning-surgeon-general-report-rcna186095" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the former U.S. surgeon general said alcoholic drinks should come with cancer warning labels. According to WHO, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news-room/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health" target="_blank"&gt;no safe amount&lt;/a&gt; of alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The new research found that in 1991, 2.5% of all cancer deaths in men and 1.46% in women were related to alcohol. In 2021, those percentages rose to 4.2% and 1.85%, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Over that same time period, men saw a 56% increase in deaths from alcohol-related cancers specifically. For women, it was nearly 8%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was not surprising that it was higher in men, but it was certainly surprising how much higher it was in men versus women,” said study co-leader Dr. Chinmay Jani, chief fellow of hematology and oncology at the University of Miami’s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Historically, men have tended to start drinking alcohol earlier in life, Jani and his team noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, sex-based drinking habits appear to be shifting. In recent years, an increasing number of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/women-us-are-drinking-death-research-finds-rcna96848" target="_blank"&gt;women have become heavy drinkers&lt;/a&gt;, and slightly more young women binge drink than men, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832889?guestAccessKey=d47ec1d7-0eea-48ee-a6ad-a9356c6b5f85&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041625" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Deaths from the seven alcohol-related cancers increased among men in 47 states, and in 16 states for women. In both groups, deaths among people living in New Mexico rose the most — nearly 60% for men and 18% for women. Oklahoma, for men, and Tennessee, for women, came in close second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Washington D.C. and New York saw the biggest decreases for men, and Massachusetts and New York for women. Utah remained the state with the lowest alcohol-related cancer deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cancer deaths were highest among people 55 and older. In men in this age group, alcohol-related cancer deaths rose by more than 1% every year between 2007 and 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The carcinogenic effect probably isn’t affecting you right away in your younger age, but as you continue to drink as you age, this carcinogen has an accumulative effect on the body,” Jani said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Of all seven alcohol-related cancers, liver, colorectal and esophageal cancers were the deadliest overall in 2021. In men specifically, liver cancer deaths were most common. For women, it was breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We know that even small amounts of alcohol can affect the breast tissue,” Figueiredo said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Jani said the next phase of research should tease out how different racial and ethnic groups are affected by alcohol differently when it comes to cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is lower in some ethnic groups than others, so acetaldehyde, the carcinogen in alcohol, is higher in these people,” Jani said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Alcohol consumption in the U.S. hit its peak in the late 1970s and dropped until the late ‘90s, data from the &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance-reports/surveillance120" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism&lt;/a&gt; show.

Every person has the autonomy to make their own decisions,” Siegel said. “But we want to make sure they are well-informed based on the facts rather than misconceptions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQUkFxdENaN0NDRW1NT3hMV1JzSTBTT29TbjJRNGZ1QlUwTV9UUktZQU5sSjczclNWMVp4bXZycVNXMERaSkRhMllFeVliaUticW14RGFQbGJ6Z3oyR2hWaC1tT2tCcVNkRl9sZUtkaFRyQ1lVUnZyQ3FpeGdCQjd0d0FoSFJjVFR3YXpOa0t30gFWQVVfeXFMTXVoczdPdVhkZ3BMT2FUaUlnREJiQ1QtclU0cE5ZemctQ0w5Qlk4V1NKMVMxRk1oTEpOb2tneTRfMGtjZWxxTG9YZlU2WnkxaHIxcl9PNHc</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，维生素D可能会减缓与衰老相关的过程-《华盛顿邮报》 | Vitamin D may slow a process related to aging, new study suggests - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNS3dReThmRFBEcTRvelhTZ0tGNUowT0lxdHE3SUdCM2VBWEV2b2JETjFHVzcxMnpoMFlvRlR6b2ZMNHRXSkVsQlhnNzB6QTZ0UkNwZnVULTZ3Y0hDaWJrd01jYmdOTkYzaHdzblZ0S2FXdHQ5QlU3SnlWTTJuTkJhWmtabnl2djI3eXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="I77BVWH4TVF7NJREDLXXTEVQVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People who have a higher vitamin D intake may be slowing down a biological process linked to aging, according to &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00255-2/abstract"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H5SY23A24BBDBE7IFLRCVRLBCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But don’t rush out to buy supplements just yet. The findings need to be confirmed with additional research, and the vast majority of people in the United States are already &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/12/vitamin-d-supplement-deficiency-covid/"&gt;getting enough vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; from diet and sunlight, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RVX4X7J6YZELDOYNPF5X32IPJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the new analysis, researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and other universities looked at telomeres — the protective caps of DNA code at the ends of chromosomes — which tend to shorten as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GERJYXPHRGOVBHJJI766IVKG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s a biological “clock” of sorts, and shorter telomeres have been linked to an increased risk of certain diseases. Vitamin D supplements, though, may slow that shrinking process, the new research, published in the &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00255-2/fulltext"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7BH5A5GKNVAT7CIJ3GD2LJ6DAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While previous studies have shown an association between vitamin D and telomere length, most were observational.

It involves 25,871 participants — U.S. women age 55 and older and men age 50 and older — who have been given 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3 a day and 1 gram of Omega 3 fatty acid a day to determine their effects primarily on cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DUSRLXLG4FHQNG2JHP2QRWV3V4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The telomere study focused on about 900 of those participants, largely from Boston, whose telomere length in white blood cells was assessed at baseline and again in years 2 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JYQUW5W3BVDMPJX6IDZNJTDEOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers found that compared with the group taking the placebo, those taking vitamin D supplements had reduced telomere shortening over four years. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation, on the other hand, had no obvious effect on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="S4VHXBMF2VDTNEDXL3KBJ4YNRA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="S4VHXBMF2VDTNEDXL3KBJ4YNRA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How telomeres may be associated with aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ISVJKZN2M5DU5H3ZC35TR24YMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During each cell division, telomeres ensure that the cell’s chromosomes do not fuse with one another or rearrange themselves, and with each replication, the telomeres shorten a bit. This process is associated with aging as well as an increased risk of infections, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MXSVZOCGP5DYPJJTRKBJSX32EU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers think that vitamin D supplementation’s benefit is related to tamping down inflammation, Manson said. Inflammation has been associated with autoimmune diseases as well as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZX73D7LDNFHKVGMWNMTY4JNXLU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZX73D7LDNFHKVGMWNMTY4JNXLU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Healthy diet and lifestyle are critical&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UQQQGUHTMZFDXDBB3DADTJ72TM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While vitamin D may have benefits, Manson emphasized that it is not a cure-all. There are many chronic diseases that do not seem to be reduced by vitamin D supplementation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7265VQYKSZBCDH44R3MODZUKXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Dietary supplements will never be a substitute for healthy diet and healthy lifestyle, and we've made it very clear time and again that the focus should be on the diet and lifestyle rather than on supplementation,” she said. “However, targeted supplementation for people who have higher levels of inflammation or a higher risk of chronic diseases clearly related to inflammation, those high risk groups may benefit from targeted vitamin D supplementation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C2Y6A47X7ZD73AEPKLG5LZXGTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The telomere study was randomized, meaning participants were randomly assigned to either the vitamin D supplement group or the placebo group to ensure that characteristics such as age, health status, diet and lifestyle are balanced between the groups. Randomization is considered the gold standard in clinical research because it makes the groups as similar as possible at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E26MIEAO6JDLBM5PUXMVD5JEUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“All of the risk factors for chronic disease, for telomere shortening, the age, the demographics, the physical activity, diet, underlying health, hypertension, diabetes, all these risk factors are balanced out by the randomization process,” Manson said, meaning the only difference between the two groups was that one received vitamin D and one did not. And the study was also “double-blinded,” meaning that not only did the participants in each group not know which was receiving the supplement, but neither did the technicians administering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="NRK27DIADJEEVH3YNQRLR36APU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NRK27DIADJEEVH3YNQRLR36APU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What other research and experts say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DWHE56MJ55HGZOMMY6ZCWJPJBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not all studies have been as promising with regard to telomere preservation. A paper published in 2023 in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging, for instance, concluded that “routinely supplementing older adults, who are largely vitamin D replete, with monthly doses of vitamin D is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770723002312"&gt;unlikely to influence telomere length&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NLOM6FBBRNFEVEUGQWOT2LKTXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between 2014 and 2020, researchers at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, Australia, led a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 1,519 participants, to see whether vitamin D supplementation would affect telomere length. They gave the supplement monthly to half of the participants and found no difference between those who received it and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DP67S2RPWBBMHAF36OI4B62CCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greiderlab.org/people/index.html"&gt;Carol Greider&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for her discovery of telomerase, an enzyme that protects telomeres from shortening, said in an email that she was skeptical of the new study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="53Z7YL5UBJFF7JOMQE6CP2S5W4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, an assay that was used in the recent study to measure telomere length, has been shown in a number of publications to be unreliable, Greider wrote. The clinical standard for measuring telomere length is a technique called Flow FISH, which is highly reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EQUXXRAAUJHTVOS2Z52BA3EZMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Greider also noted that different subtypes of blood cells have different telomere lengths, so any changes in the cell type distribution in the blood could raise or lower the blood’s average telomere length, not because the length changed but because the types of cells present changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GDRCK4CERJBVTFQ52RJHMX3W74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She cited a&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70030"&gt; perspective published in Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt; in March, in which the authors question research from 2024 that suggested spaceflight, like the Inspiration4 mission, which lasted just three days, increased the average telomere length of the white blood cells of those on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="27IELRT4MVAQ3MCB6V22HLUJNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s not that the telomeres are longer, the authors of the Aging Cell article wrote; it’s that the composition of their white blood cells changed, raising the average telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7VHOXREM6RBCTFTJGYBUFAIDLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“So while there may or may not be an effect of Vitamin D on telomeres, the methods used in this study are unlikely to be able to accurately document those changes without any control for cell type distributions,” Greider wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 20:23:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNS3dReThmRFBEcTRvelhTZ0tGNUowT0lxdHE3SUdCM2VBWEV2b2JETjFHVzcxMnpoMFlvRlR6b2ZMNHRXSkVsQlhnNzB6QTZ0UkNwZnVULTZ3Y0hDaWJrd01jYmdOTkYzaHdzblZ0S2FXdHQ5QlU3SnlWTTJuTkJhWmtabnl2djI3eXc</guid></item><item><title>独家：电子战初创公司CX2获得3100万美元- Axios | Exclusive: Electronic warfare startup CX2 snags $31 million - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5KR2JtcEJCVHFZdlNYVnZJM3IydXdCcGw4NTRJbG4zd1FzZlg1Z050MW5KaXZLck5wLThKRXhrdllXZ01Yd3ZUYTBQMl90R3lJRHZWbGQwcmZDM3Vha08yMU0yRWpqWV9OV0ZhQy1kWTdQWHRNYWRzNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 19:56:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5KR2JtcEJCVHFZdlNYVnZJM3IydXdCcGw4NTRJbG4zd1FzZlg1Z050MW5KaXZLck5wLThKRXhrdllXZ01Yd3ZUYTBQMl90R3lJRHZWbGQwcmZDM3Vha08yMU0yRWpqWV9OV0ZhQy1kWTdQWHRNYWRzNw</guid></item><item><title>威廉姆斯县CASS报告的更多麻疹病例- InForum | More measles cases reported in Cass, Williams counties - InForum</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxORV8zTV9EYkpzZVhjYmstUnB2V2F5V3E1OTNKTzZZNGMwTGg2aGNfLUJJZ0dFUmhhdkI4cy1xYktKWHM5Z3ZXUzhjM1NCUHZBZ1RsWFdhTi1yYnRuWkZTU2JwOG1qVG52eU9Caml1LXhMem1fd001Rm5JT01iLTBrSi1UejhJSllhdXNKYnZpRko0YU1Jc1pPNmt0dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody"&gt;

       in the state — two each in Cass and Williams counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four of the cases are in unvaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Cass County, home to Fargo and West Fargo, has four cases of the disease, and Williams County, home to Williston, has 13. No other counties in the state have reported measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those infected, one person is under 5 years old, 12 are between age 5 and 19, and 4 are 20 or older, according to Health and Human Services data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person in Cass County has been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, viral illness that can be fatal, particularly for young children and those with compromised immune systems. Measles spreads through the air and can remain in a room and on surfaces for up to two hours, sometimes even traveling between floors through ventilation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms often include a fever, cough, runny nose or eye irritation followed by a body-wide rash. There is no specific medical treatment for measles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;According to the state health department, most North Dakotans are vaccinated against measles, and the risk to the general public is low. People who were vaccinated as children and 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/health/some-adults-may-only-have-1-measles-vaccine-dose-others-may-have-no-protection-doctors-say" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;adults born before 1957&lt;/a&gt;
    
       are considered protected due to previous infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after two doses,” Molly Howell, state immunization director, said in a statement. “People who are vaccinated and exposed to measles are not likely to develop the disease. MMR vaccination is critical to preventing the spread of measles in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information about measles, vaccination or local clinic availability, contact the Health and Human Services Immunization Unit at

                Our newsroom occasionally reports stories under a byline of "staff." Often, the "staff" byline is used when rewriting basic news briefs that originate from official sources, such as a city press release about a road closure, and which require little or no reporting. At times, this byline is used when a news story includes numerous authors or when the story is formed by aggregating previously reported news from various sources. If outside sources are used, it is noted within the story.

Ethel Caterham, the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115, offers a simple yet powerful insight into how she has managed to live such a remarkable life.Born in 1909, Ethel has witnessed immense global changes—from world wars to technological revolutions—and through it all, she has maintained a philosophy that has kept her peaceful, healthy, and vibrant. Her secret? One straightforward rule that she believes has helped her live over a century: “Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.” This rule, rooted in calmness and self-respect, reveals much about the connection between emotional well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One rule the 115-year-old world’s oldest woman lives by every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about her secret to living beyond a century, Ethel’s answer was refreshingly simple: avoiding arguments and listening more. She said, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;“Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This philosophy centers on emotional calmness and self-control, avoiding unnecessary conflicts that can drain energy and increase stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research confirms the wisdom in Ethel’s words. Chronic stress and emotional turmoil are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, weakened immune function, and accelerated aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to avoid arguments, Ethel likely protected her body and mind from these harmful effects, creating an environment where health and happiness could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ethel Caterham’s early life and formative experiences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel Caterham was born on August 21, 1909, in the village of Shipton Bellinger, England. Growing up as the second youngest in a family of eight siblings, her early years were shaped by simplicity and traditional values. Life at that time was markedly different — horse-drawn carriages, handwritten letters, and a world on the brink of World War I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the many historical upheavals she experienced, Ethel maintained a steady and calm disposition throughout her life. This ability to remain composed and adaptable was a foundation that supported her health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How emotional well-being impacts longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional health is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in overall longevity. Studies show that people who manage their emotions well and maintain stable, positive relationships tend to live longer and healthier lives. Chronic emotional conflict can lead to inflammation in the body, which is associated with many age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s ability to listen and remain composed reflects an emotional resilience that scientific studies link to longevity. By conserving her energy for positive experiences rather than arguments, she helped her body maintain a healthier internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A life rich with experience and travel&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s long life was also marked by boldness and curiosity. At 18, she traveled to India to work as a nanny, embracing new cultures and challenges. Later, she lived in Hong Kong and Gibraltar with her husband, a British army major. These experiences likely enriched her life and kept her mentally engaged, another important factor linked to healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite frequent moves and changes, Ethel’s calm demeanor never wavered. She raised two daughters in the UK and continued to live with strength and grace, even after the loss of her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;115 years of life, love, and calm: What Ethel teaches us about longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel recently celebrated her 115th birthday surrounded by friends, family, and caregivers. Beyond the impressive number, her story is a reminder that longevity is about quality as much as quantity. Her life teaches us that peace of mind, emotional balance, and simple joy can be the most effective ingredients for a long life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Practical lessons From Ethel Caterham’s rule for long life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we cannot all control our genetics or the eras we live through, Ethel’s simple rule offers actionable wisdom:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid unnecessary conflict&lt;/strong&gt;: Focus on listening and understanding rather than arguing, which can reduce stress and promote emotional health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do what you like&lt;/strong&gt;: Prioritise your happiness and well-being, embracing personal autonomy and enjoyment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay curious&lt;/strong&gt;: Embrace new experiences and cultures to keep your mind active and engaged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice emotional resilience&lt;/strong&gt;: Develop habits that support calmness and mental clarity, such as mindfulness and deep breathing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supporting healthy longevity with modern science&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s philosophy aligns with scientific recommendations for longevity, which emphasize emotional health alongside physical health. Regular exercise, hydration, stress management, a balanced diet, and strong social connections are all essential. Emotional calmness and happiness have been shown to enhance immune function, reduce the risk of chronic disease, and improve overall life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 18:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxOY3UxSmNlWDlzTkZfVGtoUFg2enJSelNtVjN4UlJJaW5GY3hRUEk1S1VxSDRSTXlna3RnbE0wRXVtWFp4RklFUTAzVEg4Mnlfa1g4a04xUVA3UnV2djZpVmlIVXBEa2o5dkxVVGtFLTBmQnpYREFUWWZIQmFSdFpDMUlQc1JrdFpORU01elZuV1lUUGdaNEd6RXdmQ3k2NlkxXy03S25NUDNxTl9aWDhHTWVHRFVHbGFpZkZpVDhFRGZodG9XeWVVQk1lZzhITTd4WTZWaXhOZGtVT2pmTlloRXlyaTRjazVocHpz</guid></item><item><title>肠道细菌可以影响大脑蛋白质如何被碳水化合物修饰- PsyPost | Gut bacteria can influence how brain proteins are modified by carbohydrates - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxQLWZkQ05ZTnAzREdoWHRzUTdGNUxTYTFERHQ5d1ZZUFBZcUJ5WEVoNzFITzUyVkVmcXMtX3NxelVmNTdNdHk5RlRaRHNPb1VLWVR5b3hHY3kxeE9QNE93NWlJX09kbHM1Ukk2aGlIXzV6ZTFwWVZWNmN5Z3dpYVR5dkF4dzc0dDlaRjRUcTJqenpaWGp0bmZEdFJxbVpGa2hyZ3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41594-025-01485-w" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Structural and Molecular Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers groundbreaking evidence that gut bacteria can influence how proteins in the brain are chemically modified by sugars, a process known as glycosylation. Using a new method called DQGlyco, the researchers were able to analyze brain glycosylation with unprecedented resolution, revealing that different microbial populations in the gut can alter these patterns in ways that may affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein glycosylation is a biological process in which sugar molecules are added to proteins, helping regulate how proteins function, interact, and communicate within and between cells. While this process plays important roles in many systems of the body, its involvement in the brain has been difficult to study due to the complexity and diversity of sugar modifications. Past studies have also been limited by technical constraints in identifying and quantifying the many forms of glycosylation that can occur on a single protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome these challenges, researchers developed a method called deep quantitative glycoprofiling, or DQGlyco. This new technique allows scientists to measure protein glycosylation at a scale and resolution not previously possible. The team then used DQGlyco to examine how glycosylation patterns in the mouse brain are affected by different gut microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study began by validating the DQGlyco method in both human cells and mouse brain tissue. This method combines improved sample preparation, high-sensitivity detection, and precise labeling techniques to isolate and analyze glycopeptides—protein fragments with attached sugar chains. The researchers applied their method to brain tissue from mice, identifying over 177,000 unique glycopeptides. This is more than 25 times the number identified in previous studies, offering an unprecedented view of the brain glycoproteome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this enhanced dataset, the researchers discovered widespread “microheterogeneity”—meaning that individual sites on a protein often carried many different sugar forms, known as glycoforms. On average, they found about 17 glycoforms per site, and in some cases, more than 600 different glycoforms at a single location. This variation was not random. Sites with greater microheterogeneity were more likely to be located in structured and accessible parts of the protein, suggesting that structural features help determine how extensively proteins are glycosylated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that certain types of glycosylation—such as those involving specific sugar types like fucose or sialic acid—were more common on particular protein domains, such as those involved in immune signaling or cell adhesion. These findings suggest that the chemical diversity of sugar modifications may be functionally relevant, influencing how proteins interact and perform their roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the influence of the gut microbiome on brain glycosylation, the team conducted experiments using germ-free mice. These mice were either kept sterile or colonized with different bacterial populations, including a single common gut species or a defined community of eight bacteria. Two weeks later, the researchers analyzed the mice’s brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed substantial differences in glycosylation patterns between the groups. Over 2,500 glycopeptides in the brain were affected by the presence or absence of gut microbes. These changes were especially prominent on proteins known to be involved in neurotransmission, such as glutamate receptors and ion channels. Many of the altered glycoforms were located at sites with high microheterogeneity, indicating that microbial signals might be influencing the most dynamically glycosylated regions of brain proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, only a small number of changes in protein abundance were observed, suggesting that the differences were not due to changes in how much protein was produced, but rather in how those proteins were modified after being made. Additional experiments showed that glycosylation changes were also associated with differences in protein solubility and thermal stability, two indicators of changes in protein function or localization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that certain glycoforms were more likely to be surface-exposed on cells, using enzymes to selectively cleave sugars or proteins from intact cells. Surface-exposed glycoforms tended to be more complex and processed, whereas high-mannose forms—often considered immature—were less accessible. This helped distinguish between proteins that were still being processed inside cells versus those functioning at the cell surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining deep profiling with structural predictions from AlphaFold, the researchers created a model that could predict whether a given glycosylation site was likely to be highly variable or not. This model, based on structural exposure and folding, successfully distinguished between high and low microheterogeneity sites and suggested that glycosylation patterns are influenced by the 3D structure of proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings open new directions for understanding the gut-brain axis, the study has several limitations. The experiments were conducted in mice, so it is not yet clear how directly the results apply to humans. The study also measured glycosylation patterns at a specific time point, meaning that the dynamic nature of these changes over longer periods remains unknown. Additionally, although changes in glycosylation were linked to structural and biophysical changes in proteins, the functional consequences for behavior or brain activity were not directly tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may explore how these glycosylation changes influence neural development, cognition, or disease risk. The authors also suggest that their DQGlyco method could be applied to human tissue or disease models to identify glycosylation signatures linked to neurological or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-025-01485-w" target="_blank"&gt;Uncovering protein glycosylation dynamics and heterogeneity using deep quantitative glycoprofiling (DQGlyco)&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Clément M.

				&lt;p&gt;Five travel-associated cases of Legionnaires’ disease are being investigated by the Southern Nevada Health District, the agency announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two are at the South Point, and three others are at the neighboring Grandview at Las Vegas, the agency said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At South Point, one person stayed at the property in August, while the other stayed in February. Both individuals have since recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Grandview, one person stayed at the property in February, while the other two stayed in April. All three were hospitalized; two have since recovered, and one remains hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following notification of cases, the Health District conducted environmental water sampling at the facilities. Multiple water samples tested positive for Legionella, the bacteria that can cause Legionnaires’ disease, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legionnaires’ disease symptoms typically begin within two to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria. However, people should watch for symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches and headaches for up to two weeks after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guests who stayed at the South Point on or after April 16 and who developed or are experiencing symptoms within 14 days of their stay are urged to &lt;a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8326801/South-Point-Legionella-Investigation" target="_blank"&gt;complete a confidential illness survey here&lt;/a&gt;. Guests who stayed at The Grandview on or after March 27 and who developed or are experiencing symptoms within 14 days of their stay are urged to &lt;a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/8323167/Grandview-Legionella-Investigation" target="_blank"&gt;complete a confidential illness survey here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If guests are currently still symptomatic, they should seek medical attention and alert their medical provider of the potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a developing story. Check back for updates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve sat with worried parents. I’ve cared for patients at their most vulnerable. And I’ve always believed that public health decisions, especially those made by government, must be grounded in science, shaped by ethics, and made with the public’s trust in mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m deeply concerned about a new policy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5383172/rfk-jr-placebo-vaccine-testing-studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reportedly under consideration&lt;/a&gt; at the Department of Health and Human Services mandating placebo-controlled trials for all new vaccines — even when proven vaccines for the same disease already exist. That would be a sharp and dangerous break from decades of precedent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On its face, more testing might seem like a step toward greater safety. But this change doesn’t make vaccines safer or science stronger. Instead, it forces researchers to unethically withhold proven protection from some patients, all under the guise of “scientific rigor.” And that’s where it becomes a problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In medicine, if we already have a treatment that works, we don’t ignore it; we use it as the benchmark. That’s how we evaluate new cancer drugs, heart medications, and therapies for nearly every other condition. Vaccines are no different. We build on what works. We don’t pretend it doesn’t exist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Picture enrolling your child in a clinical trial for a next-generation RSV vaccine. You assume it will be tested against the protection already available. But under this policy, your child might receive an inert injection instead — offering no protection at all — not because no preventive option exists, but because federal policy requires scientists to ignore it.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s not good science. It’s a violation of basic medical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The notion that we should require placebo trials even when there’s already a safe, effective vaccine goes against decades of established norms in clinical research. For years, regulators have evaluated new vaccines case by case — sometimes using placebos, sometimes comparing them with existing vaccines — based on what’s ethical and appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2006 and 2020, the overwhelming majority of FDA-approved vaccines followed one of those two paths. That’s not a glitch in the system. It’s how smart, patient-centered science works: by balancing rigor with real-world responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new HHS policy discards that balance. It replaces clinical judgment with rigidity. And in doing so, it risks slowing the development of next-generation vaccines, raising costs, and discouraging innovation, especially for diseases that don’t make headlines but still take lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just as worrying is the message this sends. By implying that previous vaccine trials were insufficient, the policy fuels public skepticism at a time when trust is already fragile. The truth is, vaccines are among the most closely monitored medical products in the world, including in the U.S. — and they continue to be even after approval.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) collects reports from providers and patients across the country. The Vaccine Safety Datalink tracks health outcomes for more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/about/developing-safe-effective-vaccines.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https:**Awww.cdc.gov*vaccines*parents*infographics*journey-of-child-vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;24 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; through a network of major health systems. And PRISM — the Post-Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Monitoring system — uses insurance data from &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mihp/providers/current-mihp-providers/initiatives/immunization-toolkit/general-vaccine-information/vaccine-safety-and-effectiveness?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nearly 200 million people&lt;/a&gt; to identify rare side effects quickly and at scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just this month, VAERS &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/seniors-mosquito-vaccine-warning-ixchiq-20329602.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flagged&lt;/a&gt; rare but serious reactions in older adults who received the new chikungunya vaccine, Ixchiq. The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/medical-product-safety-information/fda-and-cdc-recommend-pause-use-ixchiq-chikungunya-vaccine-live-individuals-60-years-age-and-older" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA and CDC&lt;/a&gt; issued safety alerts advising adults over 60 to avoid the shot while investigations continued. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These systems work. They’ve caught issues early. They’ve shaped dosing guidelines. And they’ve helped build one of the most effective immunization programs in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course we should continue holding all new vaccines to a high standard. That’s not in question. But we need to distinguish between rigor and rigidity. We don’t protect patients by pretending safe vaccines don’t exist. And we don’t build public confidence by rewriting the rules in ways that ignore both ethics and common sense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new HHS policy doesn’t make patients safer. It doesn’t improve science. And it doesn’t reflect the values I carried with me in the hospital or in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can do better. And we should. Lives depend on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Correction: An earlier version of this essay misstated the status of RSV vaccines for children. The essay has also been updated to clarify the status of the policy surrounding placebo-controlled trials for vaccines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, often says that when his uncle was president in the early 1960s, Americans were much healthier than they are now. People were thinner and had lower rates of chronic disease, he recalls. Fewer children had autism, allergies or autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On Thursday, the Trump administration &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/kennedy-trump-maha-report.html" title=""&gt;released a report on children’s health&lt;/a&gt; premised on the idea that we’ve fallen far since this golden era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But were Americans really healthier back then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The U.S. population was much younger in the 1960s, at the tail end of the Baby Boom, which complicates comparisons. Only 12.4 percent of the population was 65 or older in 1963, compared with 17.7 percent now. Rates of chronic diseases generally increase with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Americans must be doing something right: Life expectancy has increased. A child born today can expect to live almost a decade longer than a child born in 1960. That’s partly because advances in medical care mean that conditions that were deadly decades ago can be kept in check for longer now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If R.F.K. Jr. makes the statement that more people are dying of chronic diseases now than in Jack Kennedy’s era, that’s undoubtedly true — we’ve got twice as many people, and a much larger chunk are old folks who have much higher chronic disease rates,” said Kenneth Warner, dean emeritus of the University of Michigan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Does that mean we’re doing worse than back then?” he added. “Absolutely not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Americans have put on the pounds over the decades, as Mr. Kennedy often notes. Diabetes and obesity are on the rise even among adolescents. On the other hand, the country has cut back dramatically on smoking, a habit that once contributed to huge numbers of deaths in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
