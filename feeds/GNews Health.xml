The findings suggest that seeing original art not only moves people emotionally, but also calms the body and promotes health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, led by King’s College London, involved 50 people aged between 18 and 40 in the UK. Half viewed original artwork at the Courtauld Gallery in London, while the other half looked at copies of the same paintings in a non-gallery environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The two groups wore sensors that continually measured their heart rates and skin temperature during the 20-minute session, with saliva samples also taken before and after viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;From these samples, researchers found that levels of the stress hormone cortisol fell by an average of 22% among those viewing original art, compared with just 8% looking at reproductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) linked to stress and a number of chronic diseases fell by 30% and 28% respectively among those in the gallery, with no changes in the other group. This suggests art has a potential calming effect on the body’s inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Tony Woods, a researcher at King’s College London, said: “The research clearly shows the stress-reducing properties of viewing original art and its ability to simultaneously excite, engage and arouse us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Stress hormones and inflammatory markers like cortisol, IL-6 and TNF-alpha are linked to a wide range of health problems, from heart disease and diabetes to anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The fact that viewing original art lowered these markers suggests that cultural experiences may play a real role in protecting both mind and body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study also found that art engages the immune system, the nervous system and the endocrine system, which is responsible for releasing hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers detected signs of excitement among those viewing art in the gallery, including a dip in skin temperature, overall higher heart rates and a variation in heartbeat patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“From a scientific perspective, the most exciting outtake is that art had a positive impact on three different body systems – the immune, endocrine and autonomic systems – at the same time,” Woods said. “This is a unique finding and something we were genuinely surprised to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In short, our unique and original study provides compelling evidence that viewing art in a gallery is good for you and helps to further our understanding of its fundamental benefits. In essence, art doesn’t just move us emotionally – it calms the body too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The emotional intelligence of each person was also assessed before the study using questionnaires but researchers said this had no impact on individual responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jenny Waldman, the director of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Art&lt;/a&gt; Fund, which co-funded the study, said: “This study proves for the first time what we’ve long felt at Art Fund – that art really is good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What’s particularly exciting is that the findings show these benefits are universal – they can be experienced by anyone. We want to encourage everyone to make time to visit their local museum or gallery and experience these powerful effects for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxPbW9kd21IYld5bnRQckZNYWF1UlJYdXJCUFFMQ296QjNfQk11dThfbW5PTFJXSXo4VUtFUEpnY2wyTHJJRzVjbGR6a3FTSllVblJxVlR3dE5sdFFjM3RHWFhIREtzZTh6ejF4T1VTakFxRWlSWXl2clhMb1FFeG9hclRYTmxIdTFSazEwcmRGcGlIWFlWek40NGEwV3BvLS0wT0U4TE1nYUpid1FKZ080SzZMVmZKb3MwNi1POWxZbmV5dw</guid></item><item><title>《华盛顿邮报》如何发现美国玉米带中年轻癌症的发病率不断上升</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/27/iowa-cancer-analysis-methodology/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="topper-text-elems" class="wpds-c-kebnqj wpds-c-kebnqj-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-topper" class="wpds-c-cBzrLX wpds-c-cBzrLX-cmVlgk-isCenterNS-false wpds-c-cBzrLX-iyHTpF-useUATStyles-true wpds-c-cBzrLX-ieuxqEo-css"&gt;&lt;h1 id="main-content" data-qa="headline" data-testid="headline" class="wpds-c-eRlesA wpds-c-eRlesA-dHdMuz-isOnSplitTopper-false wpds-c-eRlesA-bAbYzz-isStyle-false wpds-c-eRlesA-iPJLV-css"&gt;How The Post found growing rates of young cancer in America’s Corn Belt&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p data-qa="subheadline" data-testid="subheadline" class="wpds-c-ckOSsQ wpds-c-ckOSsQ-iPJLV-css"&gt;In looking into shifting cancer rates, a Washington Post data analysis revealed a divergence: among young adults in the Corn Belt — Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Minnesota, Indiana and Kansas — cancer diagnoses are rising more rapidly than in the country as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-testid="timestamp" class="wpds-c-bEimne wpds-c-bEimne-dyECYW-theme-default"&gt;&lt;time datetime="2025-10-27T18:30:04.280Z" class="wpds-c-gRBhEF wpds-c-gRBhEF-idbzzBd-css overrideStyles"&gt;&lt;span class="overrideStyles"&gt;Updated &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-eUMOSL"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="published-date" class="wpds-c-bASIGw wpds-c-bASIGw-ilmVsQY-css overrideStyles"&gt;October 27, 2025 at 2:30 p.m. EDT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="relative-date" class="wpds-c-bASIGw wpds-c-bASIGw-idUCtvg-css overrideStyles"&gt;today at 2:30 p.m. EDT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 22:32:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOZWpYcGZiZlowdXRISkJzNE5YeHZlSGJWbXJwY2lSMThacmFCUzBoT01CTjZ5S3g2VGxNMGFpMm1nRTRCUzU1YnYtNGlDcUN0QThFQWhiUExxUDhBUm5SckZTeWlZd0VyNGRXRGdnWmJQaUYwMnR3SDBkMXRnalUzRmNzRHpLNVVWVGc</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，在步行促进健康方面，时间越长越好- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/comes-walking-health-longer-better-study-suggests-rcna240095</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b12f43" class="body-graf"&gt;Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-747e5a" class="body-graf"&gt;In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-01547" target="_blank"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f4cb08" class="body-graf"&gt;What’s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a97c92" class="body-graf"&gt;An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk" target="_blank"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-722564" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group — 42.9% of participants — fell into the under-five-minute category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ec362" class="body-graf"&gt;After about 9½ years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6637b5" class="body-graf"&gt;People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2466a2" class="body-graf"&gt;Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations “doses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23f08b" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a clear dose response,” del Pozo Cruz said. “The longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-093367" class="body-graf"&gt;The decision to study people’s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/daily-steps-to-lower-risk-of-death-rcna98754" target="_blank"&gt;total number of steps&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/workout-exercise-commitment-personality-study-rcna217288" target="_blank"&gt;intensity of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, was intentional, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-13fed6" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,” del Pozo Cruz said. “Everyone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-49b86f" class="body-heading"&gt;Forget ‘exercise snacks’ and 10,000 steps a day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eebd68" class="body-graf"&gt;The notion that adults should strive for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/how-many-steps-day-should-you-take-study-finds-7-n1278853" target="_blank"&gt;10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt; is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, an associate professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&amp;amp;M University, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fba993" class="body-graf"&gt;Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode — changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn’t see as strong health gains, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f84d52" class="body-graf"&gt;“You need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that’s where the health benefits come from,” Riechman said. “The one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8c6728" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;mixed research&lt;/a&gt; on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be “suboptimally active.” All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-483b36" class="body-graf"&gt;The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f92be6" class="body-graf"&gt;“You have big returns from zero to something,” Riechman said. “Then you keep getting benefits, but they’re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you’re not accumulating too many more benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0a5060" class="body-graf"&gt;The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/exercise-snacks-short-activity-bursts-heart-health-muscle-strength-rcna236192" target="_blank"&gt;“exercise snacks,”&lt;/a&gt; or spurts of physical activity lasting less than &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/lower-blood-pressure-5-minute-exercise-rcna178928" target="_blank"&gt;five minutes&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/09/26/bjsports-2025-110027" target="_blank"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz’s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c5fd0" class="body-graf"&gt;“Every step counts,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/walking/every-step-counts" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association, &lt;/a&gt;a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4f8e74" class="body-graf"&gt;“Getting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there’s definitely a benefit,” he said. “To me, you’re just not optimizing the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-e38670" class="body-heading"&gt;‘Never too late’ to start walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b4b7d" class="body-graf"&gt;The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dadf32" class="body-graf"&gt;Another research constraint is that participants’ walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people’s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study’s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn’t involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9d8adb" class="body-graf"&gt;One of the study’s biggest strengths, she said, is participants’ average age: 62. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/aging/superaging-memory-social-aging-northwestern-university-study-over-80-rcna222908" target="_blank"&gt;a time of life&lt;/a&gt; when people may assume they’re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2be093" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can start [walking] at any age; it’s not too late,” Swain said. “The physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-20f8d7" class="body-graf"&gt;Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it’s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-61ee15" class="body-graf"&gt;“Unfortunately, it’s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven’t done it for so long,” said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. “There has to be motivation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ab1974" class="body-graf"&gt;With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-330ea1" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Walking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,” she said. “It’s a good form of exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 21:06:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOUFBuQ0Y1S1FfbV8xTE9MTFY4OHBtUm5ldWNDRmkxdVlmaVVwbkpLT2NnNGYtcDVGb0k0cXdfWXlERmgtNW9PX3Bxc0tsb1RXZTRrazlSRmh2NDg3cGsyYzQ3bl9neE8yV2RMMEl2ODNxUEd4c2lZNWpaZ292aWJsd3daZ1V5WjZYR2pIcjFOV2V2UlBpdHBaUkJFcjVpcDNfckRld2RB0gFWQVVfeXFMTng2QUtfR1BGY2NhdW81dHlUUXRVbGFrRDBwTlhFend4ZVNJUVpHSllIeW5UaTRFY1NhMXJvVlpaX1NsWGlFdENrQTI2SE9wcGt1Qldfb0E</guid></item><item><title>瘦子是新的脂肪：研究发现，很多人的体重指数“正常” ，但隐性肥胖- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/skinny-is-the-new-fat-plenty-of-people-have-normal-bmi-but-hidden-obesity-study-finds-2000677510</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Your number on the bathroom scale could be misleading. New research finds that a substantial portion of people with “normal” weight still have obesity—and the higher risk of other health problems that goes along with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large, international team of scientists examined survey data from the World Health Organization. They found that roughly one in five people worldwide with a healthy body mass index (BMI) show clear signs of abdominal obesity, or excess body fat. These skinny-fat individuals were also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure. Doctors could be missing important health issues if they only focus on their patients’ BMI, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Relying solely on BMI may be insufficient to identify these high-risk individuals and provide timely interventions,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840296"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;“Normal” but obese&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;BMI is calculated using a person’s weight and height, with obesity traditionally defined as having a BMI of 30 and over. In recent years, however, some doctors and patients have pushed for an expansion of what should be considered obese.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In January, a large group of obesity experts, backed by organizations like the American Heart Association, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/say-bye-to-just-bmi-experts-call-for-a-major-shift-in-how-we-measure-obesity-2000549992"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; alternative criteria for diagnosing obesity. This criterion asks doctors to either use BMI alongside one other measurement of excess body fat or to rely on these other measurements entirely. One such measurement is waist circumference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this new study, the researchers analyzed data from the WHO STEPS survey, a long-running project &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/tools-and-toolkits/who-stepwise-approach-to-surveillance"&gt;monitored&lt;/a&gt; by the WHO that allows countries to keep track of their residents’ risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, particularly those related to their lifestyle. In total, they looked at nearly a half million participants across 91 countries between 2000 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, 21% of respondents met the threshold for “normal-weight abdominal obesity,” meaning they had a healthy BMI but a large enough waistline to be categorized as obese. Compared to people with a normal BMI and healthy waistline, this group also had a higher prevalence of hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Not just BMI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other recent research has highlighted the importance of moving past BMI alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study earlier this month, for instance, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-staggering-number-of-americans-are-now-considered-obese-under-new-definition-2000673086"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that nearly 70% of Americans today meet the newer definition of obesity; this included 25% of Americans who had a normal BMI but other measures of excess body fat, such as waist circumference. This study also found that people with skinny obesity had a higher overall risk of health problems than nonobese people. That said, the authors of the latest study say theirs is the first to examine how common this form of hidden obesity is across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than wholly abandon BMI altogether, the study researchers argue that doctors should use it in combination with these other measurements to truly get a better sense of their patients’ overall cardiovascular and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest the need to use both BMI and waist circumference together, rather than in isolation, to provide a more complete and accurate assessment of cardiometabolic risk across diverse populations,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These results should also motivate the average person to get a thorough checkup at their next physical, one that doesn’t just stop at BMI.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), the German government agency responsible for monitoring animal pestilence, there have been 30 registered outbreaks in poultry batteries and another 73 among wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"And we're expecting more," a spokesperson told the dpa news agency, explaining that another 23 suspected cases are currently being investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the FLI, outbreaks of bird flu usually emerge at the start of November at the height of the migratory season, meaning that the current pestilence could yet to reach its peak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the south-western state of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/rhineland-palatinate/t-18967902"&gt;Rhineland-Palatinate&lt;/a&gt;, local authorities said new suspected cases were reaching them on a daily basis and spoke of an "unusual dynamic."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bird flu in Germany: where are the most affected areas?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst affected areas are the northern and eastern states of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/lower-saxony/t-18967666"&gt;Lower Saxony&lt;/a&gt; (20 cases), &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/thuringia/t-18968071"&gt;Thuringia&lt;/a&gt; (19), &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/brandenburg/t-18968125"&gt;Brandenburg&lt;/a&gt; (19) and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/mecklenburg-western-pomerania/t-18968236"&gt;Mecklenburg-West Pomerania&lt;/a&gt; (14). But cases have also been confirmed in the southern state of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/bavaria/t-18968282"&gt;Bavaria&lt;/a&gt; (eight) and the western state of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/north-rhine-westphalia/t-18943637"&gt;North Rhine-Westphalia&lt;/a&gt; (five).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cranes have reportedly been particularly badly affected, with emergency services in northern Brandenburg, just north of &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/berlin/t-18967759"&gt;Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, having to dispose of thousands of infected, dead animals left strewn across fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the FLI, the outbreaks are being caused by the highly infectious H5N-1 strain of the HPAIV influenza virus – commonly known as bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is bird flu dangerous for humans?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high doses, the virus is theoretically transmissible to humans, but the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/robert-koch-institute-rki/t-70901522"&gt;Robert Koch Institute (RKI)&lt;/a&gt;, Germany's federal agency for disease control and prevention, isn't aware of any such cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, the effect on humans could be more likely to be felt in the pocket, with Bavarian Poultry Union chairman Robert Schmack warning of a potential 40% increase in the price of eggs and a smaller choice of poultry products in supermarkets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The president of the Central German Poultry Union, Hans-Peter Goldknick, however, disagrees, telling public broadcaster &lt;em&gt;ZDF &lt;/em&gt;that he is "not expecting price explosions in the short term," nor in the build-up to Christmas, not least because most geese in Germany are imported from Hungary and Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help prevent the spread of the virus, the FLI recommends avoiding contact with dead birds and not wearing dirty boots near pens holding vulnerable animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in the German parliament, the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/bundestag-germanys-lower-house-of-parliament/t-19153330"&gt;Bundestag&lt;/a&gt;, a spokeswoman for the opposition &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/germanys-green-party/t-17365878"&gt;Green Party&lt;/a&gt; said that the current outbreak of bird flu had revealed the "vulnerability of factory farming," where packed pens provide optimal conditions for the virus to spread.&lt;/p&gt;

But about 30 minutes after the woman closed her eyes, Scott saw the telltale signs of sleep from the electroencephalogram, or EEG: a shift to lower-frequency brainwaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The woman progressed into deep sleep, and “was there for quite a while”, Scott said. Then, the woman suddenly woke up, saying she had to go to the bathroom. As Scott detached her from the machines, the participant apologized, saying she felt terrible she hadn’t been able to fall asleep yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She was absolutely adamant that she hadn’t slept,” Scott said, who had just watched her sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When a person is sleeping, but doesn’t know they are, this is called sleep state misperception. If woken up, a person will say they were awake the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s a frequent issue in insomnia, said Matthew Reid, a neuroscientist and sleep researcher at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. An insomniac may say they have barely slept, but when tested in a sleep lab, they might actually be sleeping a normal number of hours per night. This leads to a conundrum: how does someone feel rested when they are sleeping enough – but just not realizing it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This experience, which afflicts a significant number of insomniacs, has had various names: paradoxical insomnia, subjective insomnia, sleep state misperception and, most recently, subjective-objective sleep discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By any name, the phenomenon reveals that we don’t always know when we’re asleep or awake, and that our beliefs about sleep influence how rested we feel. At the same time, researchers are finding that people with paradoxical insomnia may not be entirely wrong; there may be something real that lies between sleeping and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-paradoxical-insomnia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is paradoxical insomnia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Paradoxical insomnia is a subcategory of insomnia. People with it report that they only sleep a few hours a night and don’t feel rested. But sleep studies show they are getting more sleep than that – sometimes even a typical amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;People with insomnia seem to suffer from straightforward problems: trouble falling asleep, staying asleep and getting enough sleep to feel rested. Their sleep issues make them tired during the day; they have difficulty concentrating, and feel irritable and grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But total sleep time &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213000452" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;doesn’t always differ by much&lt;/a&gt; between healthy sleepers and people with insomnia. On average, according to one meta-analysis, insomniacs sleep just &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.13802#:~:text=A%20meta%2Danalysis%20of%20such,.%2C%202010%2C%202017)." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;23 minutes&lt;/a&gt; less per night than healthy sleepers. If time asleep isn’t the whole story, what is?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Of course, some people need more sleep than others. But it turns out some people don’t perceive their sleep accurately. They do not seem to remember that they did sleep. They may sleep a full night, but not feel rested. These studies revealed that insomnia can be a more complex experience than it appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"19b1fb7e-e13b-4e36-b997-9f6ddd304184","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="19b1fb7e-e13b-4e36-b997-9f6ddd304184" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1959, French doctors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079225000498" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;first described&lt;/a&gt; a patient whose observed sleep time didn’t match up with how many hours she thought she slept. The doctors named the condition &lt;em&gt;fausse insomnie&lt;/em&gt; or false insomnia, and believed it was caused by her being overly worried about sleep. Since then, many sleep doctors and researchers have noticed that insomniacs’ sleep complaints don’t always align with the amount of sleep they are observed to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers don’t have a unified estimate of exactly how prevalent paradoxical insomnia is because it has multiple names. But it’s far from rare, Reid said. By &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/597772918.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;some accounts&lt;/a&gt;, about half of people with insomnia sleep less than six hours a night, while the other half sleep more than six hours, an amount comparable to good sleepers’ sleep time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="who-experiences-paradoxical-insomnia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who experiences paradoxical insomnia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many people – even good sleepers – may think they’re still awake in the early stages of sleep. But people with paradoxical insomnia are more likely to think they’re awake after the first two hours. They are also more likely to report feeling awake during REM sleep, when almost all good sleepers will report accurately that they were sleeping. In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34710350/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;serial awakening&lt;/a&gt; studies, people with insomnia who are woken up multiple times throughout the night will report being awake when they had actually been asleep more often than good sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thomas Andrillon, a cognitive neuroscientist at the Paris Brain Institute, has a hunch that awareness during sleep is more nuanced than previously believed. In experiments about &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2016/1/niw014/2757134" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;memory and learning during sleep&lt;/a&gt;, he would see someone sleep, confirmed by their brain activity in real time. Afterwards, they would insist they hadn’t slept. Andrillon realized he had experienced this himself, and that plenty of others did, too – such as his students, who would fall asleep in class, but have no idea they had drifted off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most people have gone through this, even if they’re not insomniacs. For instance, when I’m trying to sleep before an early morning flight, I usually feel like I haven’t even slept an hour. Yet I can recall a dream about, say, sleeping through my alarm, which tells me otherwise. I’ve sat next to a family member on an overnight flight who peacefully passes out, only to arrive at our destination and complain they didn’t sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But brain imaging done by Andrillon and his colleagues is suggesting that insomniacs with discrepancies between their sleep and wake times might not be entirely wrong. Instead, they might be noticing a unique altered state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep researchers determine someone is sleeping when they lose awareness of the world around them, and when their brain activity shifts to high-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations. EEG readouts will feature sleep signatures like slow waves and sleep spindles, or specific &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31804897" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bursts&lt;/a&gt; in activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But commonly used observational techniques might miss the nuances of brain activity during the transition into sleep, or the moments between sleep stages, Andrillon said. The technology might not be sensitive enough to capture “wake-like” brain activity that could explain the feeling of being awake while sleeping. Andrillon said that when other researchers have studied deeper areas of the brain, they found &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811924002799" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;signs of arousal&lt;/a&gt;, even when people seemed asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The fact that they look like they’re sleeping is true only at a superficial level,” Andrillon said. “When you dive a bit more in the details of the brain activity, you see signs of wakefulness that you will typically not see during normal or standard sleep.” Experts are now shifting to the term subjective-objective sleep discrepancy, or SOSD, rather than paradoxical insomnia or sleep state misperception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-07794-6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; from March, in a group of more than 800 people with insomnia, 24% had subjective-objective sleep discrepancies. Andrillon and his colleagues found differences in the physiological profile between the two kinds of insomniacs. People with SOSD didn’t wake up very often, but when they did, their waking state was tainted with signatures of sleep, which could influence their judgment about not sleeping well or not having slept, he said. Conversely, the sleep of insomniacs without SOSD had wake-like features, meaning their sleep was of a lesser quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="are-there-solutions-for-paradoxical-insomnia" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there solutions for paradoxical insomnia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/23/cbt-i-sleep-therapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBT-I&lt;/a&gt;, or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is a well-researched and effective way to improve sleeping habits. It seems to help people with SOSD, too. In a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jsr.14142" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from last year, Scott and colleagues found CBT-I had no difference in positive outcomes for people with regular insomnia, compared with those who had SOSD. Other studies have shown that CBT-I &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29402512/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31422853/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;improve issues related to&lt;/a&gt; SOSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It won’t be useful to become overly worried about whether you’re getting the perfect amount of sleep, Scott said. There is an association between SOSD and anxious or worried thoughts about sleep, so try not to pile on additional worries. “People who have [SOSD] tend to have certain thoughts, very often involving rumination about worries of the day, worries of not sleeping, not being able to sleep,” Andrillon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, a helpful tool for paradoxical insomnia could be a strategy called paradoxical intention, which encourages poor sleepers to stop trying so hard to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Previously, people who could not tell they were asleep were perceived to have flawed judgment. Actually, SOSD is a reminder that we don’t know everything about what it means to be asleep, and to know that we have slept. “We’re going back to it and seeing that it’s actually pretty real,” Andrillon said. “We have just been overlooking this aspect of sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 18:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQSkx6UmtfSUlyRFNNSjdvVGRtdy0zVjEwWklsdnNCV1ZBVUFtZGhJMGVuNUpoZl83a2VTM2t1aDgzMGRUNVhleTF1RFd2ZGI0M0NmMlpILXJZS0NydEdVY2tRWld6RWloS3Y4QVV3bDhEWkhVMmdIVmxGMlptZlNyNg</guid></item><item><title>一名男子说，当他的嘴唇开始肿胀时，他正在吃玉米饼。然后他意识到他对“完全正常的成分”过敏- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/man-says-eating-tacos-lips-171500092.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of tacos&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man said on Reddit that after years of thinking he was a "wimp" with spicy food, he recently learned he actually has an allergy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big plot twist" happened when he slathered on the salsa verde at a recent family BBQ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he thought it was normal for his lips to swell up like that, his family quickly realized something else was going on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, a man said he believed he had “zero” tolerance for spicy foods. However, he recently learned he was just allergic to a "totally normal ingredient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1nyh9e7/tifu_by_realizing_im_not_a_wimp_just_allergic_and/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, the 29-year-old man said he had long believed that he was a “lightweight” when it came to spicy foods. Salsa verde, he noted, was his biggest adversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every single time I ate it, my lips would get a little puffy and tingly,’ the Redditor explained. “It wasn't like, scary swollen, but it was noticeable. I just thought, ‘Okay, cool. This is what a 'mild' spice feels like for a wimp like me.’ It was my normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big plot twist happened last Sunday at a family BBQ. We're all eating tacos, and I slather on the salsa verde," the man continued. "Within a few minutes, I feel the familiar puff-up starting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when he told his sister, "Whoa, this green salsa has a real kick today. My lip is already getting fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, he said his sister replied, "Dude, that's not a 'kick.' Your lip is actually swelling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he said she pointed out that there actually weren't even any chiles in the salsa, it was just tomatillo and onion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, something clicked in their mom’s brain. "Mijo," she said, according to her son, "That's not spice! You're allergic!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redditor said “it finally clicked” for him, too. “Turns out, my body was just having a low-key allergic meltdown to a totally normal ingredient,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before learning about his allergy, the Redditor said he occasionally would treat his tingly face with Benadryl if the sensation “felt a bit more intense than usual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the Redditor realized he was “casually treating my allergic reactions” without knowing he was actually allergic to one of the ingredients he was consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've got an appointment to figure out what exactly hates me, but for now, the jokes at my expense are absolutely relentless,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Redditors revealed they went through similar experiences before learning they were allergic to certain foods, with many writing that it took them years to realize they were experiencing allergies to some of their favorite foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were simply thankful to hear the man was able to avoid a serious allergic reaction before fully understanding his allergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was a bit worried you'd found out you're actually allergic after you had had a serious reaction and had to go to a hospital,” one social media user wrote. “Glad you've figured it out before it was an emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And ultimately, the Redditor was urged to proceed with caution. “Allergies are very much a f--- around and find out kind of thing, you can never stop being careful,” added another commenter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mans-lips-started-swelling-up-realized-allergic-totally-normal-ingredient-11826826" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:24:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9UUXZ1WXE4VGYwSVJ5aUluR3pHSXowX05saTd1VC1ra1NXemtyOEc2T08xYjRoMlhWR2ptZ19aeFVwd2R5NmkyeHN3emlhaDAySjlQSlJhc3F2N29FUTRzZ3huM2p5QVdQM2UtaUdDUFhSQ1lqT0tkNXZn</guid></item><item><title>诊断有多重要？ |治疗师在--《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/mental-health/does-your-mental-health-diagnosis-matter-the-therapist-is-in/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQUDBObE14bEJUd0h5MmF1WkthU1lpWVduOEZzX2w1d0RzWW56ZEwxN052VEl0bVpPZ044N2owUzdwTHNNZXNqbDBybG9VaGloUTBHeXcyTjJ3bEVnQ3o3dUU3SzhnbUxqTEE5REl5SVFuMnA5M2YxZ29HeVdSOGxVWFpWN0dkcjd5ZHBHel85RkVYbkV1eVlxNGJLSHVRVlVqOXRfT19FS0JCdEJKTmFWaHNzbkVUYUpQ?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;How much does a diagnosis matter? | The therapist is in&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQUDBObE14bEJUd0h5MmF1WkthU1lpWVduOEZzX2w1d0RzWW56ZEwxN052VEl0bVpPZ044N2owUzdwTHNNZXNqbDBybG9VaGloUTBHeXcyTjJ3bEVnQ3o3dUU3SzhnbUxqTEE5REl5SVFuMnA5M2YxZ29HeVdSOGxVWFpWN0dkcjd5ZHBHel85RkVYbkV1eVlxNGJLSHVRVlVqOXRfT19FS0JCdEJKTmFWaHNzbkVUYUpQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，这种严重的肠道疾病在年轻的美国人中神秘地上升- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/this-serious-gut-condition-is-mysteriously-rising-in-younger-americans-study-finds-2000677475</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A painful and serious gut problem is increasingly afflicting younger Americans, and no one’s sure why. Recent research shows that cases of severe diverticulitis among people under the age of 50 have substantially risen over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, and others examined data from millions of Americans hospitalized by diverticulitis. They found that the proportion of severe, or complicated, diverticulitis cases in younger Americans noticeably increased between 2005 and 2020. The reasons for this surge are unclear, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Additional research is needed to determine the cause of these trends and identify public health policies aimed at potentially preventing the increasing burden of diverticulitis among younger populations,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Diseases of the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A problematic pouch&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The outer wall of our large intestine can develop a pocket- or pouch-like structure alongside it, formally known as a diverticulum (diverticula for plural). These pouches are harmless on their own, and most people will never be bothered by them. But the pouches can become inflamed and/or infected: a condition we call &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10352-diverticulitis"&gt;diverticulitis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Most cases of diverticulitis are uncomplicated, meaning the inflammation is localized. Though painful, this form can usually be managed with rest, a change in diet, and occasionally antibiotics. Complicated cases are caused by more widespread inflammation, which can then lead to severe, potentially life-threatening issues like gastrointestinal bleeding, abscesses, and even a ruptured colon. It’s these cases that often require hospitalization and sometimes radical interventions like the surgical removal of some or all of a person’s colon (a colectomy).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases of diverticulitis, both mild and severe, are much more common in people over 50. But this latest research suggests that things are changing, and not for the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A worrying trend with no clear answer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the country’s largest publicly available database of hospital visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 2005 and 2020, they found, at least five million Americans were hospitalized for their diverticulitis. About 16% of these cases were early-onset, occurring in people under 50. Over time, the researchers found, more of these early-onset cases led to severe illness. During the study period, the percentage of severe diverticulitis among early-onset cases significantly increased, from 18.5% to 28.2%.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On the positive side, people with early-onset diverticulitis were less likely to die from their condition than older cases and had shorter hospital stays on average. The proportion of early-onset cases treated with colectomy also declined over time (from 35% to 20%), suggesting that doctors have gotten better at managing the condition with less intrusive measures. But younger people were also more likely to require surgery or other invasive treatments for their condition than older patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, the researchers say, there’s no easy explanation for why these cases are becoming more common in younger Americans. It is possible that some of the same risk factors linked to increased early-onset cases of colorectal cancers, such as obesity, may also be driving an increase in diverticulitis. Other lifestyle factors, such as a diet high in fiber, are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6731157/"&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; to lower people’s risk of diverticulitis, and most Americans simply aren’t getting &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/"&gt;enough fiber&lt;/a&gt; in general. Younger people also seem to be &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0316051"&gt;exercising less&lt;/a&gt; than earlier generations, and physical activity is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrgastro.2009.94"&gt;another protective factor&lt;/a&gt; against diverticulitis.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Without more study, though, we can’t know for sure just how much these and other factors could be playing a role in early-onset diverticulitis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Little is known about why we’re seeing this increase in younger patients,” said lead author Shineui Kim, a researcher at UCLA Health, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-analysis-alarming-severe-diverticulitis-younger.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “We urgently need additional research to determine what’s driving these trends, whether it’s dietary factors, lifestyle changes, obesity rates or other environmental influences.”&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

In contrast, men needed to reach 530 minutes, or nearly nine hours, a week to see the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study builds on previous work that suggests women benefit more than men from the same amount of exercise, but that women are generally less physically active and less likely to meet recommended exercise targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Under &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, men and women aged 16 to 64 should take at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, each week, combined with muscle-strengthening activities at least twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the latest work stresses the need for tailored advice for men and women, and highlights the substantial health benefits women can achieve with only moderate amounts of exercise. Globally, one in three women die of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Compared with male individuals, females derive equivalent health benefits with only half the exercise time,” the authors write in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00732-z" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Cardiovascular Research&lt;/a&gt;. “The findings might have potential to encourage females to engage in physical activity,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Jiajin Chen at Xiamen University in China and his colleagues analysed data from activity trackers worn by middle-aged volunteers enrolled in the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/nov/30/uk-biobank-and-the-masses-of-medical-data-that-became-key-to-genetic-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;UK Biobank project&lt;/a&gt;. They first looked at 80,243 participants who did not have coronary heart disease. In this group, women who met the 150-minute weekly exercise target had a 22% lower risk of developing heart disease over eight years of follow-up, compared with those who did not. For men, the risk was 17% lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Further analysis showed that women could reduce their heart disease risk by 30% through exercising for 250 minutes a week, a benefit men only achieved on reaching 530 minutes of physical activity each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most striking result emerged from data on more than 5,000 men and women who already had coronary heart disease. Here, the researchers found that the risk of dying during the follow-up period was three times lower for women who met the weekly exercise target than for similarly active men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e5608e87-b2f8-4e1c-ada5-c1d13b3f617c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"New AI tool can predict a person’s risk of more than 1,000 diseases, say experts","elementId":"e5608e87-b2f8-4e1c-ada5-c1d13b3f617c","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/17/new-ai-tool-can-predict-a-persons-risk-of-more-than-1000-diseases-say-experts"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Yan Wang, a senior author on the paper, said the work showed both sexes could gain “substantial cardiovascular benefits” from physical activity and recommended everyone, regardless of their sex, to take regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But he added that, globally, more women than men were not meeting physical activity targets. “We particularly hope that our findings could encourage physically inactive females to become more active, thereby reducing their cardiovascular risk,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is unclear why exercise may benefit women more than men, but scientists point to differences in sex hormones, muscle fibres and the ability to break down sugar to produce energy as potential factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00734-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying article&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Emily Lau, a women’s cardiovascular health specialist at Massachusetts General hospital, writes: “This study provides further evidence that one size really does not fit all and challenges us to move from conversation to action.

&lt;p&gt;Under local anesthesia, a woman in England was able to play her clarinet for the first time in 5 years whilst receiving treatment for Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deep-brain stimulation (DBS) procedure promised, if successful, to restore motor control in the patient’s hands such that she would be able to play her beloved instrument again, and the surgeon asked her to bring it with her to test the theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting video makes for quite the sight, as the surgery team behind the plastic sanitary screen sat listening in wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;65-year-old Denise Bacon from Crowborough, in the English county of East Sussex, was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2014, and she gradually lost the ability to do her favorite things such as swim, dance, and play the clarinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DBS is a surgical procedure that delivers an electrical current to electrodes implanted in the brain, and is suitable for some patients with disorders such as Parkinson’s. Her skull and scalp were numbed with anesthesia, but she stayed during the four hour intervention, which is when she was asked to play the clarinet to see if her motor control had improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SIMILAR STORY: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I remember my right hand being able to move with much more ease once the stimulation was applied, and this in turn improved my ability to play the clarinet, which I was delighted with,” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq83k7l7jyyo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;she told the BBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m already experiencing improvements in my ability to walk, and I’m keen to get back in the swimming pool, and on the dance floor to see if my abilities have improved there.”&lt;/p&gt;

Yet there is very little research in this area,” said co-senior author Jessica Cohen, PhD, professor of health economics. “Our study highlights the pressing need to improve stillbirth risk prediction and prevention.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study will be published Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in &amp;lt;a title=\"Stillbirths in the United States\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.17392?guestAccessKey=aa38b552-5cc4-4821-acbb-0c42c7b98fbf&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=102725\" target=\"_blank\"&amp;gt;JAMA&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. According to the researchers, it’s one of the largest, most data-rich studies of stillbirth burden to date.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The researchers studied the outcomes of more than 2.7 million pregnancies across the U.S. between 2016 and 2022 using commercial health insurance claims and demographic data from the Health Care Cost Institute, the American Community Survey, and the March of Dimes. Among these pregnancies, 18,893 stillbirths were identified. The researchers examined associations between these stillbirths and a variety of clinical factors, including gestational age at delivery; pregnancy risks such as obesity, pregnancy-related and chronic hypertension, gestational and pre-pregnancy diabetes, and substance use; fetal risks, such as decreased movement, growth restriction, and anomalies; and obstetric risks, such as history of stillbirth or adverse pregnancy outcomes and low or excess amniotic fluid levels. They also considered a variety of socioeconomic factors, including rurality and area-level measures of income, race, and access to obstetric care.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study found that more than 1 in 150 births end in stillbirth—a rate higher than the rate of 1 in 175 births that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published as the national average. The rate was even higher for families living in low-income areas, where 1 in every 112 births ended in stillbirth. The researchers also observed that the stillbirth rate was 1 in every 95 births in areas with higher proportions of Black families compared to White families. Stillbirth rates did not significantly vary according to rurality and levels of access to obstetric care.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The study also found that while 72.3% of stillbirths had at least one clinical risk factor, a sizable portion of stillbirths occurred with no identified clinical risk factor. Across all of the stillbirths in the study, nearly 27.7% had no risk factor. Later gestational ages showed the highest rates of having no clinical risk factor: Among stillbirths that occurred at 38 weeks gestation, 24.1% had no risk factor; at 39 weeks, 34.2%; and at 40+ weeks, 40.7%. Stillbirth rates were highest among pregnancies with low amniotic fluid levels, fetal anomalies, and chronic hypertension.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“Although momentum toward improving stillbirth research and prevention efforts has increased in recent years, rates in the U.S. remain much higher than in peer countries,” said co-senior author &amp;lt;a href=\"https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20660/mark-clapp\" target=\"_blank\"&amp;gt;Mark Clapp, MD, MPH&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, maternal-fetal medicine provider in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at &amp;lt;a href=\"https://www.massgeneral.org/\" target=\"_blank\"&amp;gt;Massachusetts General Hospital&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. “I hope this study will inform policy, practice changes, and future research to ensure no person or family has to experience this outcome.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The researchers also noted that the study’s findings indicate the need for further research into what’s driving socioeconomic variances of stillbirth rates—whether that be social factors, health systems factors, and/or clinical risk factors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Haley Sullivan, student in the Harvard PhD Program in Health Policy, was the study’s first author.

 &lt;h2&gt;Key points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stillbirth burden in the U.S. is higher than previously reported, with over 1 in 150 births ending in stillbirth. The rate is even higher—1 in 112—in low-income areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 70% of stillbirths occurred in pregnancies with at least one identified clinical risk factor (e.g. chronic hypertension), but a substantial share—especially those occurring at 40+ weeks gestation—had none.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;According to the researchers, the findings point to a need to improve stillbirth prevention among pregnancies with identified risk factors as well as improve stillbirth risk prediction, especially later in pregnancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stillbirths occur at a higher rate in the U.S. than previously reported, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and &lt;a href="/en"&gt;Mass General Brigham&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that while most stillbirths had at least one identified clinical risk factor, a substantial share had none, particularly those occurring at 40+ weeks gestation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Stillbirths impact nearly 21,000 families each year in the U.S., and nearly half of those occurring at 37+ weeks are thought to be preventable. Yet there is very little research in this area,” said co-senior author Jessica Cohen, PhD, professor of health economics. “Our study highlights the pressing need to improve stillbirth risk prediction and prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study will be published Monday, Oct. 27, 2025, in &lt;a title="Stillbirths in the United States" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.17392?guestAccessKey=aa38b552-5cc4-4821-acbb-0c42c7b98fbf&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=102725" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;. According to the researchers, it’s one of the largest, most data-rich studies of stillbirth burden to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied the outcomes of more than 2.7 million pregnancies across the U.S. between 2016 and 2022 using commercial health insurance claims and demographic data from the Health Care Cost Institute, the American Community Survey, and the March of Dimes. Among these pregnancies, 18,893 stillbirths were identified. The researchers examined associations between these stillbirths and a variety of clinical factors, including gestational age at delivery; pregnancy risks such as obesity, pregnancy-related and chronic hypertension, gestational and pre-pregnancy diabetes, and substance use; fetal risks, such as decreased movement, growth restriction, and anomalies; and obstetric risks, such as history of stillbirth or adverse pregnancy outcomes and low or excess amniotic fluid levels. They also considered a variety of socioeconomic factors, including rurality and area-level measures of income, race, and access to obstetric care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that more than 1 in 150 births end in stillbirth—a rate higher than the rate of 1 in 175 births that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published as the national average. The rate was even higher for families living in low-income areas, where 1 in every 112 births ended in stillbirth. The researchers also observed that the stillbirth rate was 1 in every 95 births in areas with higher proportions of Black families compared to White families. Stillbirth rates did not significantly vary according to rurality and levels of access to obstetric care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that while 72.3% of stillbirths had at least one clinical risk factor, a sizable portion of stillbirths occurred with no identified clinical risk factor. Across all of the stillbirths in the study, nearly 27.7% had no risk factor. Later gestational ages showed the highest rates of having no clinical risk factor: Among stillbirths that occurred at 38 weeks gestation, 24.1% had no risk factor; at 39 weeks, 34.2%; and at 40+ weeks, 40.7%. Stillbirth rates were highest among pregnancies with low amniotic fluid levels, fetal anomalies, and chronic hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although momentum toward improving stillbirth research and prevention efforts has increased in recent years, rates in the U.S. remain much higher than in peer countries,” said co-senior author &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/20660/mark-clapp" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Clapp, MD, MPH&lt;/a&gt;, maternal-fetal medicine provider in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Massachusetts General Hospital&lt;/a&gt;. “I hope this study will inform policy, practice changes, and future research to ensure no person or family has to experience this outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that the study’s findings indicate the need for further research into what’s driving socioeconomic variances of stillbirth rates—whether that be social factors, health systems factors, and/or clinical risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haley Sullivan, student in the Harvard PhD Program in Health Policy, was the study’s first author. Harvard Chan’s Anna Sinaiko was also a co-author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleeping with the lights on is linked to a 42% higher risk of heart attack compared to sleeping in darkness, based on a study tracking nearly 90,000 adults over 9 years.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The brightest bedrooms also showed higher risks for heart failure, coronary artery disease, irregular heartbeat, and stroke.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The connection held even after accounting for diet, exercise, smoking, and genetics, suggesting light at night is a factor worth managing for heart health.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Simple fixes like blackout curtains, turning off devices, and keeping bedrooms dark may help protect your heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s the glow from your alarm clock, the TV you fall asleep to, or the hallway light you leave on throughout the night. Whatever the source, sleeping with ambient light might be doing more than disrupting your sleep—it could be affecting your heart. A study of 89,000 people found those with the brightest bedrooms had a 42% higher rate of heart attacks over nearly 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The connection held true regardless of how much people exercised, what they ate, whether they smoked, or how their genes predisposed them to heart disease. Light exposure at night remained linked to cardiovascular health even after accounting for familiar risk factors like poor diet and lack of physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also found elevated risks for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, coronary artery disease, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/irregular-heartbeat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;irregular heartbeat&lt;/a&gt;, and stroke. Researchers tracked 88,905 people in the United Kingdom who wore light-tracking devices on their wrists for one week, then followed their health records for the next 9.5 years. The average age was 62, and about 57% were women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How Researchers Measured Personal Light Exposure Around the Clock&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants wore small sensors on their wrists that recorded light levels around the clock for seven days, collecting approximately 13 million hours of light data total. Rather than relying on satellite data measuring outdoor lighting, this approach captured personal exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers identified daytime light exposure (7:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.) and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-smartphone-screen-insomnia-sleeping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nighttime light exposure&lt;/a&gt; (12:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.), then grouped participants by their light levels. Those with the darkest nights (the bottom half) served as the comparison group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People in moderately bright rooms had a 20% higher risk of heart attack. Those in brighter rooms faced a 27% higher risk. The brightest rooms showed a 47% increase. After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, season, socioeconomic status, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet quality, the risk for the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/light-pollution-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brightest rooms&lt;/a&gt; remained at 42%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Light at Night Disrupts Your Heart Health&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human body runs on circadian rhythms (internal clocks that regulate everything from blood pressure to heart rate to the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;release of stress hormones&lt;/a&gt;). Light is the primary signal that keeps these rhythms synchronized with the 24-hour day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When light hits the eyes at night, it disrupts these rhythms. Blood pressure normally dips during sleep, but exposure to light can keep it elevated. Hormones that should peak in the morning may be released at the wrong times. The balance between the sympathetic nervous system (which activates “fight or flight” responses) and the parasympathetic system (which promotes “rest and digest”) gets thrown off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the short term, circadian disruption raises heart rate, increases inflammation, and promotes blood clotting. Over years, these changes can contribute to atherosclerosis (the hardening of the arteries that sets the stage for heart attacks). When arterial plaques rupture or blood clots form in narrowed vessels, heart muscle tissue gets starved of oxygen, causing a &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research on shift workers, who regularly experience bright light during nighttime hours, has documented higher rates of heart disease for decades. This new study extends those findings to the general population, showing that even ambient light in bedrooms or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sleep-blue-light-glasses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;from devices&lt;/a&gt; can carry risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2840489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that circadian disruption may increase the risk of irregular heartbeats. When the body’s master clock in the brain sends conflicting signals to the heart’s own cellular clocks, the result can be irregular heartbeats that increase stroke risk and reduce the heart’s pumping efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Who Is Most Affected? Women and Younger Adults at Higher Risk&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women appeared more vulnerable to the heart-damaging effects of nighttime light than men, particularly for coronary artery disease and heart failure. Previous research has found that women may be more sensitive to bright light than men, with their circadian systems responding more strongly to the same light levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Younger adults in the study also showed larger increases in risk for heart failure and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/yoga-afib-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; compared to older participants. This pattern could reflect that older adults generally have less sensitive circadian systems, meaning their bodies may not respond as strongly to nighttime light exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Genetic susceptibility to heart disease didn’t change the relationship between light and cardiovascular risk. People with higher genetic risk scores still showed the same association between bright nights and increased disease as those with lower genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Surprising Benefits of Daytime Light Exposure&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first glance, brighter daytime light appeared protective. People exposed to the brightest daytime light had a 13% lower risk of coronary artery disease, a 28% lower risk of heart failure, and a 27% lower risk of stroke compared to those with the darkest days. However, these protective effects disappeared after adjusting for lifestyle factors, particularly physical activity. People who &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spend time outdoors&lt;/a&gt; in bright daylight are also more likely to be physically active, and exercise is a well-established protective factor for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers looked at the effect of bright days without factoring in exercise, the protective effect reappeared for heart failure and stroke, suggesting that daytime light exposure and physical activity may work together to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What This Means for Protecting Your Heart Health&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research was limited by a number of factors warranting acknowledgment. Light exposure was measured for only one week, though participants’ light patterns remained fairly consistent over time. The study couldn’t determine specific light sources (&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/outdoor-lights-diabetes-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;streetlights&lt;/a&gt;, bedroom lamps, televisions, or smartphones). The UK Biobank participants are predominantly White (97%), better educated, higher income, and healthier than the general population. The study is also observational, meaning it shows associations but can’t prove direct causation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide. This study points to avoiding light at night as a new prevention tool. Unlike genetic risk factors, light exposure is modifiable through blackout curtains, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/phone-panic-battery-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;turning off devices&lt;/a&gt;, using dim red lights for necessary nighttime activities, and keeping bedrooms dark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/night-shift-sleep-disorders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shift workers&lt;/a&gt; or those with unavoidable light exposure, managing other cardiovascular risk factors through diet, exercise, and regular health screenings becomes especially important. Darkness matters for heart health. This research shows that sleeping in darkness appears important beyond just sleep duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 88,905 UK Biobank participants who wore light-tracking sensors on their wrists for one week between 2013 and 2016. The sensors recorded light exposure continuously, capturing approximately 13 million hours of data. Participants were then followed through health records until November 2022, a span of about 9.5 years. The researchers used factor analysis to identify two distinct time windows: daytime light exposure (7:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.) and nighttime light exposure (12:30 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.). They divided participants into four groups based on their light exposure percentiles: 0-50th (darkest), 51st-70th, 71st-90th, and 91st-100th (brightest). Cardiovascular disease diagnoses came from hospital admission records, primary care records, self-reports, and death registers. The conditions tracked included coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (heart attack), heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Statistical models used Cox proportional hazards analysis adjusted at three levels for various confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants exposed to the brightest nighttime light (91st-100th percentiles) had significantly higher risks for all five cardiovascular outcomes compared to those in the darkest environments (0-50th percentiles). The adjusted hazard ratios in the most adjusted model were 1.23 for coronary artery disease, 1.42 for myocardial infarction, 1.45 for heart failure, 1.28 for atrial fibrillation, and 1.28 for stroke. Dose-response relationships were observed, meaning higher light exposure correlated with higher disease risk across the percentile groups. The associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for established cardiovascular risk factors including physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, pre-existing diabetes, hypertension, body mass index, cholesterol levels, and genetic susceptibility. Women showed larger-magnitude associations between nighttime light and heart failure and coronary artery disease compared to men. Younger participants in the cohort showed stronger associations between nighttime light and heart failure and atrial fibrillation compared to older participants. Brighter daytime light showed some protective associations with cardiovascular outcomes in initial models, but these effects were not statistically significant after adjusting for lifestyle factors, particularly physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Light exposure was measured for only one week per participant, which may not fully capture long-term patterns, although previous research indicates individual light patterns remain relatively stable over time. The study could not determine the sources of nighttime light exposure, so researchers couldn’t distinguish between different types of light (streetlights, electronic devices, indoor lighting). The UK Biobank cohort is predominantly White (97%), better educated, higher income, and healthier than the general UK population, which may limit how well the findings apply to more diverse groups. Some covariates such as physical activity and pre-existing health conditions may lie on the causal pathway between light exposure and cardiovascular disease, making it difficult to determine whether adjusting for them is appropriate. The study is observational, meaning it can show associations but cannot prove that nighttime light directly causes cardiovascular disease. Information about some variables was collected before light tracking and may have changed during the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Raw meat goo makes prime real estate for microbes, and a new study suggests these luxuriously moist abodes are a significant source of hidden foodborne illnesses, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-6-common-habits-could-be-putting-your-bladder-at-risk"&gt;urinary tract infections&lt;/a&gt; (UTIs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/nearly-1-5-urinary-tract-infections-linked-contaminated-meat"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; microbiologist Lance Price of George Washington University (GW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the association between meat and UTIs was stronger in specific geographic areas. People living in low-income neighborhoods had a 60 percent higher risk of foodborne UTIs compared to those in wealthier locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your risk of infection should not depend on your ZIP code," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/nearly-1-5-urinary-tract-infections-linked-contaminated-meat"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/its-official-cranberries-can-reduce-risk-of-uti-by-50-in-certain-people"&gt;It's Official: Cranberries Can Reduce Risk of UTI by 50% in Certain People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people suffer from UTIs every year. Women &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-standard-uti-test-is-leaving-many-women-without-appropriate-treatment-claims-new-study"&gt;are especially susceptible&lt;/a&gt; and can end up with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-women-are-living-with-recurrent-utis-as-they-grow-resistant-to-antibiotics"&gt;stubborn, recurring infections&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/many-women-in-the-us-are-receiving-improper-treatment-for-utis-study-reveals"&gt;incorrect treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leading cause of these infections is the bacterium &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So GW bioinformatician Maliha Aziz and colleagues studied more than 5,700 &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; samples collected between 2017 and 2021 from patients with UTIs and retail meat, analyzing their genomes to understand how they were connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revealed up to 20 percent of the UTI strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; matched known foodborne strains with animal origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contamination rates were also highest among poultry products, especially turkey meat, suggesting that these products may pose the greatest infection risk," Aziz and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01428-25"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat contaminants likely spread when hands, surfaces, and utensils are not properly sanitized. &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2019/08/20/washing-raw-poultry-our-science-your-choice"&gt;Here's the advice&lt;/a&gt; from the US Department of Agriculture and the new study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure meat and poultry are securely sealed when purchasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare meat last, after all other foods (including fruits and vegetables)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a dedicated chopping board for raw meat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-washing-raw-chicken-is-dangerous"&gt;not wash raw meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrub hands with soap &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-to-correctly-wash-hands-food-contamination-kitchen"&gt;for at least 20 seconds&lt;/a&gt; between touching raw meat and anything else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a food thermometer to make sure chicken is heated to at least 74 °C (165 °F), 71 °C (160 °F) for ground meats like burgers, and 63 °C (145 °F) for other meats&lt;/li&gt;

But they caution more work is needed to assess other potential sources of UTI-causing &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This opens up new avenues for prevention, especially for vulnerable communities that bear a disproportionate burden," &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/nearly-1-5-urinary-tract-infections-linked-contaminated-meat"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Price. "This is why we should be investing more, not less, in research about the social determinants of health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01428-25"&gt;mBio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/tag/direct-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Direct Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, she spotlights themes from her inbox that help explain the modern workplace and how we could be navigating it better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2glh86005r3b78odevcpvm@published"&gt;Workplace “wellness” initiatives—like free yoga classes, mindfulness tips, step challenges, diet advice, and other pushes for well-being now common at work—are supposed to be a win–win situation: Employees get healthier and happier while employers reap the benefits of lower health care costs. But in practice, these programs frequently miss the mark, and many employees perceive them as intrusive and out of touch.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="30" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gdlvk000o3b787pbtluea@published"&gt;Here’s how &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2021/09/companies-lip-service-about-self-care-isnt-what-employees-need.html#comment-3565275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;one person&lt;/a&gt; who wrote to me responded when their company announced that the topics for their monthly wellness trainings would include fitness, nutrition, meditation, body image, and “resilience”:&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmh2ged5f001j3b788ku4sgh8@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="67"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boss told my team that he wants us all to attend unless we have an urgent deadline and … why? None of these topics are my company’s business! They aren’t my doctor or my therapist. I’m here to work, not to get lectured by my employer about how healthy kale is, and I really don’t want to spend any time discussing my body image with colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gexc5001u3b78z2tw5bnd@published"&gt;This reaction speaks for a lot of employees. When workplace wellness programs fail to account for the boundaries that many people prefer to have with their employers, they end up creating discomfort and resentment instead of fostering the well-being they purport to promote.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gf01f00253b78q5eoe2gf@published"&gt;Probably nowhere is this more visible than when employers try to give out &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2019/06/my-employer-is-asking-invasive-questions-as-part-of-a-wellness-benefit.html#comment-2524011"&gt;diet advice&lt;/a&gt;—a topic that can be loaded under the best of circumstances and where advice can’t be one-size-fits all:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had health insurance through my husband’s employer, we both had to do wellness questionnaires. Since I have chronic health problems, I was required to talk to a “health coach” on the phone. Her big solution for me was to make goulash so I’d have a healthy lunch available and wouldn’t have to cook during my lunch break (I work from home). Yeah, like goulash is gonna cure my lupus. To top it all off, the company’s insurance was the worst I’ve ever had. The plan had a huge deductible/huge out-of-pocket max, and they didn’t pay &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;expenses until the deductible had been met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="8" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gfjtp002q3b78xox1tlh9@published"&gt;A similarly irritated worker sent me &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2019/12/fitness-emails-accidentally-sent-personal-email.html"&gt;this account&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;blockquote data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-blockquote/instances/cmh2gfssu00313b78ikufryca@published" class="slate-blockquote" data-word-count="89"&gt;
  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My company includes an on-site fitness center, and all the employees receive periodic emails from the fitness staff. There’s one kind of message they frequently send that bothers me a lot—talking about food and exercise in a really negative, kind of accusatory way that tends to moralize “good” vs. “bad” choices. For example, before Thanksgiving we all got an email listing exactly how many calories a serving of X food would contain, and exactly how much exercise of Y variety we would need to do to “burn it off.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh2gh9vf003c3b78djv5z8f4@published"&gt;Not only do these messages annoy people who don’t come to work to be scolded about food, they can be outright harmful to anyone with a history of disordered eating. Yet workplaces continue to &lt;a href="https://www.askamanager.org/2016/08/workplace-weight-loss-programs-and-eating-disorders-giving-a-reference-for-a-coworker-who-drinks-heavily-and-more.html"&gt;assume&lt;/a&gt; that all employees want to lose weight, and all want support from their employers in doing it:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My workplace just decided to do a casual, team-wide weight loss competition. Participation is voluntary and each participant puts money in the pot initially, plus a dollar for every pound lost. The winner wins the pot at the end. This hit me hard because I have an eating disorder, and I avoid those teammates who like to talk about their eating and diet habits all the time. But now everybody around me is talking about it all the time, and I thank god nobody has asked me if I am participating yet (everybody is doing it, not just overweight people). This is seriously triggering and upsetting for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other people may be trying to establish a healthier relationship with dieting, or might need to maintain their weight or gain weight, or simply might not consider their diet or their weight to be any of their employer’s business and don’t want to engage with their co-workers about it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really wish employers would think more about the various wellness messaging they put out and how likely it is to backfire or grate on people’s nerves. The “Tips for good sleep!” always seem to come out the day after one of my kids was up all night with an ear infection. There’s a poster in our building with wellness tips that includes “Do relaxing activities for 2-3 hours before bed,” and I’m like, “We’re a family with two full-time working parents and two young kids. When exactly am I supposed to do the dishes or clean the house or clear out my inbox or exercise?” That overly chipper tone that makes it sound like you’re just a few easy life hacks away from living your best life comes across as so clueless about the realities of people’s lives. And it’s worse for people who have disabilities or medical conditions or major life stresses that make adhering to some of these wellness tips even more impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My officially logged task/ticket list just hit 200 things to do because my team of 2.25 people is understaffed by at least 2 full-time people. And the continual step-count challenges, weight loss tips, and “combat burnout by taking time to practice mindfulness” emails do nothing but raise my blood pressure and irritation levels when what we need is management to stop spending money on nutritionist consulting services and instead hire more employees. It is starting to feel like they’re pushing the responsibility for failure onto their burnt-out employees because in their eyes obviously we wouldn’t be having problems with the workload if we did all the things the emails told us to do. I’d much rather they address the chronic understaffing problems than anything else right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But those things cost money, and workshops about the importance of nutrition and meditation—and apparently advisers who recommend “goulash”—are a whole lot &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;cheaper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Dr. Kawashima and Nintendo were right: brain-training games can actually have a significant positive effect and reduce the effects of aging on our brain. A &lt;a href="https://games.jmir.org/2025/1/e75161"&gt;new scientific study&lt;/a&gt; has found that as much as a decade of aging may be offset by our efforts playing them, which is good news if you spent a very long time playing Brain Training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key finding was that doing rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes a day boosts the chemical messenger acetylcholine, which not only carries messages across the brain but improves learning, memory and attention functions. Acetylcholine levels typically deplete with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;a class="button video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5QusYYL9fs" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Watch on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The study monitored 95 people over the age of 65 years for 10 weeks and found a 2.3 percent rise in acetylcholine after doing brain training exercises for 30 minutes a day. As &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/nx-s1-5581409/mental-exercise-reverse-brain-change-aging-acetylcholine?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;amp;utm_term=nprnews&amp;amp;utm_source=bsky.app"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; noted in an article about the report, 2.3 percent doesn't sound enormous, but when you consider there's usually a decrease of 2.5 percent &lt;em&gt;per decade&lt;/em&gt; due to aging, it reframes the discovery. Brain-training games may offset as much as a decade of degradation caused by aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="injection_placeholder" data-position="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an important distinction to make, though. In order to achieve the desired result, you need to play games that are specifically designed to exercise these parts of your brain, such as Nintendo's Brain Training once was. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush"&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/a&gt; and solitaire won't do it; they were what half of the participants played during the test and their acetylcholine levels didn't change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Ryuta Kawashima was the neuroscientist Nintendo's games were developed in collaboration with, and brain age (as the game was titled in Japan) and dementia prevention are specific areas of expertise of his. In other words: this is exactly the sort of thing he was trying to achieve with his Nintendo games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brain Training games first appeared here in 2006. They were made up of many mind-stretching games based around maths, memory recall, and many other things, and you'd play them every day and the game would give a score based on your performance. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-brainage-ds"&gt;We gave the original Brain Training 9/10 in our review&lt;/a&gt;, and the series would go on to have numerous sequels and even a Switch version released in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

            If you’re experiencing joint pain in the knees, the solution might be to walk it off.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000g3b6nzh6j6eeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aerobic exercise can reduce pain, improve movement and enhance quality of life for patients with knee osteoarthritis, according to a study published October 15 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2025-085242" target="_blank"&gt;The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1 in 5 adults&lt;/a&gt;, or 54 million people, are affected by some type of arthritis in the United States. The most common form is osteoarthritis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000i3b6nb21hx7ai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Osteoarthritis is wear and tear of cartilage, or the covering at the end of bones, which leads to pain, stiffness and decreased joint function,” said Dr. Antonia F. Chen, chair and professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, via email. She was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000j3b6n8168wqph@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is incredibly common — sources have estimated that &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/5599-osteoarthritis" target="_blank"&gt;80% of adults&lt;/a&gt; greater than 55 years old have some arthritis, and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis" target="_blank"&gt;500 million people&lt;/a&gt; are affected by osteoarthritis worldwide.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000k3b6nl6vzdugs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/osteoarthritis#:~:text=Key%20facts,benefit%20from%20rehabilitation%20(3)." target="_blank"&gt;causes of osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; include injury, preexisting joint disease, specific metabolic diseases such as obesity or type 2 diabetes, and genetics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000l3b6nkuvlmu1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3766936/" target="_blank"&gt;chronic disability&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the most commonly affected joints is the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21750-osteoarthritis-knee" target="_blank"&gt;knee&lt;/a&gt;. While knee osteoarthritis isn’t reversible, there are ways to reduce pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000m3b6nvk14owjx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Aerobic exercise consistently showed the greatest benefits across almost all outcomes,’ said Dr. Lei Yan, the study’s first author, in an email. “It reduced pain, improved movement and gait performance, and enhanced overall quality of life more effectively than any other exercise type.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000n3b6n7s8rsc41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/7050-aerobic-exercise" target="_blank"&gt;Aerobic exercises&lt;/a&gt; are rhythmic and repetitive movements, such as walking, jogging, cycling and swimming.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000o3b6n4h04a012@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aerobic exercises “help nourish the joints, they strengthen supporting muscles, and they reduce pain,” said CNN fitness contributor Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000p3b6nm7z1sgx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients with knee osteoarthritis should be doing “low to moderate-impact aerobic activity. This is not high-impact aerobic activity, and people with knee osteoarthritis should definitely avoid running or plyometrics, like jump training,” Santas said  .
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000q3b6nl3lbhqlt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You don’t have to aim immediately for &lt;a href="http://cnn.com/2025/07/23/health/daily-steps-how-many-wellness"&gt;10,000 steps&lt;/a&gt; a day or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/25/health/world-health-organization-physical-activity-guidelines-wellness/index.html"&gt;150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of exercise a week, which are both common recommendations for exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000r3b6n28ekwkla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For patients just starting to exercise, walking or cycling for five to 10 minutes a day can help you get started in receiving those benefits and restrengthening the muscles around your joints, according to Santas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000s3b6nyolg3ia6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But before starting any movement, you should properly warm up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000t3b6nbulrkw3f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can start by “mobilizing of your ankles and your hips” with stretches, such as ankle circles or simple &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/hip-exercises-knee-pain-relief-wellness"&gt;hip mobility&lt;/a&gt; stretches, Santas said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000u3b6n8k52k20b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Being conscious of your body during these exercises and pacing yourself is also key.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000v3b6nb59leac9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And it’s important for people &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/health-fitness/best-knee-brace?utm_source=internal&amp;amp;utm_medium=mainsite&amp;amp;utm_id=features"&gt;managing knee osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt; to avoid doing deep squats and twisting their hips because if hips are tight, then the movement is “going to go to the joint above or below, which is the knee,” Santas said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000w3b6n6uhx7fys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No matter what aerobic exercise you choose to do, you should “ensure that your knees, which are a hinge joint, aren’t being asked to do something that they’re not designed to do, because that’s only going to cause more issues,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000x3b6ny6swzjv4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similar to aerobic exercises, low  or moderate-impact strength training can also help patients with knee osteoarthritis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000y3b6nsxemjen1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An easy exercise to start with is a single-leg Romanian deadlift or RDL.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn000z3b6ndpnrpvku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This movement can be modified by shifting your weight to one leg and coming “onto the toes of the opposite leg, so that you’re not putting weight” on the nonworking leg, according to Santas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn00103b6nnmxm5hiy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re struggling with balance, you can also hold onto a wall, “and then you’re just hinging from your hips to come down and then back up,” she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn00113b6nk9m2vni5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/osteoarthritis-knee-exercises-stretches" target="_blank"&gt;exercises&lt;/a&gt; include stair stepping and leg extensions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn00123b6n196wfsx4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While strength training and aerobic exercise can improve mobility, “the benefits depend on consistency — patients don’t need to train intensely, but they do need to keep moving regularly,” said Yan, a doctoral student at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn00133b6n00w8f22m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aside from exercise, other methods of treating pain caused by osteoarthritis include acupuncture, weight loss, anti-inflammatory supplements and physical therapy, according to Chen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn00143b6nr9gtjdnc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But as always, you should contact your doctor or medical professional before pursuing any forms of treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh54gkkn00153b6nluh1aqwu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study’s findings were based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis that looked at 217 randomized controlled trials with over 15,000 participants from around the world. Researchers analyzed the impact of seven exercises and followed up with participants after four, 12 and 24 weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to spend countless hours at the gym to see noticeable results. For those 50+, shorter, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-hiit-exercises-melt-love-handles/" target="_blank"&gt;high-intensity workouts&lt;/a&gt; and a well-structured routine can promote &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/14-must-try-exercises-for-men-to-build-muscle/" target="_blank"&gt;muscle gains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/reverse-lunge-knee-drive-mobility-test-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;boost mobility&lt;/a&gt;, and improve metabolism just as effectively—”sometimes even better,” says &lt;b&gt;Josh York&lt;/b&gt;, founder and CEO, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.gymguyz.com/" target="_blank"&gt;GYMGUYZ&lt;/a&gt;. The trick? Engaging multiple muscle groups at once, maintaining an elevated heart rate, and performing a combo of strength, mobility, and balance exercises. Below, York breaks down a productive &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/8-minute-morning-bodyweight-routine-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;eight-minute morning routine&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-minute-morning-routine-reverse-aging-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;reverses aging&lt;/a&gt; better than hour-long gym sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out first thing in the AM jumpstarts your metabolism, helps regulate hormones, and establishes an all-around positive vibe for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“For older adults, morning movement improves energy levels, mental clarity, and circulation, while consistent morning activity has been linked to improved longevity and better sleep patterns,” York explains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By combining strength, mobility, balance, and cardio in a rapid, focused circuit, this routine activates key anti-aging mechanisms: building lean muscle, improving circulation, enhancing joint health, and stimulating metabolism,” York tells us. “Eight minutes done consistently can outperform a drawn-out, unfocused hour-long session for energy, muscle preservation, and overall strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perform each move for 45 seconds, then take a 15-second break to rest. Repeat the sequence to lengthen the intensity, if preferred, but York assures this single circuit gets the job done in just eight minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bodyweight squat is a tried-and-true classic trainers love. This move builds killer strength in the core, glutes, and legs while boosting mobility and balance. Pro tip from York? Keep your knees behind your toes, your core engaged, and your chest tall throughout the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin the exercise by standing tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms in front of you or place your hands on your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the knees and hips as you lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to descend until your thighs are parallel to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the exercise for 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pushup to shoulder tap builds stability in your core and upper body. If needed, feel free to perform knee pushups. Use control as you tap each hand to your opposite shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin in a high plank—hands under your shoulders and body straight. Engage your core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the elbows and lower your chest toward the floor to perform a pushup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the top, lift your right hand off the ground and tap your left shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your right hand down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform another pushup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the top, tap your left hand to your right shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you perform the knee-to-elbow twist while seated or standing, expect to give your obliques and core a stellar workout while boosting rotational mobility and challenging your balance. York recommends moving through the exercise slowly to really feel the twist in your core.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin the exercise standing tall, hands at the back of your head.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your left knee as you twist your torso and bring your right elbow toward it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your right knee as you twist your torso and bring your left elbow to meet it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to alternate sides, performing the exercise for 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 15 seconds before moving into the next exercise.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reverse lunge with arm reach builds leg strength, enhances balance, and opens up the chest. York suggests stepping back, lowering gently, and lifting both arms overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To begin, stand tall with your feet hip-distance apart and arms at the sides of your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step your left foot back to assume a lunge position and lower. Be sure to keep your front knee stacked over your ankle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift both arms overhead as you descend, lowering until your front thigh is parallel to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the exercise for 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 15 seconds before moving into the next exercise.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standing row with a resistance band fires up the back, shoulders, and posture muscles. York recommends keeping your elbows close to the sides of your body and squeezing the shoulder blades together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor a resistance band at chest level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, facing the anchor point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the handles with both hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and pull the band toward your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your shoulder blades together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms back to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the exercise for 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 15 seconds before moving into the next exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glute bridge march fires up the glutes and core while improving hip mobility. All you need is a yoga mat and your body weight to get started. York notes to lift your hips, alternate leans, and keep your core tight throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back with bent knees and feet on the floor. Keep your arms at your sides, palms facing down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push through your heels to lift your hips into a glute bridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the top, lift one knee to your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to lower, and switch sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the exercise for 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 15 seconds before moving into the next exercise.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standing calf raise enhances circulation and ankle mobility. This exercise improves balance and walking strength, both of which are essential for preventing falls as you age. York says to pause once you reach the top of the raise, squeeze your calves, and control your descent to maximize the benefits of the movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin by standing tall with your feet hip-width apart. Engage your core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rise onto your toes slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower back down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the exercise for 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 15 seconds before moving into the next exercise.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, York recommends performing high knees or marching in place. This exercise boosts heart rate and gives your body energy to conquer the day. Lift your knees to hip level, pump your arms, and engage your abs throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-distance apart and arms at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your right knee up toward your chest, as high as you’re able to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the same time, swing your left arm forward and right arm back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternate sides at a fast pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the exercise for 45 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest for 15 seconds before moving into the next exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;It started with a donut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning in her 20s, Jessie Inchauspé says, she grabbed her usual sugary breakfast on her way to work in Silicon Valley — and noticed something strange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her new fitness tracker showed her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/5-warning-signs-you-might-have-high-blood-sugar-doctors-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;blood sugar spiking&lt;/a&gt;, then crashing. The pattern mirrored her bouts of brain fog, anxiety, and exhaustion, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It might seem obvious today that what we eat impacts our mental health, but back then, for me, I hadn't connected the dots," Inchauspé told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That moment sent Inchauspé — now known to millions online as the Glucose Goddess — down a rabbit hole. She joined a pilot study using a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/glucose-monitors-over-the-counter-track-blood-sugar-health-fitness-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt; (or, CGM), devices that were typically reserved for people with diabetes, to see how food affected the day-to-day mood and energy of otherwise healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, she&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has built a massive brand around the insights she took away from that turning point. More than 5 million people follow her on Instagram, where she shares what she calls "glucose hacks" for steady energy, metabolism, and sleep cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CGMs have since exploded in popularity among athletes, CEOs, and ordinary people trying to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-lost-weight-blood-sugar-tracking-continuous-glucose-monitor-tips-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; or to feel less sluggish. Some are now sold without a prescription, such as the Stelo, a device from Dexcom that Inchauspé has partnered with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science behind blood-sugar "optimization" is evolving. It's normal to have occasional dips and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-for-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-doctor-advice-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;spikes in blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, and researchers have not yet determined what the optimal range might be for people without diabetes. Dietitians caution that self-tracking can sometimes lead to overanalyzing normal biological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Inchauspé said she's seen lasting benefits in her day-to-day life from understanding her blood sugar and adopting a few simple strategies that echo long-standing nutritional advice.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;"Saying that glucose only matters if you have diabetes is to me like saying brushing your teeth only matters if you have cavities," Inchauspé told Business Insider. "We all feel the effects of our glucose levels on a daily basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three simple changes that she says made the biggest difference for her health, and how they stack up with nutrition advice.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, a high-protein breakfast has become a non-negotiable for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anchoring your day with a protein-rich breakfast that keeps you steady is really, really key," Inchauspé said.

            &lt;p&gt;Inchauspé used to snack on grapes, assuming they were healthy, until she noticed they led to an afternoon slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just thought, 'oh, they're so healthy. They're fruit, they're so natural,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, she prefers an apple with peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;serving of grapes has a fraction of the fiber as an apple, so the sugars digest more quickly, leading to a fast boost that doesn't last. The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dietitian-shares-best-high-fiber-recipes-better-energy-gut-health-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gut-healthy fiber&lt;/a&gt; in an apple, combined with the healthy fats in nut butter, helps smooth out the digestive process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individual responses to carbs can vary widely, though. New research even suggests people have different "glucotypes" that influence how their bodies handle sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm all for being as balanced and nuanced as possible. A donut is not the best thing for your blood sugar, but I would never tell you, 'you could not ever eat a donut ever again,'" Inchauspé said. "That would be ridiculous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="75fa06d1-a83b-41a2-bbb0-0a907eea9f61" data-toc-id="75fa06d1-a83b-41a2-bbb0-0a907eea9f61"&gt;The takeaway&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists continue to study what blood-sugar tracking means for healthy people, Inchauspé's popularity underscores a growing trend: people want data — and simple changes — to feel more energized and in control of their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Take a common-sense approach to your diet — don't try to restrict too much, and be mindful of your own unique needs and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116613" target="_blank"&gt;Psychiatry Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that while parent-reported symptoms of ADHD remained stable in boys, there was a small but statistically significant increase in symptoms among girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication and interaction, along with restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, is another neurodevelopmental condition marked by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that can interfere with functioning or development. Over the past two decades, the number of clinical diagnoses for both conditions has increased substantially in many Western countries, particularly among teenagers and young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trend has raised questions about whether the underlying traits associated with these conditions are becoming more common in the general population. Researchers sought to investigate this possibility by looking beyond clinical diagnoses to the level of symptoms reported by parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The frequency of clinical diagnoses of ASD and ADHD has increased substantially over the past decades across the world,” said study author Olof Arvidsson, a PhD student at the &lt;a href="https://www.gu.se/en/gnc" target="_blank"&gt;Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre&lt;/a&gt; at Gothenburg University and resident physician in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The largest prevalence increase has been among teenagers and young adults. Therefore, we wanted to investigate if symptoms of ASD and ADHD in the population had increased over time in 18-year-olds. In this study we used data from a twin study in Sweden in which parents reported on symptoms of ASD and ADHD when their children turned 18 and investigated whether symptoms had increased between year 2011 to 2019.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct their analysis, the researchers utilized data from a large, ongoing project called the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden. This study follows twins born in Sweden to learn more about mental and physical health. For this specific investigation, researchers focused on information collected from the parents of nearly 10,000 twins born between 1993 and 2001. When the twins reached their 18th birthday, their parents were asked to complete a web-based questionnaire about their children’s behaviors and traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents answered a set of 12 questions designed to measure symptoms related to autism. These items correspond to the diagnostic criteria for ASD. For ADHD, parents completed a 17-item checklist covering problems associated with inattention and executive function, which are core components of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this data, the researchers employed statistical methods to analyze whether the average symptom scores changed across the nine different birth years, from 1993 to 2001. They also looked at the percentage of individuals who scored in the highest percentiles, representing those with the most significant number of traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed no increase in the average level of parent-reported autism symptoms among 18-year-olds across the nine-year span. This stability was observed for both boys and girls. Similarly, when the researchers examined the proportion of individuals with the highest symptom scores, defined as those in the top five percent, they found no statistically significant change over time. This suggests that the prevalence of autism-related traits in the young adult population remained constant during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results for ADHD presented a more nuanced picture. Among boys, the data indicated that parent-reported ADHD symptoms were stable. There was no significant change in either the average symptom scores or in the percentage of boys scoring in the top 10 percent. For girls, however, the study identified a small but statistically detectable increase in ADHD symptoms over the nine birth years. This trend was apparent in both the average symptom scores and in the proportion of girls who scored in the top 10 percent for ADHD traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being statistically significant, the researchers note that the magnitude of this increase in girls was small. The year of birth explained only a very small fraction of the variation in ADHD symptom scores. The results suggest that while there may be a slight upward trend in certain ADHD symptoms among adolescent girls, it is not nearly large enough to account for the substantial increase in clinical ADHD diagnoses reported in this group. The study provides evidence that the steep rise in both autism and ADHD diagnoses is likely influenced by factors other than a simple increase in the symptoms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Across the nine birth years examined, there was no sign of increasing symptoms of ASD in the population, despite rising diagnoses,” Arvidsson told PsyPost. “For ADHD, there was no increase among boys. However, in 18-year-old girls we saw a very small but statistically significant increase in ADHD symptoms. The increase in absolute numbers was small in relation to the increase in clinical diagnoses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose several alternative explanations for the growing number of diagnoses. Increased public and professional awareness may lead more people to seek assessments. Diagnostic criteria for both conditions have also widened over the years, potentially including individuals who would not have met the threshold in the past. Another factor may be a change in perception, where certain behaviors are now seen as more impairing than they were previously. This aligns with other research indicating that parents today tend to report higher levels of dysfunction associated with the same number of symptoms compared to a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in societal demands, particularly in educational settings that place a greater emphasis on executive functioning and complex social skills, could also contribute. In some cases, a formal diagnosis may be a prerequisite for accessing academic support and resources, creating an incentive for assessment. For the slight increase in ADHD symptoms among girls, the authors suggest it could reflect better recognition of how ADHD presents in females, or perhaps an overlap with symptoms of anxiety and depression, which have also been on the rise in this demographic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The takeaway is that the increases in clinical diagnoses of both ASD and ADHD need to be explained by other factors than increasing symptoms in the population, such as increased awareness and increased perceived impairment related to ASD and ADHD symptoms,” Arvidsson said. “Taken together we also hope to curb any worries about a true increase in ASD or ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has some limitations. The response rate for the parental questionnaires was about 41 percent. While the researchers checked for potential biases and found that their main conclusions about the trends over time were likely unaffected, a higher participation rate would strengthen the findings. Additionally, the questionnaire for ADHD primarily measured symptoms of inattention and did not include items on hyperactivity. The results, therefore, mainly speak to the inattentive aspects of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore these trends with different measures and in different populations. The researchers also plan to investigate trends in clinical diagnoses more closely to better understand resource allocation for healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to better understand trends of clinical diagnoses, such as trends of incidence of diagnoses in different groups,” Arvidsson said. “With increasing clinical diagnoses of ASD and ADHD and the resulting impact on the healthcare system as well as on the affected patients, it is important to characterize these trends in order to motivate an increased allocation of resources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2025.116613" target="_blank"&gt;ASD and ADHD symptoms in 18-year-olds – A population-based study of twins born 1993 to 2001&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Olof Arvidsson, Isabell Brikell, Henrik Larsson, Paul Lichtenstein, Ralf Kuja-Halkola, Mats Johnson, Christopher Gillberg, and Sebastian Lundström.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:06:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNWklQNk0wZ1pBY3lpdElDTF9tdkxLVVJuZlk4Sm81bWJFUkstM01pakRQdVc0QjFYRWwyTUlCME1nWkdLc0NfcUc2dlFxXzJGRDRkWU91aU9rWmQxb2lrX29RdGNYd1BIX3pSOERoQWk4YXhOSUFXZHppNEdwZEMtaDJOYUpvakJGTzZEUDZEMnhoYi10UkQyWDdmbVo</guid></item><item><title>医生对心力衰竭的可怕警告： “如果你晚上不刷牙，你可能会……” -印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/physicians-dire-warning-for-heart-failure-if-you-skip-brushing-your-teeth-at-night-you-might-be-/articleshow/124818504.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing your teeth before bed might feel like a small task, but it plays a major role in maintaining both your oral and overall health. For many people, the nighttime brushing routine often gets skipped due to tiredness, forgetfulness, or a busy lifestyle. However, experts warn that missing this step regularly can lead to more serious consequences than just cavities or bad breath. Recent medical research has found strong evidence linking poor oral hygiene, particularly skipping the nighttime brushing habit, with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Doctors and researchers suggest that what happens inside your mouth can directly impact your heart health over time, making it important to maintain consistent oral care habits every day. Take a look&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why brushing before bed is important&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing before bed helps remove food particles, plaque, and bacteria that accumulate throughout the day. When these are not cleaned, bacteria continue to grow inside the mouth overnight. During sleep, the body produces less saliva, which means harmful bacteria are not washed away as effectively as they are during the day. This bacterial buildup not only damages teeth and gums but also allows bacteria to enter the bloodstream through the gums, potentially leading to inflammation in other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Failure Warning: 4 Symptoms You Might Be Overlooking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists recommend brushing at least twice daily using fluoride toothpaste, with one brushing session ideally right before going to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice helps prevent plaque formation, tooth decay, and gum infections such as gingivitis and periodontitis, all of which can contribute to broader health complications if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Skipping nighttime brushing raises &lt;keyword id="117152" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="heart-disease-risk" source="Orion"&gt;heart disease risk&lt;/keyword&gt;: Study finds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-abstract/40/14/1138/5251907" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the European Heart Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that people who skipped brushing their teeth at night were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems compared to those who brushed regularly. The study suggested that maintaining good oral hygiene might help reduce the risk of heart disease and even heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Kunal Sood’s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPmocKBAOaa/?igsh=dHZwaWs0YzdrYzFv" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a double-board-certified medical doctor and general physician, the results are clear enough to highlight a close connection between oral hygiene and heart health. In an informative social media post, he explained that neglecting nighttime brushing could allow harmful oral bacteria to travel through the bloodstream, causing inflammation that affects the heart and blood vessels. Over time, this inflammation can contribute to conditions such as atherosclerosis, where the arteries become hardened or narrowed due to plaque buildup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the research does not claim that poor oral hygiene directly causes heart disease, it points to a significant relationship between the two. Researchers emphasise that maintaining clean and healthy teeth could serve as a preventive measure for cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How &lt;keyword id="6556047" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="oral-health" source="Orion"&gt;oral health&lt;/keyword&gt; affects the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human mouth naturally contains millions of bacteria, most of which are harmless when kept in balance through regular brushing and flossing. However, when oral hygiene is neglected, harmful bacteria multiply and can enter the bloodstream through bleeding gums or infections. Once in the bloodstream, these bacteria can trigger an inflammatory response from the body’s immune system. Chronic inflammation is one of the key risk factors associated with heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association and several global studies have reported that individuals with gum disease, also known as periodontitis, tend to have a higher risk of developing heart-related conditions. These include coronary artery disease, heart failure, and even certain heart valve infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation caused by oral bacteria may lead to the formation of fatty deposits in blood vessels, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. This can increase the chances of heart attacks and other cardiovascular complications. Hence, keeping your gums and teeth healthy is not just about appearance; it is closely linked to protecting your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dental problems that can raise heart risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor oral hygiene can lead to several dental problems, many of which have been connected to heart health issues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gum disease (Periodontitis)&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a severe infection that damages soft tissue and bone supporting the teeth. It allows bacteria to enter the bloodstream easily, promoting inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooth loss&lt;/strong&gt;: Missing teeth may indicate long-term gum disease or bone loss, both of which are linked to a higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untreated cavities&lt;/strong&gt;: Decay that progresses deep into the tooth can cause infections, which in some cases may spread to other organs through the bloodstream.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;: Swelling or redness in the gums signals infection and can increase the body’s inflammatory response, putting stress on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These issues highlight how closely dental and heart health are related, emphasising the importance of preventive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Expert recommendations for maintaining oral hygiene&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce the risk of oral and heart health problems, experts recommend following a consistent dental care routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brush at least twice daily&lt;/strong&gt;: Once after waking up and once before bed, using fluoride toothpaste.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floss regularly&lt;/strong&gt;: Flossing removes food particles and plaque between teeth where brushes cannot reach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use mouthwash&lt;/strong&gt;: Antibacterial mouthwash helps control bacterial growth and keeps breath fresh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit your dentist every six months&lt;/strong&gt;: Regular check-ups help detect early signs of gum disease or decay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit sugary foods and drinks&lt;/strong&gt;: Sugar fuels bacteria that cause plaque and cavities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoking&lt;/strong&gt;: Tobacco products increase the risk of gum disease and other infections.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By maintaining these habits, individuals can significantly reduce oral infections and their potential impact on heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Broader link between oral and overall health&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond cardiovascular health, poor oral hygiene has been associated with other systemic conditions such as diabetes, respiratory infections, and complications during pregnancy. In diabetic patients, gum disease can make it harder to control blood sugar levels, while in pregnant women, it may increase the risk of premature birth. These findings further underline that oral hygiene should not be treated as a minor part of personal health but as an essential daily practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key takeaway&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brushing your teeth before bed might seem like a small task, but it can make a big difference to your health. Studies suggest that maintaining good oral hygiene not only prevents tooth decay and gum disease but may also help protect the heart from inflammation and long-term damage. Regular dental care, a healthy diet, and proper cleaning habits remain essential for overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, flossing daily and using an antiseptic mouthwash can further reduce bacteria that cause plaque buildup and gum problems. Routine dental check-ups help catch issues early, ensuring timely treatment. Simple habits like brushing and flossing consistently can have long-lasting effects on both oral and overall health, supporting a healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;(Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be taken as medical advice.

But instead of wrapping it in toilet paper and tossing it into a bin, she put the tampon in a special plastic sample container, screwed the lid on tight and mailed it to an address in Oakland, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The address was that of NextGen Jane (NGJ), a Bay Area-based startup founded in 2014. And now Julia Carr, NGJ’s clinical research coordinator, stands in the company’s lab under a fume hood happily decanting a mixture of the woman’s blood and a preservation solution into a test tube. She will go on to pipette out small amounts to freeze and store for later analysis. NGJ has obtained about 2,500 menstrual blood samples this way – from women volunteering to send in their used tampons – for its research. That Carr is dealing with their period blood does not gross her out in the slightest. “This is a beautiful project for women’s science, and we are exploring a novel sample type,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;[Menstrual blood] is considered waste but in fact it’s a real treasure&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;NGJ is one of a handful of small, mostly women-led “femtech” startups that, alongside a few academic research teams, are in a race to develop blood tests using menstrual effluent collected noninvasively at home. Usually, we use urine, saliva and, of course, blood drawn from our veins to test for a range of medical conditions. The FDA-approved Cologuard test allows people to collect their own feces and send them off for screening for colon and rectal cancer. These groups ask: why not also a fluid that half the world’s population produces monthly for a long stretch of their lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The big emphasis is on diagnosing gynaecological and reproductive health conditions for people who send in their period blood for analysis. But that blood could also be used to help track hormones, screen for cancers, monitor diseases such as diabetes and boost stem cell research. If Theranos became shorthand for Silicon Valley junk science, its proponents put menstrual-blood testing at the other end of the spectrum: an underexplored sample source whose clinical potential is only now being examined with scientific care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c4f64c19-b693-4831-b0b5-5eaa13caf14b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--showcase element-showcase dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;NextGen Jane’s collection kit.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of NextGen Jane&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is an obvious biological specimen that has been totally neglected,” says Christine Metz, who co-leads the Research Outsmarts &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/endometriosis" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Endometriosis&lt;/a&gt; (Rose) project out of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health. “It is considered waste but in fact it’s a real treasure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;No one had given much thought to analyzing menstrual effluent – which contains a mix of tissue from the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) as well as circulating blood and vaginal fluid – for the purpose of medical testing until the mid-2010s, when the Rose project and companies such as NGJ arrived on the scene. (“You matter PERIOD,” reads a tag in one of the stalls of NGJ’s arty, graffiti-decorated bathroom.) What &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m112.018390" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;little work that had been done to test period blood prior&lt;/a&gt; was mostly concerned with distinguishing menstrual from circulating blood, for police forensic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That it was overlooked for so long is not exactly surprising to those in the field. Women – their bodies, their health concerns – have been understudied due to a combination of historical exclusion from clinical research, persistent gender bias and societal stigma around menstruation and reproductive health. Much to do with women’s health research is woefully underfunded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An “ick” factor has slowed research with menstrual blood specifically, according to Renate van der Molen, an immunologist at Radboud University medical center in the Netherlands who uses the fluid to study various gynecological conditions. “It is thought of as dirty, a bit stinky and useless … People hesitate to give a sample,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet tapping menstrual blood makes sense, she says. Not only is it noninvasive and easy to obtain but, most importantly, it is unique in that it contains cells and molecules that reflect the state of a uterus. It can deliver messages to doctors that other bodily fluids may not. It is just “so different” to blood drawn from a vein, says van der Molen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All told, the startups and research groups see huge potential, even if it is early days. And one of the holy grails the field is hotly pursuing is endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="diagnosing-endometriosis" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnosing endometriosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Having an easy test for diagnosing endometriosis would be a breakthrough, says Abigail Trotter, a 23-year-old living with endometriosis from Pennsylvania. That’s why she sent her period blood to NGJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f5a3a370-6edd-485c-b2ca-f0aa5b8a1bc2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"From 24/7 pain to tolerable symptoms, Botox is helping people living with endometriosis ","elementId":"f5a3a370-6edd-485c-b2ca-f0aa5b8a1bc2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/29/from-247-pain-to-tolerable-symptoms-botox-is-helping-people-living-with-endometriosis"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Endometriosis – in which tissue similar to the uterus’s endometrial lining grows outside the uterus in spots known as lesions, causing severe pelvic pain and heavy bleeding, and making it harder to get pregnant – is a debilitating disease. It is estimated to afflict more than 10% of women of reproductive age. Not only is there no cure and limited treatment options, but confirming a diagnosis can be a nightmare: the only way to do it is via laparoscopic surgery, typically performed under general anesthesia. Because endometriosis presents differently in different people and its symptoms resemble those of other conditions, it can take years to even get to the surgical diagnostic stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Trotter was surgically diagnosed with endometriosis late last year, after nearly a decade of pelvic pain and period problems. “All the years you go without it being diagnosed it is spreading, wreaking havoc on your inner parts,” she says. The surgery itself resulted in an under-the-skin infection that laid her so low she missed six weeks of work at the veterinary clinic where she is employed as a technician. (She recently underwent further surgery to remove her lesions robotically and is recovering well.) “A surgical procedure just to have it diagnosed … [That] really does need change,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Trotter came across NGJ’s work while recuperating from her diagnostic surgery and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;got in touch to receive a collection kit. She wanted to help other women avoid what she went through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Developing a noninvasive, at-home test for endometriosis became NGJ’s main focus in 2021, though the company had been asking menstruators to mail in their used tampons for much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After receiving enough samples, the company started hunting for molecular signals of gynaecological conditions by analyzing DNA, RNA and proteins. Particularly strong differences in messenger RNA, the molecule that tells cells which proteins to make and when, between women with and without endometriosis stood out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2e5aab6d-2e75-4159-9eab-6477f1f40712" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--supporting element-supporting dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Ridhi Tariyal.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of NextGen Jane&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We leaned in,” says co-founder and CEO Ridhi Tariyal, noting that the company has fine-tuned its collection kit and is now confirming the approach works. (She remained tight-lipped about which exact biomarkers NGJ is focused on.) Tariyal adds that NGJ’s trove of stored samples provides it with a “jumping-off point” to explore other molecular signals for different gynaecological conditions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other players such as the Rose project are trying to develop a test for endometriosis using a predominately cellular rather than molecular approach, looking for abnormalities in the whole live cells in the period blood of people with the disease. There are differences in the quantity and shape of certain cells in women who have endometriosis versus women who don’t, explain Metz and her co-lead Peter Gregersen. “From that combination we can develop a diagnostic,” says Metz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rather than tampons, the Rose project collects samples with menstrual cups, so it can get the whole live cells. (Indeed, the perception that period blood is just dead material is wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So does Katherine Burns, an associate professor of environmental and public health sciences at the University of Cincinnati, who is also working on a test for endometriosis based on a different set of cellular abnormalities, and who herself lives with endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet menstrual cup collection, as it stands, could be a barrier. The cups can be messy, prone to spills and difficult to insert and remove, particularly for someone who has pelvic pain or has not had their period long (endometriosis starts in the teenage years, and the earlier the condition can be diagnosed the better). Developing a more comfortable and less spillable cup is a goal, say Metz and Gregersen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond endometriosis, proponents point to several gynaecological conditions that menstrual blood could help diagnose – including other disorders of the endometrium such as adenomyosis and chronic endometritis, as well as fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome, and ovarian and endometrial cancers. Many of these conditions also go undetected for years and, in some cases, can only be confirmed through invasive procedures such as an endometrial biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ultimately whichever method proves to be best at detecting endometriosis and when it might become available to buy remains to be seen. All require further studies, including in teens, and none are yet seeking regulatory approval. (While full FDA approval is the gold standard, there is a less tightly regulated but still legitimate &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/laboratory-developed-tests" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pathway&lt;/a&gt; that allows companies to bring tests to market more quickly.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nonetheless, the good news for those with endometriosis, Burns notes, is that there are multiple irons in the fire. “We are all working towards the same goal to help diagnose endometriosis without surgery,” she says. “Do I hope and wish and pray that any of them are correct? You bet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="making-testing-a-reality" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making testing a reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond endometriosis, some startups and research groups are experimenting with a grab bag of other conditions and period blood collection techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;German startup Theblood, founded in 2022, is exploring how to use period blood collected via a menstrual cup to provide women with health status reports. It envisages an at-home test for hormone levels related to fertility, cycle health and perimenopause, typically done via a standard blood draw. It is also looking at inflammation markers with the aim of identifying patterns that might point toward chronic conditions earlier, and has studied using menstrual blood to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13237212" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;monitor vitamin levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;[Using period blood is] the most overlooked opportunity in women’s health&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In May, researchers at ETH Zürich in Switzerland &lt;a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/05/sanitary-towels-morph-into-test-strips.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unveiled a prototype menstrual pad&lt;/a&gt; with a nonelectronic sensor that changes color in the presence of certain proteins in menstrual blood that could indicate disease, including potentially cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Then there is Qvin, another ambitious Bay Area-based startup also founded in 2014, which may be farthest ahead in the race to make menstrual blood testing a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, the company became the first to receive FDA approval for a special menstrual pad and test for women already diagnosed with diabetes to track blood sugar levels – an A1C test but using period blood rather than blood from a vein. The pad has a special collection strip where a small amount of blood pools and dries before it is mailed in to Qvin for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, Qvin has stopped offering the test directly on its website for the time being and pivoted to include a different market: governments and health organizations, particularly in the global south, seeking inexpensive and more convenient ways of detecting diseases for the millions of women they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“[Using period blood is] the most overlooked opportunity in women’s health,” says co-CEO Sara Naseri. “We can make it easy for women to get information about what’s going on in their body, and get it early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="95968930-93ef-44bd-a8b0-63e9f2648fe3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Qvin’s standing kit and Q-pad for blood sample collection.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Qvin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But only if Qvin’s pads are able to test a menstrual blood sample for more conditions than diabetes. It is selling its pad system to research institutions and large healthcare companies to encourage the development of more tests, including for endometriosis, and looking into getting additional FDA approvals of its own, like a test for high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV), which is linked to cervical cancer and currently screened for with a Pap smear, and another for various sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Indeed, it has &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qvin-menstrual-blood-diagnostic-device-receives-fda-approval-in-thailand-301736890.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;already secured approval in Thailand&lt;/a&gt; for the former. A big advantage of the pad over tampons or cups is it is the most widely used menstrual product worldwide, says Naseri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kate Clancy is a biological anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she is using period blood to study endometriosis lesions, as well as author of the book Period,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which investigates the overlooked science of menstruation&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She has watched with interest as the field unfolds. Some of what she sees, she likes – including using period blood to test for endometriosis. “Conditions that actually affect the uterus I absolutely see a use case; it totally makes sense,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But she is skeptical of menstrual blood testing where a standard blood test already exists, such as A1C for diabetes or hormone testing to assess reproductive health. “Why wait until a person menstruates?” she says, adding that if an argument for the menstrual blood tests is that they increase women’s access to healthcare, the real answer lies in addressing the societal issues that limit access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She also raises a broader concern: while diagnostic tests provide clear answers, definitively confirming or ruling out conditions, a wave of new menstrual blood-based screening tests – which might, for instance, flag signs of cancer or STIs in healthy populations – could end up being burdensome, adding extra steps to confirm results and potentially needless anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And she urges caution around menstrual blood tests marketed more for health and wellness rather than medical purposes. Because they are not making medical claims, they are often less regulated and may sell insights about hormone balance or vitamin levels that have not been clinically validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are a ways from good translational work,” Clancy says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-potential-stem-cell-source" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A potential stem cell source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is a “medical miracle” that happens once a month in women’s bodies, when the endometrial lining that is shed during menstruation regenerates, thickening explosively as new blood vessels sprout from existing ones, says Thomas Ichim, a scientist and biotech entrepreneur who co-authored &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-5-57" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 2007 paper&lt;/a&gt; on the discovery of stem cells in menstrual blood. It is stem cells in the endometrium – some of which slough off into period blood – that drive that process. “It’s logical to think that you can use those cells to stimulate blood vessel production in somebody else,” Ichim says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, menstrual fluid does not just have diagnostic and screening potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-p6qh0t"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Menstrual effluent is an intriguing stem cell source … but we are not far enough along to really say more than that&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The big promise of stem cells is that one day they will be used by doctors to regenerate damaged tissue.

And when they were first discovered in menstrual blood, a flurry of research began exploring applications for treating gynaecological disorders, among other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Theoretically, menstrual blood could be a plentiful source of stem cells: donors could give by menstrual cup instead of undergoing an invasive biopsy to harvest them from bone marrow, as is practice now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But little of the initial increase in research ever advanced; according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.957164" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one recent estimate&lt;/a&gt;, just 0.25% of the adult stem cell research in recent years has involved menstrual blood-derived stem cells. Without a solid understanding of their basic utility, these stem cells are likely decades away from yielding therapies, says Brendan Harley, a tissue engineer also at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (he and Clancy are married).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="93bc462f-e319-4a73-bc8d-03227b8390d6" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Blokes cringe if you talk about it in the pub,’ says researcher Caroline Gargett. ‘[But] menstrual fluid has so much potential.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Andrew Brookes/Getty Images/Image Source&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Menstrual effluent is an intriguing stem cell source … but we are not far enough along to really say more than that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fundamental work, he believes, is being held back in the US by the lack of funding and that ick factor– that anything related to menstrual blood is seen as dirty. “I think it has permeated folk’s thinking about using it for regenerative medicine,” Harley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2004, researcher Caroline Gargett &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.103.024109" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published her discovery&lt;/a&gt; of stem cells in the human endometrium, setting the scene for their later discovery in menstrual blood. These days Gargett, who works at the Hudson Institute of Medical Research in Australia, uses stem cells from the endometrium in her own work: helping treat pelvic organ prolapse. She says they have greater regenerative potential and longer lived effects than those in menstrual blood, though getting them requires invasive endometrial biopsy. “A lot of people have just gone, ‘well let’s try,’ with stem cells in period blood, without really understanding” the intricacies, she says. (For instance, menstrual blood contains a mixture of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;true stem cells and stem cell-like cells, making it more challenging to isolate a pure, reliable sample.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet she envisions an alternative use for menstrual blood. She would like to grow tiny, personalized models of the uterine lining for women with endometriosis, so-called “organoids”, from the fragments of endometrial tissue in their period blood. Each woman&lt;strong&gt;’&lt;/strong&gt;s “miniorgan” would be stored in a ‘menstrual fluid biobank’ and used to test how they respond to different drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Blokes cringe if you talk about it in the pub,” Gargett says. “[But] menstrual fluid has so much potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="264ed676-e624-4893-9fd5-3f1df451da99" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="element element--richLink element-richLink dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":60,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Stained panties, male guards and no privacy: what it’s like to have your period in prison","elementId":"264ed676-e624-4893-9fd5-3f1df451da99","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/prison-period"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":18,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Funding remains the biggest hurdle for period blood testing, say those in the field. While NGJ and Qvin, the Bay Area companies, have bagged roughly $20m in funding each since their inception over a decade ago, it is a small sum compared with vast amounts of cash sloshing around in Silicon Valley. The Rose project has no funding in place for the work of developing a better menstrual cup. Burns has had to pause development on her test for endometriosis because it is unfunded. Gargett has not yet secured funding for her biobank, though she continues to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a spot of good news, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) launched a $10m &lt;a href="https://cgr.mit.edu/2025/07/31/mit-launches-moonshot-for-menstruation-science/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menstruation science initiative&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “This is frontier science,” says Linda Griffith, director of MIT’s center for gynaepathology research and the initiative’s leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, NGJ wants to keep the flow of blood incoming: as the startup’s CEO Tariyal, not one to miss an opportunity, says: “If you’re thinking about how you can contribute, give us your tampon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNRGMzUG92YlFaYlNKME5yb0RzTE1OS29BVGl4cno2Zmhqakl6UXFfMGJJb2cyZjdJdU93STdwb1k1SE9RaWVhd0tvbDhkMW9TSzdzUVZxMF9wdG94MzBJUmVwRnNIQXZ6R1BNNUY1akpfZDlyTnlwRDc4b3JCMHZnM1Q0bTF2Zi01MFRBMW8tcXRvOWRFTTJWOEpoUWdnQWQ5emR4aC1iMFRlY0U</guid></item><item><title>灰发可能是身体避免致命癌症的方式- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/gray-hair-might-be-the-bodys-way-of-avoiding-a-deadly-cancer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Gray hair is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, according to a new study by researchers in Japan, the presence of gray hair may be a good sign that your body is naturally protecting itself from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="178695" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of mouse experiments suggests we've evolved to let go of cells that are at risk of generating tumors at the expense of a little color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our cells are routinely subjected to a barrage of 'genotoxic insults,' or DNA damage wrought by a wide variety of environmental factors. Skin cells bear the brunt of many such affronts, given their role in helping buffer our internal organs from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-stress-really-turn-your-hair-gray"&gt;Does Stress Really Turn Your Hair Gray?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DNA damage can contribute to cell aging as well as to the development of cancer, although the specific genotoxins, signals, and cellular mechanisms involved with the physical signs of aging remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study focuses specifically on melanoma, a type of cancer predominantly found in the skin, where it originates in melanocytes – specialized skin cells that generate melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanocytes themselves arise from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="178695" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; (McSCs) located within the hair follicles of mammalian skin, where they maintain skin and hair pigmentation via regular regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice, the researchers profiled the expressions of the tissue's genes to uncover the fates of the McSCs subjected to various kinds of DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of damage known as a double-strand break, in which both strands in the DNA's double helix are severed, the researchers identified a specific response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The McSCs irreversibly differentiated and disappeared, resulting in the mouse's hair turning gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178766" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178766" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/000011891.jpg" alt="Genotoxic stress and melanocyte stem cell fate" class="size-full wp-image-178766" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/000011891.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/000011891-600x250.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178766" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Under cytotoxic genotoxin exposure, such as X-ray irradiation, McSC self-renewal is impaired, leading to depletion and hair graying. In homeostasis, McSCs maintain self-renewal and pigment balance. Carcinogenic genotoxins, however, promote KIT signaling and alter arachidonic acid metabolism, triggering melanoma.

Researchers treated the skin of mice with ultraviolet B (UVB) light and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), a potent carcinogen often used to induce tumor growth in laboratory research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exposed to these carcinogens, McSCs bypassed the differentiation process that occurred after double-strand breaks, even if the cells had suffered DNA damage, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the general benefits of resilience, there is also something to be said for knowing when to quit. For McSCs, bowing out in response to DNA damage may be worth the loss of hair color if it means a lower risk of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When exposed to UVB or DMBA, melanocyte stem cells retained their self-renewal abilities and continued to clone themselves, the researchers report. This effect is supported by a cytokine called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell_factor"&gt;stem cell factor&lt;/a&gt; (SCF), which is involved with guiding the melanocytes to their proper place in the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secreted in the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="178695" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt;'s local microenvironment, SCF also suppresses seno-differentiation. Instead of containing DNA damage, this increases the risk of tumors developing by encouraging compromised McSCs to carry on.&lt;br&gt;

Graying is a result of seno-differentiation, a protective pathway that helps the body respond to genotoxic stress by eliminating potentially dangerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this process doesn't take place, however, the resulting survival and proliferation of damaged McSCs may favor melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research will be needed to shed light on the mechanisms involved and to investigate corresponding phenomena in humans, but this already represents a significant leap in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this insight into the molecular circuits governing McSCs' divergent fates, the study presents a model to help explain key details about the relationship between tissue aging and cancer, the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            Monday marks a full year of continuous measles transmission in Canada, a milestone that’s poised to set the country back decades on a global health commitment. Ongoing transmission in the United States puts it among a group of countries that also face scrutiny from international leaders and are at risk of a similar fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00043b6nvco5jrkq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All of the World Health Organization’s regions have committed to eliminate measles by 2030, defined by the absence of local virus transmission for any period longer than 12 months. Canada achieved this goal in 1998, but falling vaccination rates set the stage for cases to grow into a massive — and ongoing — outbreak, putting the country and region at risk of losing elimination status.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00053b6nbvdfu432@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In early November, the Pan American Health Organization, a regional WHO office, will convene an annual meeting of its Measles and Rubella Elimination Regional Monitoring and Re-Verification Commission to formally determine the status of measles elimination across the region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00063b6n97e6vukp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A country is no longer considered to be measles free if the virus returns and transmission is sustained continuously for more than a year,” WHO said in a statement. “There are no formal consequences of losing measles elimination status, however having measles again as an endemic disease will have a profound negative impact on communities, including preventable deaths among some of the most vulnerable populations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00073b6ntqf0iby2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Countries that lose elimination status will be asked to submit a corrective action plan, which may include efforts focused on intensified vaccination activities, strengthened surveillance and rapid outbreak response.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh7w1j1900033b6nl2xnuzdd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2016, the Americas became the first and only region to effectively eliminate measles by ending local spread. Venezuela and Brazil have both lost elimination status since then, only recently becoming reverified after years of “extensive vaccination, surveillance, and rapid response efforts,” PAHO said. The region as a whole regained elimination status last year, but it is under threat again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00083b6ndlpsxbqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            International travel was the initial source of the outbreak that started in Canada in October 2024, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. But the country has now had thousands of cases across 10 jurisdictions, including hundreds of hospitalizations and two deaths in infants who were born prematurely with infections they contracted before birth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd00093b6np5gwzrfw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canada has tallied more than 5,000 cases this year, more than twice as many as the country has recorded in the past 25 years combined. All but 157 cases have been associated with the outbreak, and about 90% of all cases have been among people who are unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000a3b6nt77inqof@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Immunization coverage across the Region is insufficient to stop outbreaks from occurring, and also hides pockets within countries that have even lower coverage. The Region needs to sustain high coverage, quality surveillance and rapid response at all times,” WHO said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh7wkjdv00093b6n8ini9cyt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canadian leaders are “more consistent” in their support of vaccination than American leaders, said Dr. Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist and professor in the Department of Medicine at McMaster University in Ontario. National surveys suggest that the vast majority of parents still support childhood vaccinations, she said, but health care disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic, disinformation and misinformation and liberal exemption rules in some provinces have created vulnerabilities.

            The potential to lose elimination status “highlights the severity of the measles outbreak,” Bowdish said. “If you look at the other countries that also have circulating measles, you see that they are countries without strong public health like Canada and they are countries that have been torn apart by war or civil unrest. It is an eye-opener about how you need to have constant vigilance and consistent support for public health in order to fight infectious disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000b3b6nyvncod2w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canada’s national health agency says it is in regular communication with the Pan American Health Organization about the progress of the outbreak and efforts to contain it. The outbreak has slowed in recent weeks, the agency says, but there were still 30 new cases reported in the latest week of data available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000c3b6nn6pihtj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And Canada isn’t the only country posing a risk to the region. Six others — including the US and Mexico — have active measles transmission situations that will be discussed at the PAHO commission meeting. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/politics/trump-executive-action-world-health-organization-withdrawal"&gt;withdraw the US from WHO,&lt;/a&gt; but PAHO says that it expects US officials – both from the CDC and the National Sustainability Commission – to attend the commission meeting on measles elimination next month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000d3b6n7qnc7ng0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In August, local health officials declared that an outbreak centered in West Texas — one of the largest and deadliest in decades — &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/18/health/texas-measles-outbreak-declared-over"&gt;had ended&lt;/a&gt;. The outbreak caused 762 cases over the course of about seven months, according to data from the state health department; neighboring New Mexico also reported 100 cases this year associated with the outbreak. Three people died: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000e3b6nnildtpmo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But measles counts continue to grow in the US, and ongoing outbreaks in multiple states — including one on the border of Arizona and Utah and one in South Carolina — are being investigated for possible connections to the Texas outbreak. If links are confirmed and cases continue to spread into January, the US will have also lost its claim to the measles elimination status that it earned in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000f3b6nvwnuaevm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the elimination of measles an &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;historic achievement&lt;/a&gt;, credited to a “highly effective vaccination program” in the US and better measles control across the Americas region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000g3b6nfx03lnw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been declining in the US and Canada for years, with notable dips after the Covid-19 pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000h3b6nwwjgz9j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last school year marked the fifth year in a row that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;MMR coverage among kindergartners in the US&lt;/a&gt; had been below the federal target of 95%, a benchmark needed to prevent spread of the highly contagious disease. And in Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization-vaccines/vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from six jurisdictions shows that the share of 2-year-olds who had received at least one MMR dose fell from nearly 90% in 2019 to less than 83% in 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000i3b6niw2q2c3u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In South Carolina, there have been at least 22 cases associated with an outbreak in the upstate region, and more than 100 unvaccinated children were quarantined for weeks after a measles exposure at school. The state health department sent a mobile health unit to the area to offer free MMR vaccination, but uptake has been less than leaders had hoped: Only 21 people have utilized the resource over the past week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000j3b6njqxe4zyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although we are pleased that 21 people have chosen to receive the vaccine, the noted increase is largely attributed to adults, which contributes less to herd immunity in school populations where we have seen the greatest spread so far during this outbreak,” ​Louis Eubank, director of the state health department’s Bureau of Emergency Preparedness and Response, said in an email. “We remain hopeful that more parents of unvaccinated children will make an informed decision to take advantage of this opportunity to protect their children from a serious illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000k3b6nalowdwdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles outbreak along the state line between Arizona and Utah has grown to more than 100 cases since mid-August, spreading largely in unvaccinated communities. Last school year, nearly 1 in 5 kindergartners in the Southwest district of Utah where the outbreak is growing were missing documentation of having received the MMR vaccine — more than any other region and twice as high as the state average.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000l3b6nfyw1o2hn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles has spread across the country and locally, public health officials in Utah report a rise in vaccinations: 32% more MMR vaccinations statewide between March and September than in the same period last year. But vaccinations increased only half as much in the Southwest district — up 16% year-over-year — contributing to widening disparities in coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000m3b6nlspuqguq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers from McMaster University say that &lt;a href="https://news.mcmaster.ca/analysis-vaccine-hesitancy-how-social-and-technological-issues-converged-to-spawn-mistrust/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt; is fueled by a “complex blend of personal, social and environmental factors.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000n3b6nidz0knth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Individual behaviors are influenced by community, both in physical proximity and through social media, they said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh5d8fkd000o3b6n5dqzn4p2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Such dynamics can also result in localized pockets of under-vaccination that benefit the unprotected through herd immunity, but also risk unvaccinated groups becoming high-risk clusters if that protection deteriorates,” they wrote in a recent analysis published in The Conversation. ”The COVID-19 pandemic has proven how damaging misinformation, disinformation, information voids and information gaps can be to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(24)00031-8" target="_blank"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt;, including immunization coverage and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-17430-6" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine hesitancy&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

But the work of the committee isn’t done only by the independent advisers; it is supported by CDC staff and outside experts on working groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC staff provide logistical support and subject-matter expertise, and they make sure the committee follows rules and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The entire department is now “gone”, Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said last week at a press conference with Defend America Action. Only a designated federal official for the group remains, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“CDC scientists are being held hostage by Robert F Kennedy Jr.,” Daskalakis added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With the ACIP staff, “a lot of what they do is logistics,” said Kevin Ault, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Western Michigan University Homer Stryker MD School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In recent meetings, “you’ve kind of seen that fall apart”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some presentations weren’t available for the most recent meeting, and several Zoom links and microphones weren’t working. The language of the votes wasn’t distributed to the public or apparently to the advisers ahead of time, with one committee member objecting to a vote because of the lack of information. With the support staff now gone, such delays and mistakes may worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not just scientists and staff within the agency feeling the effects of terminations and shakeups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The ACIP’s working groups are often composed of subject experts, local health department officials, and representatives from medical groups in addition to CDC employees. There are usually eight to ten working groups at a given time focusing on pathogens like influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human papillomavirus (HPV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We usually do the very boring job of slogging through the data and deciding what information is most important to present at the public meeting,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most working groups have not met in at least six months. Ault was in a meeting for the working group on RSV in June when the news broke that all 17 advisers on the ACIP – some of whom were leading the session – were being fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“They weren’t informed ahead of time. It was in the Wall Street Journal and somebody happened to be on the call and said, ‘Hey, did you guys know you just got fired?’” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since then, Ault has attended no meetings and received little word from staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The only communication I’ve gotten has been usually the day of a scheduled meeting – that it’s been canceled. Other than that, I’ve not gotten much communication at all,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ault was an ACIP member from 2018 to 2022. He has been on the flu working group on and off since the flu pandemic of 2009, and he’s chair of the scheduling committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Most of them have not met in six months or more,” Ault said. “It’s been very fragmented and haphazard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The flu recommendations were published in August despite no meeting of the working group, which meant experts and medical groups had no input on the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Representatives from some groups received an unsigned email in August saying their input was no longer needed. The disinvited groups included the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Other representatives, including from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), haven’t received word on whether they are still participating in the working groups, Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One apparent exception to the pause on working groups is the new Covid vaccine group headed by Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and one of the new vaccine advisers. It’s not clear who is on the Covid committee and whether they are following the usual processes for working groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Working group members have presented data at ACIP meetings since the shakeup. But they’ve been “sidelined”, Daskalakis said. “They’re only, in effect, providing data that frankly is being just criticized and ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A meeting planned for October has been rescheduled “TBD”, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the ACIP website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A vaccine schedule should be published by the CDC by 1 January, and Vaccines for Children – a program that provides vaccines to 52% of children in the US – depends on that schedule, Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Normally, the schedule would have been published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), but that publication is temporarily closed during the government shutdown. And the schedule would’ve been discussed at the October meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“All the vaccines for children and to some extent adults are at risk if that job does not get done in the next two and a half months,” Ault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Gutting the committee also means promising new vaccines in the late stages of clinical trials may never be recommended, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know what the future holds for new vaccines that are on the near horizon. The path forward just seems very murky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;With the termination of ACIP staff, “it’s like the operating system for the advisory committee is gone”, Daskalakis said. “The hardware is there, the software is there” – but there’s no way to make the system run, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The RIFs, which also affected departments like human resources, could limit what happens with the committee in the future, Debra Houry, former chief medical officer for the CDC, said at the same press conference with Daskalakis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If they want to add any new members, HR is gone. The entire HR for CDC is gone. That’s who brings on the special government employees and new FACA [Federal Advisory Committee Act] members,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The ethics office was also entirely let go. If “these folks have a baseline conflict of interest, we’ll never know, because they’re not going to be assessed anymore by the ethics office”, Daskalakis said. “That’s another pretty significant red flag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQYXFKSWdEdDEwQ3E1QktaYktsTWxab3JBRVpSel9vdS1EanFkS1NCeHJqa3lId01tYi1STlNkVkFjLThXb05lQ0tWUmdDUVZXZDREemVXUlRvOTdpQ1hvaWsxN0Y2QXk5Nl9obGNiX3pCcWFRa2hXdkhfOXZxS3NYZjVUY18</guid></item><item><title>我们询问了医生您需要服用镁多长时间才能睡得更好- Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/magnesium-consistency-sleep-11834843</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is a go-to supplement for better sleep, but there is confusion around how long you need to take it to see results.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not like you can take it and your magnesium levels will be high immediately. Trials on the effects of using magnesium range from about 20 days to eight weeks, so you can expect to see results within that timeframe if you take it daily.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Melatonin is released from your pineal gland and helps you fall asleep—it directly impacts that. Magnesium supplements raise the magnesium levels overall, which helps you feel more relaxed and less stressed once your levels are in a healthy range. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, the mechanisms aren't as direct as those of melatonin, which literally acts on the receptors to help you fall asleep.

    &lt;p&gt;Every few months, a new “miracle cure” for cancer trends on social media. From superfoods and supplements to extreme diets, the promises are always bold – and almost always misleading. The latest claim suggests that a 21-day water fast can “starve” cancer cells and trigger the body to heal itself. It sounds simple, even empowering: stop eating and your body will do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But biology is rarely that simple. Cancer &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cancer-14"&gt;is not a single disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/metabolism-7671"&gt;and metabolism&lt;/a&gt; does not switch neatly between “sick” and “healthy.” &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/fasting-24583"&gt;While fasting&lt;/a&gt; can affect how our cells use energy, there is no scientific evidence that it can eradicate tumours. In fact, prolonged fasting can be dangerous, especially for people already weakened by cancer or its treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While fasting can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9530862/"&gt;influence metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/346666-fasting-as-cancer-treatment-myth-or-breakthrough-in-oncology#!/"&gt;immunity&lt;/a&gt; and some aspects of &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-reveals-fasting-benefits-and-downside-0821"&gt;cell growth&lt;/a&gt;, there is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37377031/"&gt;no credible evidence&lt;/a&gt; that prolonged water fasting can treat or cure cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting, in its many forms – from intermittent fasting to short-term calorie restriction – has been shown in laboratory studies to influence how cells repair themselves and manage energy. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07840-z"&gt;2024 research shows&lt;/a&gt; that fasting temporarily suppresses intestinal stem cell activity, followed by a powerful regenerative phase once food is reintroduced. This rebound in stem cell growth is driven by a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8281972/"&gt;pathway known as mTOR&lt;/a&gt;, which promotes protein synthesis and cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Some celebrities and influencers claim that water fasting could help&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/glass-water-plate-knife-fork-isolated-1341438452"&gt;Artfilmphoto/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this regeneration helps tissues recover, it can also create a vulnerable window in which harmful mutations may occur more easily, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-023-01608-z"&gt;raising the risk&lt;/a&gt; of tumour formation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8754590/"&gt;Most research&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35848874/"&gt;fasting’s effects&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36441383/"&gt;focused on intermittent or short fasts&lt;/a&gt; lasting between 12 and 72 hours, not on extreme water-only fasts that continue for weeks. A 21-day water fast, as promoted in some wellness circles, carries serious risks. Extended fasting can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, dangerously low blood pressure and muscle loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer itself often leads to malnutrition, and fasting can accelerate wasting (&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-023-00734-5"&gt;cachexia&lt;/a&gt;), weaken the immune system and increase susceptibility to infection. Many cancer patients are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/chemotherapy-can-be-a-challenging-treatment-heres-how-to-deal-with-some-of-the-side-effects-238940"&gt;undergoing chemotherapies&lt;/a&gt; that require adequate nutrition to maintain organ function and safely metabolise drugs. Combining these treatments with prolonged fasting can amplify toxicity, delay recovery and worsen fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33153820/"&gt;ongoing clinical studies&lt;/a&gt; into short fasting or fasting-mimicking diets before chemotherapy, but these are medically supervised, typically lasting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36970110/"&gt;less than 48 hours&lt;/a&gt; and carefully monitored for safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting continues to intrigue scientists because it activates ancient survival mechanisms. During food scarcity, the body triggers processes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10509423/"&gt;such as autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, where cells &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30172870/"&gt;recycle damaged components&lt;/a&gt;. This process can reduce inflammation and improve metabolic health in animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in cancer, the story is far more complex. Cancer cells are resourceful. They can adapt to fasting by finding alternative fuel sources, sometimes outcompeting healthy cells under nutrient stress. Long periods without nutrition can also weaken immune cells that normally detect and attack tumours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07840-z"&gt;2024 fasting study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates this duality. Fasting may reset metabolism, but refeeding rapidly activates growth pathways such as mTOR. In healthy cells, this helps repair tissues. In cells already carrying DNA damage or early mutations, it can encourage &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6938162/"&gt;malignant progression&lt;/a&gt;. This makes fasting a complex biological stress factor rather than a harmless or therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The ‘detox’ myth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of fasting’s popular appeal comes from the myth of “&lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/the-facts-behind-4-detox-myths-should-you-detox-your-body.h00-159385890.html"&gt;detoxification&lt;/a&gt;”: the belief that abstaining from food “cleanses” the body. In reality, organs such as the liver, kidneys and lymphatic system already perform this task continuously. Cancer is not caused by accumulated “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/jul/31/can-you-detox-body-cleanse-health-myth-science"&gt;toxins&lt;/a&gt;” that can be flushed out. It develops through genetic changes that cause uncontrolled cell growth. No research has shown that fasting can eliminate cancer cells or shrink tumours in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Water fasts won’t ‘detox’ your body.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/spa-happy-friends-cheers-drink-luxury-2286384745"&gt;PeopleImages/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12035504/"&gt;Controlled studies&lt;/a&gt; have observed only short-term metabolic shifts that may influence inflammation or insulin signalling. These effects could help reduce long-term risk factors for chronic disease, but they do not reverse cancer once it has developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The promise and limits of metabolic research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is scientific interest in how metabolism affects cancer. Researchers are exploring whether targeted &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35047448/"&gt;calorie restriction&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37242217/"&gt;ketogenic diets&lt;/a&gt; could make tumour cells more sensitive to treatment while protecting healthy ones. These studies are still in early stages and focus on precision, not deprivation. None involve starving the body of all nutrients for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15178153/cancer-treatment-chemotherapy-water-fasting.html"&gt;Sensational claims&lt;/a&gt; blur the line between hypothesis and proof, giving vulnerable patients false hope by cherry-picking facts, mentioning fasting’s role in cell repair while omitting the crucial detail that most findings come from animal models, not human trials. For someone undergoing cancer treatment, attempting an unsupervised extreme fast could delay essential care, worsen side effects, or even put their life at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting is a physiological stressor. In small, controlled doses, it can trigger adaptive processes that benefit health. In excess, especially during illness, it can cause harm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 21-day water fast is neither a plausible nor a safe cancer treatment. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01641-0"&gt;Research into fasting&lt;/a&gt; helps us understand how cells respond to nutrition and stress, but that knowledge underscores fasting’s complexity rather than supports it as therapy. While balanced nutrition, hydration, regular physical activity and adequate sleep can all support resilience &lt;a href="https://oncodaily.com/blog/155224"&gt;during cancer therapy&lt;/a&gt;, none replace medical treatments designed to target tumour biology. Cancer care requires targeted, evidence-based treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting research is helping us understand the deep connections between metabolism and disease, but that is very different from curing cancer with a glass of water and willpower. It is understandable that people want control when facing something as frightening as cancer. The search for alternatives often comes from fear, frustration or a wish to avoid painful treatments. But hope should never rest on misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

She’s a retired, but still feisty, judge who now works as a mediator. And while she wasn’t much of an exerciser when I was growing up in Philadelphia, she now considers herself a “geriatric jock.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do &lt;a class="link" href="https://tools.silversneakers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Silver Sneakers&lt;/a&gt; on Zoom almost every day,” she boasted of her online fitness routine. “Let’s see what they have to show me here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thegymvenice.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Gym Venice &lt;/a&gt;specializes in training bodies over 40-years-old, which have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-10-09/how-to-strength-train-aging-avoid-injury"&gt;different needs&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to strength training, than younger exercisers, says owner Kris Herbert. For starters, older bodies — especially after years of a sedentary lifestyle — are more susceptible to injuries. Conditions such as osteoporosis and arthritis can lead to weakened muscles, fragile bones and unstable joints as well as balance issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herbert’s gym isn’t the only locale training adults in midlife and beyond. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.stillgotitfitness.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Still Got It Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, in Lomita, and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.q4-active.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Q4 Active&lt;/a&gt;, in Woodland Hills, both train exercisers over 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Times staff writer Deborah Vankin, right, and her mother, Sandra Mazer Moss, undergo an “ability test” at the Gym Venice. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Catherine Dzilenski / For The Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The niche approach is for good reason. As we age, we also lose muscle mass — as much as &lt;a class="link" href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2025/04/slowing-sarcopenia" target="_blank"&gt;3% to 5% per decade&lt;/a&gt; after age 30, according to the National Institutes of Health — and our metabolism slows, which can lead to weight gain. When strength training later in life, more attention must be paid to building strength around the joints, Herbert says, and strengthening the posterior, or back, chain of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the most part, the clientele here has very sedentary jobs sitting at desks and they [can] get &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2025-01-21/easy-exercises-help-desk-jobs-aches-pains"&gt;tech neck&lt;/a&gt; and their back and posture can get compromised, causing lower back pain,” he says. “So here, it’s all about &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/lifestyle/story/2024-11-12/slow-motion-strength-training-studios-los-angeles"&gt;building skeletal muscle mass&lt;/a&gt; — which helps with metabolism, bone density, regulating hormones, everything — and getting your back and posture strong so you can support yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cool. I’m in!” my mom said. She was wearing her favorite T-shirt, picturing &lt;a class="link" href="https://rosietheriveter.org/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTT2TW2SFu48A_dvkTtK0y_Fr5x2S2kHrIzHC8igqEMXzJjyOe" target="_blank"&gt;Rosie the Riveter&lt;/a&gt; and the text “Nevertheless, she persisted.” “Where do we start?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former guitar shop on Venice Boulevard  — with its bow truss ceiling, exposed wood beams and a polished concrete floor — limits attendance to five clients and their trainers at any given time, so that the environment is calm and visitors can better focus on their workouts — no big-box gym sound system blasting hip-hop, just background chit-chat and the occasional sound of clanking metal from barbells. 95% of the gym’s clientele is between the ages of 40 and 65, with a few clients in their 70s and 80s and several teenagers who come in to work out with their parents. The gym’s trainers — there are seven on staff — are mentored by Herbert, 42, and gym manager Ed Gemdjian, 45. They’re taught how to train older bodies and modify movements when clients have limitations. Then they shadow other trainers before working  one-on-one with clients. Gemdjian also holds weekly workshops on various aspects of training older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have to have an understanding of our specialized equipment,” Herbert says of his trainers, “as well as how to meet clients where they are — which could mean limited mobility or joint issues — to safely and properly put them through a workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Herbert explained all this, my mom nodded enthusiastically. She has both osteoporosis and arthritis and is concerned about her bone density. She’s also had two hip replacements. But after Herbert’s explanation of how his trainers work with clients, she felt she was in good hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He seems to know his stuff,” she said, “especially about issues that women face as they age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our mother-daughter session began as any new member’s would: with a full body assessment followed by mobility and ability tests so that Herbert could design a customized training program for each of us. He had us step on a body composition scanner, which looked like a slender scale. After wiping off our palms and soles (to increase conductivity), we stepped onto it and waited about a minute. Then it printed out a sheet of charts and graphs. It gave us a detailed &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5771660/" target="_blank"&gt;muscle-fat analysis,&lt;/a&gt; including our total skeletal muscle mass in pounds, our basal metabolic rate (the number of calories we burn at rest), our overall body fat percentage as well as a “segmental fat analysis” that broke down our fat percentage across each arm, leg and on our trunk. Most importantly, it showed our visceral fat level, which means the fat around our organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is huge for disease prevention,” Herbert says. “We’re trying to keep that low.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body assessment was intimidating at first — I mean, who really wants to know the exact percentage of fat on their belly? But my mom found the information empowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, like, you’d design a special program especially for me?” she said, almost teary-eyed. (I explained that all trainers do that, whether the client is over 40 or not. But still, she was impressed with Herbert and sang the gym’s praises as we moved into the next testing phase.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I lived here, I could track my progress on the body scanner week to week,” she said, trailing behind Herbert. “I love that!” (Mom’s enthusiastic.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mobility test included our laying on a floor mat while Herbert guided us in doing three lower extremity stretches — a spinal twist, for example — followed by three upper body stretches, such as a shoulder raise, with light bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that we did the ability test, gauging how we performed different compound movements — meaning multi-joint movements using major muscle groups — on machines or with hand-held weights, cables or bars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

  &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Catherine Dzilenski / For The Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to make sure our clients can do the movements with full range of motion, pain-free,” Herbert says. “That’s how we can test what you can and cannot do at the gym, so that we can create a program for you. Then we bullet proof your back — make you strong for everyday things, like carrying groceries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom was down: “Count me in,” she said (a favorite phrase), while checking out her form — and her freshly highlighted hair — in the mirror as she did a bicep curl with a 5-pound weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gym also features special equipment that caters to older bodies. Many of the weight machines are designed to be lower impact, for example, and therefore kinder on the joints. The bench pad used is 4 inches wider than a standard bench pad, eliminating shoulder overhang and protecting the chest and shoulders. They also use “specialty bars” to avoid impact on the shoulders. “So you can push yourself safely, harder,” Herbert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He walked us over to a hunk of metal glistening by the window. It looked like a medieval torture device … or something you’d see at &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2025-07-27/comic-con-2025-hall-h"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a belt squat machine,” Herbert explained, slipping the padded belt around his waist. “It’s for people with shoulder impingement or spinal compression issues. It takes all the compression off your spine and allows you to perform a squat under resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he pointed to another piece of equipment. “That’s a bilateral leg press,” he said. “You can work one leg at a time if you have imbalances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mom watched, eyes wide with possibility, as if Herbert were showing her a swanky vacation timeshare in Maui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I could &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;that,” she said. “This place, for someone like me — I have two bionic hips, you know — it feels like a safe space to try something and initially fail, but then with hard work and encouragement eventually be able to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her enthusiasm, I doubted my mom would join the Gym Venice if she lived in Los Angeles. The gym does offer a $99 weeklong trial that includes a body composition scan, mobility-ability tests and three personal training sessions. But the per-session rate after that ranges from $140 to $175 — which is steep by anyone’s measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was surprised, however, when I asked my mom about it later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center-expanded&gt;&lt;figure class="figure m-0"&gt;

The Founder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Sol Kennedy used&lt;/span&gt; to ask his assistant to read the messages his ex-wife sent him. After the couple separated in 2020, Kennedy says, he found their communications “tough.” An email, or a stream of them, would arrive—stuff about their two kids mixed with unrelated emotional wallops—and his day would be ruined trying to reply. Kennedy, a serial tech founder and investor in Silicon Valley, was in therapy at the time. But outside weekly sessions, he felt the need for real-time support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;After the couple’s divorce, their communications shifted to a platform called &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-emotional-intelligence/"&gt;OurFamilyWizard&lt;/a&gt;, used by hundreds of thousands of parents in the United States and abroad to exchange messages, share calendars, track expenses. (OFW keeps a time-stamped, court-admissible record of everything.) Kennedy paid extra for an add-on called ToneMeter, which OFW touted at the time as “emotional spellcheck.” As you drafted a message, its software would conduct a basic sentiment analysis, flagging language that could be “concerning,” “aggressive,” “upsetting,” “demeaning,” and so on. But there was a problem, Kennedy says: His co-parent didn’t seem to be using &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; ToneMeter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe ejayGs callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Kennedy, ever the early adopter, had been experimenting with ChatGPT to “cocreate” bedtime stories with his kids. Now he turned to it for advice on communications with his ex. He was wowed—and he wasn’t the first. Across Reddit and other internet forums, people with difficult exes, family members, and coworkers were posting with shock about the seemingly excellent guidance, and the precious emotional validation, a chatbot could provide. Here was a machine that could tell you, with no apparent agenda, that you were not the crazy one. Here was a counselor that would patiently hold your hand, 24 hours a day, as you waded through any amount of bullshit. “A scalable solution” to supplement therapy, as Kennedy puts it. Finally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But fresh out of the box, ChatGPT was too talkative for Kennedy’s needs, he says—and much too apologetic. He would feed it tough messages, and it would recommend replying (in many more sentences than necessary) &lt;em&gt;I’m sorry, please forgive me, I’ll do better&lt;/em&gt;. Having no self, it had no self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Kennedy wanted a chatbot with “spine,” and he thought that if he built it, a lot of other co-parents might want it too. As he saw it, AI could help them at each stage of their communications: It could filter emotionally triggering language out of incoming messages and summarize just the facts. It could suggest appropriate responses. It could coach users toward “a better way,” Kennedy says. So he founded a company and started developing an app. He called it BestInterest, after the standard that courts often use for custody decisions—the “best interest” of the child or children. He would take those off-the-shelf OpenAI models and give them spine with his own prompts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Estranged partners end up fighting horribly for any number of reasons, of course. For many, perhaps even most, things cool down after enough months have gone by, and a tool like BestInterest might not be useful long-term. But when a certain kind of personality is in the mix—call it “high-conflict,” “narcissistic,” “controlling,” “toxic,” whatever synonym for “crazy-making” you tend to see cross your internet feed—the fighting about the kids, at least from one side, never stops. Kennedy wanted his chatbot to stand up to these people, so he turned to the one they may hate most: Ramani Durvasula, a Los Angeles–based clinical psychologist who specializes in how narcissism shapes relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBDN0FxVTBFOWo2SGk3aF9Xa0hGeG1qQXNZNHh1bWhpSWo0ZDVOMWNxeFRaLVlnWG82TmNOZ0xEZ0NDajhtUndfeVdzSFRYeThzeDZGTTZSQ0ZPV0txWHFRZjU4X1JVRkxWTU9Nd1UwVkhGMFN1YkpvSA</guid></item><item><title>在房主粗心大意的错误之后，邻居们遭受了无情的洪水： “残酷的不法行为” -雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/neighbors-suffer-relentless-flooding-homeowners-100000968.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A Florida neighborhood has been subjected to recurring flooding after one of its residents decided to plug a stormwater pipe that ran through their property with concrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/atrocious-wrongdoing-florida-neighborhood-floods-080000538.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL2Z1Y2tIT0EvY29tbWVudHMvMWVrZnlrOS9ob2FfdnNfa2FyZW5fY29tbXVuaXR5X2xvc2VzLw&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKdJ-f3XVKUgTwJoFSMMCAhZl8uJ1WafO31P3LKjue_wK_7qQFh6neXFBBGapRbfqnjITF-0FHWgBnjeMLy0j5V0FMruoYPSxVdbEzdV0euYS3UyGy0z9gC40WSBPnPZ-yncj9Z4sdBxPfOolRJNMuHUcNzfBgGFlIm6Pm3TIlgt&amp;amp;guccounter=2" data-ylk="slk:Orlando Sentinel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Orlando Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, residents of the Shadowbay Club community in Seminole County have been left to watch in horror as the roads within the community flood every time there is a heavy rain storm because the water now has nowhere to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo Credit: Reddit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The homeowner, Diane Goglas, took drastic measures after claiming that the pipe was leaking and causing erosion in her yard and that the HOA was doing nothing about it.

Without them, residents have had to resort to putting sandbags in front of their properties and erecting signs that say, "Slow, No Wake Zone" along the roads to protect themselves from the flood waters. Seminole County officials say there is little they can do to rectify the situation, so the HOA has filed a lawsuit to order Diane Goglas to remove the concrete from the pipe or have a new one installed.

&lt;p&gt;Reports on Sunday said a two-year-old girl succumbed to complications from the infection at Hadassah-University Medical Center, Ein Kerem, following a ten-day hospitalization in serious condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her death marks the eighth fatality since the outbreak began in April. The Ministry of Health (MoH) confirmed that all eight children who have died were unvaccinated and under the age of two and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current wave, initially concentrated in low-coverage areas like Jerusalem, Beit Shemesh, and Bnei Brak, has expanded significantly recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official data indicates that over 1,700 patients have been diagnosed with measles, but statistical models estimate the actual number of infected individuals is closer to 5,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that the illness is being underdiagnosed, and there are a few thousand additional patients with the disease," said Sharon Alroy-Preis, ‘Israel's’ chief epidemiologist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is placing a severe burden on the 'Israeli' health system, with 468 patients requiring hospitalization, 93% of whom are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Roya News</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 09:46:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiSEFVX3lxTE1nSUZfYzBHRlNBd0FhZGlGMGFrVmpydGp0M1c5am5icVB4YWRZeXBZTk1UVkQ1bVc5ekM1TWM2aGZTQWJqVHhSaQ</guid></item><item><title>禽流感卷土重来引发了对准备就绪的担忧- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/10/27/bird-flu-preparedness-fears</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 09:30:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9KNjN4U3lWRDlpRkhyUnJPRmdSUE5JY2tmNnFWZE5vakwxRVNGYzBTZm14SXNBYTdaMllKQ2dsZUVJQ0U1bDltQjBhYW1sMTg4MGpZZTBLa0tydWJzcGVYTU9NMk9aeHp6d2c4SA</guid></item><item><title>有3分钟的时间吗？这种习惯可能有助于增加希望和减轻压力- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/10/27/nx-s1-5575251/social-media-hope-stress-mental-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Research finds people who feel low are more likely to seek out negative social media content. But those who watch inspirational stories are more hopeful and less stressed.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Our social media feeds can push us to the dark side, with content full of strife and anger, or videos that make us feel bad about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there is a way to reprogram what you see by making different choices. And a new study finds three to five minutes of inspiring content each day can help you &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/nx-s1-5316220/blah-buoyant-skills-improve-mood-optimism-stress-reduction" target="_blank"&gt;feel more positive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers scoured the internet for videos that elicited "wow" emojis or had gone viral. They identified "underdog" narratives, where a person overcomes adversity, such as the real life story of Sean Swarner, a cancer survivor who set out to climb Mt. Everest. He had battled Hodgkin lymphoma, and had only one functioning lung.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As part of the study, participants watched a&lt;a href="https://www.seanswarner.com/" target="_blank"&gt; video of Swarner&lt;/a&gt; describing his quest, and other videos like it, of people succeeding against the odds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;It turns out that watching&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/03/10/469785736/he-rescued-a-dog-then-the-dog-rescued-him" target="_blank"&gt; someone overcome adversity &lt;/a&gt;can make us feel good. "We found that people felt more hopeful after watching the inspiring videos, " says&lt;a href="https://www.comm.ucsb.edu/people/robin-nabi" target="_blank"&gt; study author Robin Nabi&lt;/a&gt; of UC Santa Barbara. "And that hope predicted lower stress over the next ten days," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study included about a thousand adults from across the U.S., ages 18 to 86. One group watched an inspiring video, about three to five minutes in length, every day for five days. Others watched comedy, while another group did a few minutes of meditation, and a control group didn't watch any media. The participants completed surveys at the beginning and end of the study to assess changes in feelings of hope and stress.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Comedy didn't move the needle much. People who watched comedy did not differ from the control group, but both the inspiring videos and the meditation significantly increased hope.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were actually quite surprised at how similar the effects of the inspiring videos were to the group that meditated," Nabi says. "Both groups felt more hope," she explains — and that predicted less stress 10 days later. The research is &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/ppm-ppm0000623.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Psychology of Popular Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a publication of the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Nabi says the effects were not dramatic, because nothing as simple as watching a few videos can have a massive effect on your long-term well-being. Our moods and emotions are complicated, and influenced by multiple factors. But even though the effects are small, she says they are still significant. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"These small effects can accrue over time," says Nabi. Hopefulness helps us feel like we can deal with the things causing the stress in our lives.  "So the question is: What happens when we make this a habit?" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Positive content leads to positive feelings &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This finding is not a surprise at all to me, " says &lt;a href="https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=30504" target="_blank"&gt;Judith Moskowitz of Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt; who studies &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5082364/anxiety-stress-positive-coping-class-skills" target="_blank"&gt;the impact of positive emotions&lt;/a&gt;. "It's great to have the science tell us what we sort of know intuitively —  that if we look at positive content, we're going to feel more positive and more hope," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the study, participants were sent the videos, and agreed to watch as part of the study. This is different from what happens when we simply start scrolling, so Moskowitz says the challenge is to take this finding and implement it in your own life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"How can you change your focus to find the more positive things in your feed to help you sustain hope?" It's tricky, she acknowledges.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Social media algorithms can nudge us towards the negative because highly arousing or thrilling content tends to capture our attention and keep us on the apps, even when it's negative, explains media researcher &lt;a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/allison-eden" target="_blank"&gt;Allison Eden of Michigan State University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Media can be a powerful tool for coping and mood management," she says. But we have to proactively choose the positive.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And here's another challenge: &lt;a href="https://cogcommscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/gong_huskey_eden_ulusoy_main_2023_joc.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Her research shows&lt;/a&gt; people tend to seek out scary or sad content when they're in bad moods, rather than something that will bring joy or calm. In fact, that preference got stronger when their mood worsened," Eden says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We don't always connect the dots between what we're watching and how it makes us feel, whether it's the movies we choose on streaming apps or the content in our social media feeds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eden says there are multiple strategies to "counterprogram" your social feeds, with the intention of seeing more "feel good" content. Here are three things to try:&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Seed your feed with the positive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt; "Make an effort that the first couple of things that you search for every day are things that are going to put you in a positive frame," Eden says. Find hashtags that match your interests, such as positive body image, wildlife, puppies, sports moments, or content that aligns with your hobbies whether its mahjong, pickleball or your musical interests, anything that could help you feel good.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Keep a media log&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt; Every time you watch something ask yourself how you feel. Write down your responses. Tracking will help you connect the dots between your media use and your mood. After a few weeks you may see a pattern of how your choices influence your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Wipe your feed&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you see too much anxiety-evoking content or content you don't like, you can start over by deleting your account and opening a new one. "I do this myself," Eden says, from time to time, as a re-set. This is an opportunity to check in with whether your feed is working for you — or against you, and reset your online presence. Think of it as a "digital cleanse" or detox. You can also opt for a weekly break, such as a 24 hour pause from social media, to get distance.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SARASOTA, Fla. — Florida plans to end nearly a half-century of required childhood immunizations against diseases that have killed and maimed millions of children. Many critics of the decision, including doctors, are afraid to speak up against it.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;With the support of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo on Sept. 3 announced his plan to end all school-age vaccination mandates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” he told a cheering crowd of vaccination foes in Tallahassee. “Who am I, as a government or anyone else,” he said, “to tell you what you should put in your body?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;History shows that mandates increase the use of vaccines. Lower vaccination rates will mean increased rates of diseases like measles, hepatitis, meningitis, and pneumonia — and even the return of diphtheria and polio. Many of these diseases threaten not just the unvaccinated but also those they come in contact with, including babies and older people with weakened immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that scientific fact is being left unsaid in Florida. Health officials have largely been silent in the face of Ladapo’s campaign — and not because they agree with him. The University of Florida muzzled infectious disease experts, said emeritus professor Doug Barrett, formerly the university’s chief of pediatrics and senior vice president for health affairs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re told not to speak to anyone without permission from supervisors,” he said. University spokespeople didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;County-level Department of Health officials across the state got the same message, said John Sinnott, a retired professor at the University of South Florida who is friends with one of the county health leaders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sarasota County’s health department referred a reporter to state officials in Tallahassee, who responded with a statement that vaccines will “remain available” to families who want them. The state did not respond to other requests for comment or for an interview with Ladapo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many pediatricians are silent, too, at least in public.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of them don’t take a strong stance on whether kids need to be vaccinated,” said Neil Manimala, a urologist and the president-elect of the Hillsborough County Medical Association. “They don’t want to lose business. And there are enough anti-vax people who can lambaste you on Google, spreading stories about clinicians who ‘want to instill the poison jabs.’”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of Modern Vaccine Mandates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several states ended vaccination mandates early last century when smallpox was the only widely given vaccine, said historian Robert Johnston of the University of Illinois-Chicago. None has done so since other vaccines were added to the schedule. (Routine smallpox vaccination ended in 1972).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, persistent measles outbreaks provoked officials to strengthen child protection with enforced school mandates in every state. Today the partisan split on vaccine policy in the wake of the covid outbreak has changed the equation. This is nowhere more the case than in Florida, although legislators in Texas and Louisiana are also considering ending mandatory vaccination, and Idaho enables parents to get an exemption just by asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is really going to be a watershed moment for families who already were not sure they want to do vaccines and now are being told they don’t need them,” said Jennifer Takagishi, vice president of the Florida branch of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to know how fast vaccine-preventable diseases might return if Florida ends its mandates — or how the public will respond. Asked &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGrXoUR5iGA"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt; whether his office had modeled disease outcomes before his September announcement, Ladapo said “Absolutely not.” Parental freedom of choice isn’t a scientific matter, he said. “It’s an issue of right and wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ladapo’s Department of Health did not respond a month later when asked whether it was making contingency plans for outbreaks. During a &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/florida-defies-cdc-measles-outbreak/"&gt;2024 measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Broward County, Ladapo sent parents a letter granting them permission to send unvaccinated children to school, defying the science-supported advice from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1977, a measles epidemic that killed two children in Los Angeles County spurred a dramatic crackdown on vaccine-shunning across the country. But during an epidemic this year that killed two Texas children and &lt;a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico"&gt;14 people in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill making it easier for parents to opt out of getting required shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When are we going to have enough of a groundswell of people dying or becoming severely ill that leads people to push back and say, ‘No, no, we want the vaccines?’” Takagishi said. “I don’t know if we know the tipping point yet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have the answer,” said Emory University emeritus professor Walter Orenstein, who worked on measles for many of his 26 years at the CDC and led the agency’s immunization program from 1988 to 2004. “Measles resurgences created the political will to support our overall immunization program. For some reason it hasn’t worked this time. It’s just sad.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Youngsters in Florida are already among the least vaccinated in the nation, because of relatively lax enforcement, the post-covid backlash against shots, and the libertarian attitude of state officials. Statewide, only about 89% of kindergartners are fully vaccinated, with Sarasota County having the lowest rate, at about 80%. To be safe from the spread of measles, a community must be 95% immunized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cutting vaccine research, filling the health agency with anti-vaccine activists and spreading doubt about vaccination’s safety and value, little stands in the way of decisions by Florida officials that are likely to cause rates to sink further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ladapo’s department is ending mandates for shots against hepatitis B, chickenpox, and the bacteria causing meningitis and pneumonia. Early next year, the Florida Legislature is expected to take up reversal of a 1977 law requiring kids at school and day care to be vaccinated against seven other diseases that can kill children: whooping cough, measles, polio, rubella, mumps, diphtheria, and tetanus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After Measles, Which Disease Returns Next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the face of these attacks, scientists are attempting to predict which diseases are likely to make a resurgence and when.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833361"&gt;study published in April&lt;/a&gt; by Stanford epidemiologist Mathew Kiang and colleagues estimated that even at current vaccination levels, measles, declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, is likely to become a routine illness again. If measles vaccination rates drop by an additional 10%, there could be an average of about 450,000 cases yearly, with hundreds of deaths and cases of brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the study may exaggerate the threat, said Shaun Truelove, an epidemic disease modeler at Johns Hopkins University who said he’s worried about losing public trust with alarmist predictions. Still, he said, an intensification of measles outbreaks seems certain. The country is already in the midst of its worst measles year in three decades, with more than 1,500 cases and current outbreaks in South Carolina and Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You don’t really need to model measles if vaccines stop,” Truelove said. “In the pockets where there are outbreaks, every kid who isn’t vaccinated will get infected.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles is the “canary in the coal mine” for other vaccine-preventable diseases, said Sal Anzalone, a pediatrician with Healthcare Network in Naples, Florida. “When you start seeing measles, there’s more to come behind that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who want vaccinations will still be able to get them if mandates are eliminated, Ladapo has said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the state’s message confuses parents, especially the poor and underserved, Anzalone said. It’s typically hard for them to get children to appointments unless they have to, he said, noting that 80% of his patients are insured through Medicaid. If policies put more of the payment burden on parents, fewer will vaccinate, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if vaccinations fall and infections increase, children won’t be the only people affected. Cancer patients and people in Florida’s numerous elderly communities would be at risk. Schools and businesses would be disrupted. Disease could disrupt the tourism industry, which brought 143 million people to the state last year. (The Florida Chamber of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Infectious diseases don’t stop with the people who say they are willing to bear the risk,” said Meagan Fitzpatrick, a University of Maryland vaccinologist. Because of their unpredictable spread, she said, “with an infectious disease, vaccination is never an individual choice.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinicians fear that an end to mandates could allow hepatitis B, a chronic liver disease, to return with force, since an estimated 2 million Americans carry the virus. They also foresee a return to the days when infants with high fever had to undergo a painful and risky lumbar puncture and blood draw to rule out meningitis, as well as a blood infection caused by the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/em&gt; type B that routine vaccination has prevented since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Barbara Loe Fisher, who co-founded the modern movement against vaccine mandates in the early 1980s after her son suffered a reaction to the pertussis vaccine then in use (and since replaced with a safer shot), is skeptical that Floridians will abandon vaccination en masse, despite the end to mandates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fisher, president of the National Vaccine Information Center, moved from Virginia to southwestern Florida in 2020. She said she believes that vaccine injuries are undercounted and that children are vaccinated without informed consent. She acknowledged that mandates have increased coverage but said their removal will increase trust in public health and medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is time to allow biological products like vaccines to be subject to the law of supply and demand,” she said, “just like any other product sold in the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sinnott, for his part, anticipates measles will come roaring back, along with intensified whooping cough, influenza, and covid outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They think nothing will happen. Maybe they’re right,” said Sinnott, the retired professor. “It’s an experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Polio could return, and that is not an abstraction for Sinnott, 77.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He was 7 years old when he contracted the disease, spending six months in a wheelchair. In recent years he’s suffered from post-polio syndrome — difficulty swallowing, and tightness and pain in his limbs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first polio vaccine was licensed in 1955, the year he got sick. “I remember one time my mother telling me, ‘The line was too long,’” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sinnott forgives his parents, and parents today who waver on vaccination. He’s less tolerant of certain public health leaders. They should know better, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis is interesting. Treatment is exciting.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve fond memories from early in my career prescribing medications that within minutes relieved patients smothering from congestive heart failure, pulled them back from near death from septic shock, or slowed the progression of their diabetes or heart disease. In my fellowship, my prescription of carbidopa transformed the first patient with Parkinson’s disease I diagnosed.

What does it mean for cancer patients? And how did the COVID-19 pandemic become the medium for this unlikely discovery?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_3121566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3121566" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-3121566" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP22055206266652-1723796751.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="mpox virus" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-3121566" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A nurse loads a syringe with the child’s dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine prior to vaccinating a Jackson Public School student at a vaccination station in Jackson, Mississipi, US, on February 16, 2022 [Rogelio V Solis/AP]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-an-mrna-vaccine"&gt;What is an mRNA vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional vaccines, which used weakened or inactive parts of a virus to trigger the immune system to build a defence, mRNA vaccines deliver a small strand of genetic code known as “messenger RNA” directly into the body’s cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cell reads this blueprint as an instruction to manufacture a spike protein which mimics that of the virus, and display it on its surface, effectively waving a red flag that alerts the immune system to build a defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body then creates antibodies and memory cells trained to recognise and attack that protein spike if it ever appears again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-did-researchers-discover-the-link-between-mrna-and-cancer"&gt;How did researchers discover the link between mRNA and cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an area of research which has been going on for some years, most notably by paediatric oncologist Elias Sayour, the Stop Children’s Cancer/Bonnie R Freeman Professor for Pediatric Oncology Research at the University of Florida, in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-newsletter-slot" data-testid="article-newsletter-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic presented a particular opportunity to study the implications of mRNA for cancer treatment as the world moved en masse to vaccinate the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sayour’s former student, oncologist Adam Grippin, examined clinical data of more than 1,000 patients treated between August 2019 and August 2023 at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, he found a striking pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who had received a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting immunotherapy lived significantly longer than those who received the same medical treatment but did not have the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1553721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1553721" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-1553721" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AP21302760243116.jpg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C513&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="covid" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1553721" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Medical staff transport a body of a patient who died of COVID-19 at the morgue of the city hospital 1 in Rivne, Ukraine, October 22, 2021 [File: Evgeniy Maloletka/AP]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-longer-did-people-live-with-the-vaccine"&gt;How much longer did people live with the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For patients with advanced lung cancer, the median survival rate nearly doubled if they had the vaccine, rising from 20.6 months to 37.3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, the survival improvements were most pronounced in patients with immunologically “cold” tumours – meaning that the mRNA vaccine appeared to “wake up” the immune system in patients with these harder-to-treat cancers – turning “cold” tumours into ones the immune system could more easily recognise and attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that their findings were consistent across varying factors, such as different vaccine manufacturers, doses and time of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also compared the survival rates in a smaller group of patients receiving immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma, the most advanced stage of a type of skin cancer. In the study, 43 patients had an mRNA COVID vaccine and 167 did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who did not receive the vaccine had a median survival of just more than two years. By contrast, those who were vaccinated before starting treatment had not yet reached their median survival point more than three years into follow-up, the research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-it-work"&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that mRNA vaccines work like an alarm for the body’s defence system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the vaccine is given, it puts the immune system on alert, making it more likely to notice cancer cells that it might have ignored before. Once the immune system is activated, it begins to attack these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But cancer cells fight back. They produce a protein called PD-L1, which works as a shield that “hides” them from the immune system. However, there are drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors that can block this shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When both the vaccine and these drugs are used, it creates the ideal situation – the immune system is active and alert, and the cancer’s defences are down, Grippin explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers said that they do not yet fully understand the mechanisms, the findings suggest that mRNA vaccines can be used to re-programme immune responses to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_893764" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-893764" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" class="size-arc-image-770 wp-image-893764" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2ccf155507c742e595d8797bf6fa7276_18.jpeg?w=770&amp;amp;resize=770%2C434&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="China pharmaceuticals lab" fetchpriority="low"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-893764" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A technician inspects anti-cancer drugs in vials at a lab of a pharmaceutical company in Lianyungang, Jiangsu province, China, on March 13, 2019 [File: Stringer/Reuters]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-cancer-patients"&gt;What does this mean for cancer patients?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are preliminary. If, however, the study is validated in clinical trials, it could have huge implications for the treatment of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These vaccines produce powerful anti-tumour immune responses that are associated with massive improvements in survival for patients with cancer,” Grippin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The implications are extraordinary – this could revolutionise the entire field of oncologic care,” said Sayour. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilise and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grippen, who co-led the study with Steven Lin, professor of radiation oncology, said his team is launching a Phase 3 clinical trial to confirm the initial results and investigate whether COVID mRNA vaccines should be made part of the standard of care for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-did-scientists-find-in-tests-with-mice"&gt;What did scientists find in tests with mice?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mouse experiments, researchers found that injecting an mRNA COVID vaccine directly into a tumour made dendritic cells – a type of white blood cell – more alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the dendritic cells picked up on presence of the tumour, they sent out signals that attracted T cells to come and attack it. In some mice, this helped slow the growth of the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s a big catch. Not everyone naturally has T cells that are capable of killing cancer cells. For some people, their immune system can tell that a tumour is dangerous, but their specific T cells do not know how to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason why immunotherapies – treatments that boost the immune system to fight cancer – work for some patients but not for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an mRNA COVID vaccine will not make your body produce new tumour-fighting T cells. What it might do, based on this early research, is make dendritic cells more likely to notice a tumour and effectively deploy the T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 07:41:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPRTV3d0xSMVlITGlLVGYtaDZUcjZJZjJTY05NSWpGeW1Wd0NxT1V5ZkhfSGtLd29mX0VTTUFBQTI0THJEZEE0ZFBGQm5ZalE4NEdvWG5IbGRDSEo5ZnZkQlFWZmFBa093WVZOblJMejdwTTZsQlY3aHRCMGYtVy1kMGVEV0l0VGdhM2hVNldmaUtGd9IBlwFBVV95cUxPaU9kV0VWdXJ6VTEtQm1HSUcwRkxSWVBBRk9zcEpvTV9Hd1dpM3M0YnQ1OXM3RjQxUFNrVlh4cU1NSVp1SHU4R3NsSWF3QjJ3UUZKT3JUVkx2bENZcEVPMXpUYmFuS3hVMGZDVnVJc1Q2aXZYaDc0Tk85UXBkeXRxUTFPQ3dRcjZEMVpIdVJWUjNva2VKd2Zn</guid></item><item><title>我为自己尝试了彩色步行热潮，结果让我大吃一惊- Creative Bloq</title><link>https://www.creativebloq.com/creative-inspiration/i-tried-the-colour-walking-craze-for-myself-and-the-results-took-me-by-surprise</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p id="f6e2f401-72f0-4b6d-b772-ee42a27873c1"&gt;I'll be honest: when I first heard about colour walking, I rolled my eyes. Another walking trend? Really? Even if it involves &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/colour/colour-theory-11121290" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/colour/colour-theory-11121290"&gt;colour theory&lt;/a&gt;, I’m not sure I’m interested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, social media's brought us hot girl walks, silent walks, rucking, Nordic walking… And now comes colour walking. And the premise is almost insultingly simple. Before you head out for a walk, pick a colour, and spend your time noticing it in everything around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="f6e2f401-72f0-4b6d-b772-ee42a27873c1-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;That's it. No special equipment, no subscription service, no complicated breathing patterns. Just you, your chosen colour, and whatever your neighbourhood has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The trend started on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/tiktok" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/tiktok"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; back in 2021, though it's been knocking about in various forms for decades. Writer William Burroughs poetically called it "walking on colours," which sounds far more sophisticated than admitting you're following a social media craze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The idea is that by focusing your attention on seeking out one colour, you naturally become more present, more mindful, and less tangled up in the anxious nonsense that usually clutters your brain. So what happened when I actually tried to do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-bc90959b-9f1d-4ab8-9970-e39a320e806a" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="starting-cynical-3"&gt;Starting cynical&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="104553ef-1025-4316-8a66-593e7cf06ebe"&gt;First, let me share my general cynicism about this kind of stuff. I've tried meditation apps that promised enlightenment, but delivered only frustration. I've attempted breathing exercises that made me more stressed than before. I've even given silent walking a go, which mostly just made me hyper-aware of how loudly I breathe through my nose. So forgive me for assuming that colour walking wouldn't be for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was willing to give anything a try. I'd been ill for some time, and although my body had technically recovered, my mind was frazzled. I needed something, anything, to help me feel less like a tightly wound spring about to go boing across my home office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xFAy6TuE2EZo7rUTbfSC4o" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xFAy6TuE2EZo7rUTbfSC4o slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I chose blue, mostly because it felt green would be too easy, and headed out. No phone notifications, no podcast, no agenda beyond finding blue things. And blow me down, I actually found myself enjoying myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="f62f78b7-60a8-4043-88db-87d62b9aa707"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Future)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="2963cd38-5a5d-4bf4-9666-b730c2e67986"&gt;Within minutes, I found myself genuinely absorbed in the task. There was the obvious blue sky, yes, but then I started noticing things I'd walked past a hundred times without seeing: the forget-me-nots nestled against a garden wall, the vivid blue of a recycling bin, someone's turquoise front door, the way a discarded plastic bag caught the light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't counting steps or mentally rehearsing difficult conversations or wondering what I'd cook for dinner. I was just… thinking about blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, I walked more slowly, noticed more things, and felt genuinely lighter in both body and mind by the time I got home. I've kept it up for a week now, choosing different colours each time, and I'm still enjoying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-3f807731-7c8b-49ad-8ea8-f838ef8da706" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-it-works-3"&gt;Why it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9aaf5550-85cd-465f-92a5-5d818c294226"&gt;Once I'd found that it works, I was keen to learn why. So apparently, colour walking is effectively because combines physical movement (which releases endorphins) with focused attention (which keeps your mind anchored in the present moment). So it's essentially a moving meditation for those of us who find sitting still frustratingly restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yellow brought unexpected joy when I spotted it in everything from dandelions to crisp packets. Red made me realise how vibrant my supposedly boring neighbourhood actually is. Even taking a punt on grey revealed subtle variations I'd never appreciated before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the biggest revelation? You don't need expensive classes or complicated techniques to feel calm. Sometimes the simplest practices are the most effective…. even if they do come from TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;

But, excess of everything in the body is bad! When excess goes unnoticed, it becomes toxic! In contrast to water-soluble vitamins that are excreted through urine, vitamin D is fat soluble, so it builds up in the tissues with time. When we consume more than we can utilise in the body, overtime this accumulation becomes toxic, and this symptom is medically diagnosed, called as hypervitaminosis D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Doctor Vassily Eliopoulos, one shouldn't go overboard with it as “too much vitamin D can backfire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy ways to increase your Vitamin D intake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vass lists three essential practices that one should consider while taking vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks of vitamin D overuse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blindly taking vitamin D can cause calcium to buildup in the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Excess calcium may damage the arteries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidneys can be affected, potentially leading to kidney stones&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Check before supplementing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not everyone needs vitamin D supplements&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple blood tests can determine if supplementation is necessary&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Correct way to consume vitamin D&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair it with magnesium for maximum absorption and vitamin k2 which directs calcium to bones and not arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid supplementing without taking a test&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Four key steps for safe supplementation&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get tested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not follow marketing, know the body's need&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimise dose and timing for the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seek professional guidance, not social media influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with the Vitamin D excess:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary issue with excess vitamin D involves its impact on calcium within the body. Vitamin D enhances intake of calcium from the intestines into the bloodstream. When the levels of this vitamin become excessively high and enter the unsafe realm, calcium absorption grows out of control, driving blood levels of calcium well beyond the normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This surplus calcium, or hypercalcemia, is responsible for making vitamin D toxicity lethal. Symptoms may begin mildly, with weakness, nausea, or muscle aching, and gradually escalate to more serious complications such as vomiting, bone discomfort, kidney stones, and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The impact on kidneys&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kidneys tend to be the first organs to suffer damage. They strive to remove excess calcium from the bloodstream and over time can produce calcification of the kidneys and permanent damage. Individuals with vitamin D poisoning usually have elevated urination and thirst because the body attempts to eliminate excess calcium in the urine. Over time, this stress can weaken kidney function and make it more difficult to maintain electrolytes and blood pressure. Ironically, the very substance that helps maintain healthy bones can, in large amounts, weaken the skeletal system by extracting calcium from the bones and leaving it in soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Common misconception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the misconceptions about vitamin D is that toxicity never originates from sunlight or food. The body will automatically control how much vitamin D it will produce from sun exposure, and foods such as fish, eggs, or fortified milk provide a modest dose. The true peril comes with supplements. Since vitamin D supplements are easily found and sometimes sold as energy and immune system boosters, it is easy to overconsume them. Most toxicity cases occur when individuals consume high-dose supplements over months without medical check-up. Taking more than 10,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day over a long time can elevate the 25‑hydroxyvitamin D in the blood levels way above safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, a person with excessive vitamin D may not notice anything out of the ordinary. Toxicity symptoms tend to develop slowly. They may consist of nausea, constipation, and dehydration on onset, followed by more chronic issues such as bone pain, abnormal heart rate, and arterial, lung, or kidney tissue calcification. Calcium deposits in places they shouldn't be result in the internal mechanisms of the body becoming stiff and more susceptible to illness. For instance, calcified arteries become less capable of expanding and contracting properly, increasing the risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per PubMed central, the signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such as difficulty in concentration, confusion, apathy, drowsiness, depression, psychosis, and in extreme cases, a stupor and coma. The gastrointestinal symptoms of VDT include recurrent vomiting, abdominal pain, polydipsia, anorexia, constipation, peptic ulcers, and pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicians primarily diagnose vitamin D poisoning through a blood test for calcium and 25‑hydroxyvitamin D. When both are elevated, the disease is diagnosed. Treatment is primarily stopping all supplements of vitamin D outright and cutting calcium intake. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, corticosteroids, or certain drugs known as bisphosphonates are administered to decrease calcium levels immediately. The process of healing takes a long time as vitamin D stored in fat cells is slowly released, so its effects can last weeks or even months after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal daily intake for most adults falls between 600 and 800 IU according to NIH, although older individuals or individuals who have very limited sun exposure can require a little more under medical supervision. Ongoing blood levels are the safest method of knowing if supplementation is truly providing benefit. For the majority of instances, healthy vitamin D levels are just a matter of balance. Limited sun exposure, a balanced diet, and occasional supplementation, if necessary, are sufficient to sustain healthy bones and general well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the tale of vitamin D toxicity has a wider message about moderation. Nutrients, like much in life, provide benefits only within a specific range. Too little exposes the body to risk; too much quietly harms.
