Those adding a little bit of&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/food-and-drink/cinnamon-products-lead-consumer-reports-b2614447.html"&gt; cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; to their sugar or hot beverage of choice aren't likely to have any issues, but consuming the spice in high doses could &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/health-and-wellbeing/gemma-collins-mounjaro-wegovy-ozempic-b2737810.html"&gt;cause complications&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Health concerns could arise if excessive amounts of supplements are consumed without the knowledge of health care provider or prescriber of the medications,” Shabana Khan, a principal scientist involved in the study, said. “Overconsumption of supplements could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary compound in cinnamon, cinnamaldehyde, can activate receptors in the body that actually breaks down certain medicines, researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted in the study that cinnamon oil — typically used in cooking and for toiletries — poses no risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not the same for cinnamon bark. The study found that bark, especially that of Cassia cinnamon, a cheaper Chinese version of the spice, have the potential to cause medicine-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 kSitga"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="New research out of the University of Mississippi found that ingesting high doses of cinnamon could lower the efficacy of some prescription medications" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-12009"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;New research out of the University of Mississippi found that ingesting high doses of cinnamon could lower the efficacy of some prescription medications&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“True cinnamon from Sri Lanka carries a lower risk due to its reduced coumarin content,” the study's co-author Amar Chittiboyina, associate director of the National Center for Natural Products Research, said. “Coumarin’s anticoagulant properties can be hazardous for individuals on blood thinners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon typically carried in grocery stores is generally made of Cassia cinnamon bark, according to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/27/health/popular-spice-could-interfere-with-prescription-drugs-study/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone consumes a significant amount of cinnamon regularly or has concerns about their cinnamon intake, they should speak to their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan said that anyone relying on medications to stay healthy should check with their doctors before taking supplements that could interact negatively with their treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who suffer from chronic diseases — like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, asthma, obesity, HIV, AIDS or depression — should be cautious when using cinnamon or any other supplements," Khan said. “Our best advice is to talk to a health care provider before using any supplements along with the prescription medicine. By definition, supplements are not meant to treat, cure or mitigate any disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 29 Apr 2025 05:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNZzNtazNnQWxHQ1QtZ3VYNEZDMno2QVJrMWRUcllPNHdWMTIyMmFHN1hRWUg5LTMzMFR2Zm1STGFpTDQ0YTJOcUFFenh3VGJ1OUcteXFIU09xMDlzNzhlYVpVRmJhaF95VUhFNDZKcWY2aGtMb0puUEczRDVpbVBMa0F4XzhQMW1oUzhLb1V6WlBJZkR5eHNpemthRy1xeWo4N0hBLWhwYmpaZXotTE1PcmJPLUJpNF9XUUFv</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，家用塑料制品中的化学物质与心脏病死亡有关- CNN | Chemicals in household plastic products linked to heart disease deaths, study says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPYjV0UUo3c19QZFNsTmxPTVowbTZaNFZPTDJ3RlVzR3JXUkEwMDM0QVUyQlBiNnVlSXJTcGZLa21EdHdxekVNWnBoblNrOHlrZ1B0VHExWXo0VmtTSmkwYTlLUF9GMThRU2ZkRWVTUjhKeWxwMFJUd3BIUEl5TXpGN3RhSzhSaGRndFHSAYABQVVfeXFMT0pyYXhNNVdLeTM0em5KQkM1RUZkc0VMeU5sSWlXOGFPRzktdHd2eHYxSnJzc3prcDA0NjhoMld5dHBGNTlDN0Jpdmo4Q0FlSDJqZTBqQ1I4akFSSmxaZ19yTGJ4VUFoakZFMmxHbzVpWXhaQjczT204WHJ2VEZXSGg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Synthetic chemicals called phthalates, found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children’s toys, may have contributed to more than 10% of all global mortality from heart disease in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64, a new study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000e3b6mzf1pjf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,” said senior author Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. He also is director of NYU Langone’s Division of Environmental Pediatrics and Center for the Investigation of Environmental Hazards.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000f3b6mautkc2qb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Phthalates are known to disrupt testosterone,” Trasande said, adding that in men, “low testosterone is a predictor of adult cardiovascular disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000g3b6m03ieospc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Phthalates have been linked in earlier studies with &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2478/s13382-011-0022-2" target="_blank"&gt;reproductive problems&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27567446/" target="_blank"&gt;genital malformations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280383/" target="_blank"&gt;undescended testes &lt;/a&gt;in baby boys and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27546318/#:~:text=The%20general%20exposure%20to%20endocrine,malformations%20of%20the%20genital%20tract." target="_blank"&gt;lower sperm counts&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7067547/" target="_blank"&gt; testosterone levels &lt;/a&gt;in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1247566/" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385443/" target="_blank"&gt;childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230099912965" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The new study underscores the potentially enormous health and economic burden of DEHP exposure, which aligns with existing concerns about its risks,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer at the Environmental Working Group, a consumer organization that monitors exposure to phthalates and other chemicals in plastics, in an email. He was not involved with the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Chemistry Council, which represents industry, declined to comment on the study but told CNN via email that the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.americanchemistry.com/industry-groups/high-phthalates" target="_blank"&gt;High Phthalates Panel&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to promoting the benefits of high phthalates such as DINP and DIDP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Phthalates exposure and risk
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000j3b6mfno0kpmh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Often called “&lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/sites/default/files/research/supported/translational/peph/resources/assets/docs/phthalates_the_everywhere_chemical_zero_breast_cancer_508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;everywhere chemicals&lt;/a&gt;” because they are so common, phthalates are added to consumer products such as PVC plumbing pipes, vinyl flooring, rain- and stain-resistant products, medical tubing, garden hoses and some children’s toys to make the plastic more flexible and harder to break.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000k3b6myh1jt81h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other common exposures come from the use of phthalates in food packaging, detergents, clothing, furniture and automotive plastics. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/phthalates-cosmetics" target="_blank"&gt;Phthalates&lt;/a&gt; are also added to personal care items such as shampoo, soap, hair spray and cosmetics to make fragrances last longer.&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/health/shopping-toxic-chemicals-wellness/index.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

            People are exposed when they breathe contaminated air or eat or drink foods that come into contact with the plastic, according to the &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

            The new study, &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2025.105730" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal eBiomedicine, examined the impact of one phthalate — &lt;a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/TSP/ToxFAQs/ToxFAQsDetails.aspx?faqid=377&amp;amp;toxid=65" target="_blank"&gt;Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate&lt;/a&gt;, or DEHP — on global deaths across 200 countries and territories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000n3b6m610vnucu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed health and environmental data from dozens of population surveys, which included urine samples containing chemical breakdown products left by DEHP, which is known to be connected to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7570088/#:~:text=The%20authors%20found%20a%20positive,subclinical%20atherosclerosis%2C%20enhancing%20the%20risk" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, Trasande said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000o3b6mqoh2ib40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate has also been linked to birth defects, cancer and reproductive harm for men, according to California’s &lt;a href="https://www.p65warnings.ca.gov/fact-sheets/di2-ethylhexylphthalate-dehp" target="_blank"&gt;Proposition 65&lt;/a&gt;, a law that requires companies to place warning labels on products notifying consumers about chemicals’ possible health effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000p3b6mdnfg65k6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers compared the exposure with death statistics collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, a US research group that gathers global medical information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000q3b6mrvx58kr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis found exposure to DEHP contributed to 368,764 deaths in 2018 among men and women ages 55 through 64 globally. Africa accounted for 30% of the deaths from heart disease linked to DEHP, while East Asia and the Middle East accounted for 25% of the mortality, the study found.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000r3b6mm1bfdioa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research is believed to be the first global estimate of any health outcome from exposure to the DEHP, said lead study author Sara Hyman, an associate research scientist at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000s3b6mv63u81ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “By highlighting the connection between phthalates and a leading cause of death across the world, our findings add to the vast body of evidence that these chemicals present a tremendous danger to human health,” Hyman said in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000t3b6mllcyynix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A limitation of the research, however, stems from the use of hazard ratios the US to estimate population-attributable deaths in other countries, EWG’s Andrews said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000u3b6m0fj7a2zw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While the authors acknowledge this limitation, it assumes that the relationship between DEHP exposure and cardiovascular disease is consistent globally,” he said in an email. “This may not hold true given significant differences in both exposure levels and access to CVD detection and treatment across countries.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000v3b6mxpdd7sf0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/health/plastic-chemical-early-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; by Trasande and his team measured the urine concentration of phthalates in more than 5,000 adults in the United States and compared those levels with the risk of early death over an average of 10 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc000w3b6mhoxmte59@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749121016031?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found phthalates may contribute to some 91,000 to 107,000 premature deaths a year among Americans ages 55 to 64&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;People with the highest levels of phthalates had a greater risk of death from any cause, especially cardiovascular mortality, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The results held even after researchers controlled for preexisting heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other common conditions, poor eating habits, physical activity and body mass, and levels of other known &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/17/health/bpa-bisphenol-a-plastics-canned-foods-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;hormone disruptors such as bisphenol A or BPA&lt;/a&gt;.

            Researchers estimated those deaths could cost the United States about $40 billion to $47 billion each year in lost economic productivity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It is possible to minimize your exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Avoid plastics as much as you can. Reducing your use of ultraprocessed foods can reduce the levels of the chemical exposures you come in contact with,” Trasande said. “Never put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, where the heat can break down the linings so they might be absorbed more readily.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Here are other tips to reduce exposure:
    &lt;/p&gt;

            ·       Buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables instead of canned and processed versions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9x5okyc00163b6mi2btagjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            ·       Avoid air fresheners and all plastics labeled as No. 3, No. 6 and No. 7.

He has also outlived both of his less-active brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor believes that following his seven simple lifestyle rules can help prevent the on-set of age-related cardiovascular ailments like heart attacks, strokes and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-a540df90-2493-11f0-95c2-a5720af79fa2"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cdc.gov/heart-disease/data-research/facts-stats/index.html#:~:text=Heart%20disease%20is%20the%20leading,people%20died%20from%20heart%20disease."&gt;leading causes&lt;/a&gt; of disease and death in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutrition professor claims that abiding by his lifestyle rules can not only help prevent heart disease, but also potentially assist people to live a longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here's a breakdown of Dr Scharffenberg's seven lifestyle rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr John Scharffenberg, aged 102, is an American professor of nutrition who has shared the seven lifestyle rules he lives by that he believe prolong health and promote longevity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #1 - Never smoke &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor's message is simple when it comes to smoking: don't do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 102-year-old has never smoked and explains that the dangers of tobacco have been well known and documented since the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco-surgeon-general-reports/about/index.html"&gt;1964 Surgeon General report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking is proven to harm almost every organ in the body and is one of the biggest causes of preventable illness and death in many countries around the world, including in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, smoking-related diseases killed almost 20,500 Australians, equating to almost 50 preventable deaths every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #2 - Reassess beliefs around low-level drinking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to never smoking, Dr Scharffenberg abstains from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite research suggesting that light drinking or certain alcoholic drinks can offer some health benefits, Dr Scharffenberg pointed to &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31310-2/fulltext"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that show any protective effects offered by a low-level of alcohol consumption are offset by an increased cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His sentiment echoes the World Health Organization's &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/alcohol"&gt;guidance &lt;/a&gt;suggesting that no alcohol is the safest choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition professor Dr Scharffenberg believes the moderate benefits of low-level alcohol consumption are outweighed by the greater benefits of abstaining from alcohol&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #3 - Keeping your body active is important - especially over 40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even though I'm a nutritionist, I think exercise is even more important than nutrition,' Dr Scharffenberg said in a video shared on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PlantChompers"&gt;Viva Longevity!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor adds that he believes the most important life stage to exercise is during mid life, from the ages of 40 to 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's when you need it, because that's the time when people usually relax, have more money, buy more food, sit around more, eat more... and that's the wrong way to go.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition professor Dr Scharffenberg praises walking as an effective exercise for older people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The professor's preferred exercise routine is gardening and vigorous walking. He also referred to a &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199801083380204"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found people who walked more than two miles (3.22km) a day had only half the death rate of those who were less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg even said in an &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/101-year-old-nutrition-professor-rules-for-long-life-rcna199726"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with TODAY that he believes his highly active lifestyle was the reason he 'outlived' his two brothers by decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The main difference was I got a tremendous amount of exercise,' he theorised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #4 - No snacking and eat by the clock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the core of Dr Scharffenberg's rules is that what you eat makes a difference – and that means ensuring you maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nutrition professor recommends implementing simple guidelines around eating habits to ensure you don't gain unnecessary weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Eat at the proper time.

The expert explained that his final meal of the day is in the early afternoon and that he doesn't consume any food again until 6.30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #5 - Consider ditching this food for good&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a member of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Dr Scharffenberg has adhered to a vegetarian diet since childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The centenarian said that although he did later try meat, he hasn't eaten it since he was 20 years old. Instead, he follows a total plant-based diet, which includes milk and eggs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg's favourite foods include mangoes, persimmons, potatoes, macadamias and other nuts and seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says a vegetarian diet is 'optimum' because eating too much meat can &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical#:~:text=High%20saturated%20fat%20levels%20in,affect%20heart%20disease%20is%20complex."&gt;increase the risk &lt;/a&gt;of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nutrition professor Dr Scharffenberg follows a total plant-based diet, which includes milk and eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #6 - Get saturated fat intake down by cutting meat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This rule ties back into Dr Scharffenberg's edict about the benefits of adopting a vegetarian diet, because loads of saturated fats come from meat like beef, pork and poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Accordingly, Dr Scharffenberg says adhering to a vegetarian diet and getting rid of animal fat intake is the simplest way to avoid the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/eating-red-meat-daily-triples-heart-disease-related-chemical#:~:text=High%20saturated%20fat%20levels%20in,affect%20heart%20disease%20is%20complex."&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; associated with high saturated fat intake, like high blood pressure and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="femail-ccox mol-style-medium"&gt;Rule #7 - Say 'no' to your sweet tooth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Scharffenberg points to a clear link between sugar consumption and the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-too-much-added-sugar-increases-the-risk-of-dying-with-heart-disease-201402067021"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart disease as well as other weight gain related health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends modifying recipes to reduce sugar intake.

                                        Estimated read time: 2-3
                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — As the weather warms and people start cleaning, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services issued a warning about hantavirus — a disease passed through droppings, urine and saliva of mice or other rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Stirring up dust where rodents have been can cause hantavirus to get into the air where the particles can be breathed in," the department said Monday in a prepared release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It urges Utahns to be cautious when cleaning out sheds, cabins or other buildings that have had rodents present. The health department said hantavirus is rare; there are typically one or two reported cases in Utah each year, but it is fatal in about 60% of reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of hantavirus include fatigue, fever and muscle aches and can include headaches, dizziness, chills or stomach issues. A second phase of the disease brings coughing and shortness of breath due to liquid in the lungs, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kacy Nowak, an epidemiologist with the health department, said anyone who comes into contact with rodents that carry the virus is at risk for contracting hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Make sure you take precautions when you work in areas with potential rodent droppings and nests. Use a disinfectant spray on areas with droppings and wait 15-20 minutes before you clean. This will kill the virus and decrease your risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/prevention/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;other steps&lt;/a&gt; people can take to prevent contracting hantavirus include airing out closed buildings before going in, not sweeping droppings up, trapping mice, keeping pet food covered to not attract mice, sealing holes in homes and removing piles of trash, wood or junk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cleaning up after rodents, the health department encouraged wearing rubber or plastic gloves and washing hands afterwards; soaking urine, droppings and nests with bleach or disinfectant before cleaning; throwing away towels used to clean up in a covered can; and cleaning the area with a disinfectant again after removing the nest or droppings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico authorities say actor Gene Hackman's wife, Betsy Arakawa, likely died Feb. 11 at their Santa Fe home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Her autopsy report hasn't yet been released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Associated Press story published Monday said the leading cause of Hackman's death was heart disease. He was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and likely had not eaten for a long time, according to a new autopsy report. He appeared to have outlived Arakawa at home by about a week, possibly unaware of his wife's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas — As health officials begin &lt;a href="/article/news/health/austin-measles-exposure-warning-contact-tracing/269-1142c886-b99c-47e6-8adf-973a14542a0a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;contact tracing a second measles case in Travis County&lt;/a&gt;, some businesses are taking extra precautions to deal with the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin Public Health identified nine locations across Austin where the infected person visited, including the South Austin Mexican restaurant, Curra's, which has been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Julieta Rodriguez, the owner of Curra's, said she learned about the exposure at her establishment through news reports and had not heard from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"My first thought was, it’s going to kill business,” Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, Rodriguez said she hired a cleaning company to disinfect the restaurant over the weekend and has spoken to customers and staff since the case was reported.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every day we clean," Rodriguez said. "We follow protocol with health codes, so that's pretty much what we can do as far as right now."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez added that she and her staff are vaccinated and have not felt any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I can tell my customers is not to feel worried," Rodriguez said. “We're doing what we’re supposed to do."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health officials stressed there is still a risk of exposure despite the person who was infected being fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that a person who has been vaccinated is going to have less viral load,” said Dr. Desmar Walkes, the medical director and health authority for Austin Public Health. "While the patient did catch the virus, they only have mild symptoms and are able to rest at home."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes also shared what health officials are doing in terms of outreach after Rodriguez said she wasn't aware of the exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been calling those businesses, and we'll continue to do so to work with them to provide the information they need,” Walkes said. "It may have been that they hadn't received that call as of yet.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walkes, along with Austin Mayor Kirk Watson and Travis County Judge Andy Brown, reiterated the importance of getting the MMR vaccine as they ensure it is the best protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The key message today is that while we've had this second case of measles ... the best defense is vaccination,” Watson said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for people who are unsure of their immunity status against the virus, they can speak with their health provider and take a test. For many who may be wondering whether they need a booster, Walkes said the two required doses should be sufficient unless one’s immune system is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The above image shows hazmat-suited workers at a quarantine zone after an outbreak of bird flu in Victoria, Australia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A fellow GVN director and expert on animal viruses, Dr Ab Osterhaus, says that a potential vaccine could also help to solve the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Given the growing circulation of H5N1 among mammals, the GVN calls for urgent efforts to understand and interrupt transmission in cattle through herd management and potential vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Strengthening surveillance at animal-human interfaces is crucial, as current monitoring efforts are insufficient to guide effective prevention strategies.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Biden Administration awarded Moderna a $590 million contract to develop a vaccine for H5N1 bird flu vaccine but there were reports earlier this year that the new administration could pull that funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The White House Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response (OPPR), created after COVID-19 to coordinate rapid responses to outbreaks, has been left virtually unstaffed and unfunded since the Trump Administration came in, according to reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pandemic planning has also been moved inside the National Security Council, which critics fear limits transparency and public oversight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first US &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/bird-flu/index.html" id="mol-df4a7cb0-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; death was reported in January, with a person in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/louisiana/index.html" id="mol-df550400-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2" class=""&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; passing away after being hospitalized with severe respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials said the person was older than 65, had underlying medical problems and had been in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No other details were revealed. They also said a genetic analysis of the patient's infection suggested the bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-df4c9f90-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; virus had mutated while inside their body, which could have caused a more severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since March 2024, 70 confirmed bird flu infections have been reported in the US, but most illnesses have been mild and most have been detected among farmworkers directly exposed to sick poultry or dairy cows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In two cases - an adult in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-df555220-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt; and a child in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-df53cb80-cc77-11ef-9df4-6dd46bea0ad2"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - health officials have not determined how they contracted the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many experts put H5N1 at the top of their lists of pandemic threats, due to how widespread it is among animals and how rapidly it appears to be mutating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its growing presence in the environment increases the chances people will be exposed, and potentially catch it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marc Johnson, a virologist at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/missouri/index.html" id="mol-81777ee0-246e-11f0-b9de-a9e256473e2a" class=""&gt;Missouri&lt;/a&gt;, recently said on X: 'This virus might not go pandemic, but it is really trying hard, and it sure is getting a lot of opportunities.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading health experts are warning that the US could be on the brink of another pandemic, with bird flu now present in all 50 states and millions of poultry culled every week as a result&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The GVN is now calling on world governments to address the threat of H5N1 avian influenza by improving surveillance and implementing biosecurity measures &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, figures show since the virus was detected in the US in January 2022, more than 12,875 wild and domestic flocks have been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After&lt;span&gt; the virus spread to cows this year, it was diagnosed in 1,031 herds across 17 states - with the majority in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-d808d6d0-be4a-11ef-b15c-3b2cf3c0c1bd"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/colorado/index.html" id="mol-d80924f0-be4a-11ef-b15c-3b2cf3c0c1bd"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And 70 cases have now been detected in humans across 14 states this year, the most cases reported in the US in at least two decades. Before the current outbreak, the last human case of bird flu was in 1997.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no evidence any of the patients spread the disease to other patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the virus has been detected in unpasteurized or 'raw' milks, leading the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to announce that all companies handling raw milk will be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14166987/trendy-milk-tested-bird-flu-threat.html"&gt;required to share samples&lt;/a&gt; for testing upon request. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many experts, including officials at the World Health Organization, have criticized the US' response to the outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts have described it as a pandemic 'unfolding in slow motion.' Until the end of 2024, nearly all testing of cattle and of people exposed to infected cows were voluntary. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even now, mandatory testing is limited only to cattle moving between state lines.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cases have also been sporadically recorded in pigs, which has concerned researchers because these animals can catch both human and bird strains of flu - and could be 'mixing vessels' for a new strain of bird flu virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This map shows cases of the virus detected in wild mammals, such as red foxes and seals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And infections have been recorded among more than 400 non-bird wild animals in the US since May 2022, including red foxes, skunks, seals and raccoons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts warned these animals may pick up the virus after eating from carcasses of birds that had died from the bird flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wastewater surveillance for the virus has also picked up traces in 60 of the more than 250 sites monitored across the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In California and Iowa, more than 80 percent of samples have tested positive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US already has a stockpile of about 20million bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-b24635c0-bef7-11ef-b93e-fd05780f214b"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccines in its national stockpile, officials say, which are 'well matched' to the H5N1 virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also has the capacity to quickly make 100million more if necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are also supplies of antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) - which used to treat the latest US bird flu patient in Louisiana - available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still ongoing, is work to develop a bird flu vaccine for poultry and tests showing that human antivirals would work just as well on sick cows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Press release from the Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association is sponsoring a county-wide low-cost
canine rabies vaccination clinic. The Humboldt-Del Norte Veterinary Medical Association offers
these low-cost canine rabies clinics as a public service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that all dogs and cats be
vaccinated, as we have had several cases of rabies in wildlife and pets in Humboldt County as
recently as the last few months. Foxes, skunks, and bats are a few examples of rabies carriers.
We will be vaccinating dogs at the cost of $10.00 per rabies vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other canine and feline vaccinations will be available. The costs of these vaccines will vary with
the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, please contact the animal hospital you would be interested in taking
your pet(s) to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinic Schedule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, May 1, 8 a.m.-5 p.m.:&lt;/b&gt; Sunny Brae Animal Clinic
Saturday&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saturday, June 7, 8 a.m.-1 p.m.: &lt;/b&gt;Myrtle Ave Veterinary Clinic &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thursday, July 17,  8 a.m.-noon:&lt;/b&gt; Arcata Animal Hospital&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional clinics are available in Trinity County. Please call for dates and times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of several conditions, and it’s diagnosed in people who exhibit three of five conditions, including high waist circumference, low HDL (beneficial) cholesterol, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high blood triglycerides.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The prevalence of metabolic syndrome tends to increase as we get older. One study cites the rate at nearly 20% for those 20 to 39 years old but nearly 50% of those aged 60 and over.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Metabolic syndrome increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes—it also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increases your risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we often think of dementia and metabolic syndrome as being diseases of “old age,” there is evidence that these conditions may be on the increase in younger people. This connection and prevalence is an area researchers in Korea wanted to hone in on and learn more about. The research team published their findings in the American Academy of Neurology’s journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The goal of this study was to investigate the association between metabolic syndrome in midlife (ages 40 to 60) and the incidence of young-onset dementia. Young-onset dementia, also called early-onset dementia, is dementia diagnosed before age 65. The researchers also examined which components of metabolic syndrome are most strongly associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew their data from the Korean National Insurance Service, a government-run health insurance system in South Korea that covers more than 99% of its population. The services include regular biennial health checkups that gather clinical and lifestyle data, income levels and medical diagnoses. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After initially extracting data for more than 4 million people, researchers ultimately included around 2 million participants between the ages of 40 and 60 for this study who had undergone a general health screening in 2009. Participants were followed for an average of eight years. Just over half of the participants were men.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of the participants, just over 25% met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. This included having at least three of the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Elevated waist circumference: ≥90 cm in men, ≥80 cm in women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure: systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥85 mm Hg; or use of medication for high blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood sugar levels: elevated fasting glucose ≥100 mg/dL or use of oral medication for high blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood triglycerides: ≥150 mg/dL or use of medication for high triglycerides&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low HDL (beneficial) cholesterol: &amp;lt;40 mg/dL in men, &amp;lt;50 mg/dL in women; or use of medication for low HDL-C&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; About 60% of the metabolic syndrome group were participants in their 50s, and 40% in their 40s. Men made up over 62% of this group. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers gathered demographic and lifestyle data that were adjusted for during statistical analyses. These included age, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, regular exercise and income level. In addition, they also gathered medical diagnoses of the participants that occurred during the study period, focusing on dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After running several statistical analyses, results suggested that metabolic syndrome in people ages 40 to 60 was associated with a:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;24% higher risk of all-cause young-onset dementia—all-cause meaning all types of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12% increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21% increased risk of vascular dementia—a type of dementia caused by damage to the brain’s blood vessels, thus reducing blood flow and oxygen to the brain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also broke findings down for men and women. They found that men with metabolic syndrome had a 15% higher risk of young-onset dementia, and women with metabolic syndrome had a 34% higher risk of young-onset dementia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, being diagnosed with metabolic syndrome in the 40s increased the risk of young-onset dementia more than being diagnosed in the 50s. And while all the components (risk factors) of metabolic syndrome were associated with an increased risk of young-onset dementia, the risk progressively increased with the number of components present.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers pointed out several limitations of their study. First, they cannot say whether their results extend to people outside of South Korea. They also did not include other variables that influence young-onset dementia risk, like the presence of certain genes, family history of YOD, history of traumatic brain injury, hearing loss and education level. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note that they also lacked detailed behavioral (i.e. mental health) and environmental data, which can also influence dementia risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dementia is more than just forgetting someone’s name or where you put your keys. It interferes with one’s ability to think, remember, understand, communicate and reason.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Over time, it diminishes physical abilities, too, as the brain forgets how to do simple activities that used to be second nature. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While influenced by genetics, the components of metabolic syndrome may be a result of lifestyle choices. And they’re the same lifestyle choices that also influence your risk of other diseases, including heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and dementia. And many of these diseases and conditions are linked. For example, type 2 diabetes has been &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/link-between-dementia-and-type-2-diabetes-11704056" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;associated with an increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of dementia. And healthy cholesterol levels reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cholesterol-dementia-risk-study-11709528" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;as well as dementia&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Considering how all of these conditions are intertwined, it makes sense that there might be a common denominator. Scientists believe one of them is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, which can have several causes, including chronic stress, poor sleep quality, poor diet quality, microbiome imbalances and lack of physical activity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That means certain lifestyle changes can help on that front, too.With that said, nothing is perfect, and no one habit—or combination of habits—will guarantee you will be free of inflammation or disease. But evidence does lean toward people with healthier habits being at lower risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not sure where to begin? What habit are you most likely to see the quickest success in? For example, do you enjoy a walk or a trip to the gym occasionally? Maybe start there, gradually building a regular habit. Or if you’ve been wanting to branch out and try some new recipes, now could be a good time to add some tasty, healthy options to your arsenal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You might have a sleep disorder, like insomnia or obstructive sleep apnea, and they may be able to help you with specific strategies to help sleep come easily.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, this study suggests that individuals diagnosed with metabolic syndrome in midlife have a higher likelihood of developing young-onset dementia compared with those without metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle choices and habits play a huge role in disease risk. Start today by doing one beneficial thing for your health and then repeat it each day. Over time, small changes can become big improvements.&lt;br&gt;

There is no cure for either virus and both remain in the body, dormant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have to carry this virus for life; there is no medication available to treat it,' the woman lamented. 'There is only medication to relieve the pain, but the symptoms are recurring.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight years on, the amateur singer says she is still dealing with a range of uncomfortable symptoms associated with herpes, and the cold sores even &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14490535/Toddler-losing-eye-kissed-cold-sore-herpes-blind.html"&gt;made their way onto her cheeks earlier this year. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from Li.Lac, a tech company which makes a disinfecting device for microphones, warns that 'contaminated microphones can spread harmful bacteria or viruses, like the flu or other diseases'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'This is particularly concerning in settings where multiple people may be using the same microphone, such as in recording studios, theaters, and conference rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One woman claims that she got more than she bargained for after a trip to her local karaoke bar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In addition, microphones can harbor allergens and irritants that can trigger respiratory issues for those who are sensitive.'&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14490535/Toddler-losing-eye-kissed-cold-sore-herpes-blind.html"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;span&gt;HSV-1 - the virus which typically causes oral herpes - is quite fragile outside the body, and once saliva dries, the virus typically becomes inactive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The highest risk would be if you were to immediately use a mic that someone with an active cold sore had come into contact with and you have broken skin on your mouth that the virus could enter through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A report this year revealed that more than 846million adults worldwide are currently living with genital herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genital herpes is an exceedingly common and life-long sexually transmitted disease spread by two types of the herpes simplex virus (HSV).&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both types one and two can cause genital herpes. Type one typically manifests as cold sores, while HSV-2 is generally associated with sexual transmission and genital herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An international team of researchers sought to improve upon earlier methods to estimate the prevalence of both types of HSV worldwide in people under 50, starting with the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-bdcdbc80-b748-11ef-a27d-27fa2c0d4e7e" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;'s 2012 and 2016 estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers determined that the global prevalence of incurable genital herpes has been on the decline in recent years. Around 1 in 5 people under 50, or 846 million globally, are living with genital herpes, according to the latest estimates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both herpes simplex virus types one and two can cause genital herpes. Type one, which can occur at a young age, typically causes oral herpes (manifested as cold sores), while HSV-2 is generally associated with sexual transmission and genital herpes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More broadly, the research team determined that two-thirds of the global population – around 3.8 billion people – were living with any form of the more common HSV-1 in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020 alone, there were 122 million new HSV-1 infections in people from birth to 49 years old, including 16.8 million new genital infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And among people 15 to 39 affected by sexually-transmitted HSV-2, researchers identified 26 million new infections in 2020, bringing the total number of people currently living with HSV-2 to 520 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 20million Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9189567/One-five-Americans-STI-nearly-HALF-infections-people-age-24.html"&gt;test positive for sexually transmitted infections every year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 50 and 80 percent of Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5364293/Half-Americans-cold-sores-12-genital-herpes.html"&gt;get the occasional cold sore, while about 12 percent of Americans 14 to 49 years old have genital herpes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genital herpes causes painful blisters and open sores at times on the vagina, penis, labia, or testicles, but it can also be asymptomatic. Additionally, the herpes simplex family of viruses can lay dormant in the body without causing noticeable problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the virus infects a person, it may travel up to a cluster of sensory nerves in the brain and remain dormant there for months or even years after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in times of stress, severe fatigue, or changes to the immune system, the virus can reactivate, multiply, and travel back to the skin through nerve fibers. These stressful times can result in new blisters in the same area as the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People diagnosed with genital herpes are treated with prescription antiviral medications to make outbreaks shorter and less painful, but there is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 21:02:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxQX1laRkpfR0dGUVEyZFRwSWpqZ2U2UzRnRmhKSzNvWW9UZ3VmLWFrME0zeVdVY3RIa1JkcC1TMEdUWmVnMFZ3YUJuY1o1WlBsclRLeWIwTkU5Qzl1UFAwTmx6ZkVnQWpySmZ6ZER3UWphSmw2QWQ4OUVBSXp4SF82TUJIQWdoZnpoYjBYWlVWSkhSQXlONU5ic0JvOHFOakh1RkpDWjFXbzd6dnREQW5VUHJ5Z0dHTC1ieXRVTzVtakZBRVXSAcgBQVVfeXFMUGNLQ04tRHQ4Wl85Z09ucXNfdkRnOWF4RnRvV1B0VGktdTM5QlhZbDhaS01iTkxCQXprZjZhOERad0YxQlpUcmdaSzJmSExnRjNpRzJ2Q2lwbzNCNklqdGtkOENXcXJ1R2hGSENVbXpLNGU2Z1J3dkwtVl9xVUR5dHFWUmpyeWlKakNvcTg2TWhOck94YTlNQWV6RHVRQ281SFh4aFVPNnJwTFJHZnZSTW0zQ09yWU5ZbmItbDBJX2NUUW9LRTQyaHE</guid></item><item><title>无创脑脊髓界面可能有助于受伤后恢复运动-神经科学新闻 | Noninvasive Brain-Spine Interface May Help Restore Movement After Injury - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5ISHFvZ1FmRkZaZFZHSDJkOTBpRDNYRzEwU0hVMDlIRWh5eUFzekw5TWlwRmJhSXdCSkdJUTE0SFFUQ0k3R29hVWw2R0JXYTdoaEdCWXRFUVNNQWtsRUswdGV3OXdqNUFXQ1o2U3h3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have developed a noninvasive brain-spine interface that detects movement intentions and cues spinal cord stimulation to aid rehabilitation. Using EEG caps, they trained a decoder to recognize when volunteers either moved or imagined moving their legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This proof-of-concept study shows that imagined movement alone can reliably trigger spinal stimulation, opening new possibilities for restoring voluntary movement after spinal cord injury.

They found that the actual movement and imagined movement used similar neural strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After we give the decoder this data, it learns to predict based on neural activity whenever there is movement or no movement,” Seáñez said. “We show that we can predict whenever someone is thinking about moving their leg, even if their leg does not actually move.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used controls to ensure that the volunteers were truly imagining movement and not actually moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whenever people move, this can introduce signal noise, and we want to make sure that the signal noise is not what we’re learning to predict,” Seáñez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s movement intention or brain activity that we want to predict, so we have people imagine that they’re extending their leg and use the same algorithm that has been trained on people moving to predict whether they were imagining or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seáñez said this reveals two things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One, that it’s more likely that we’re decoding movement intention and not an artifact, or noise, and second, whenever we employ this on people with spinal cord injury who will not have that ability to actually move their legs for us to label the data, we could use their imagination of moving a leg to train our decoder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seáñez said the proof-of-concept study is a first step toward developing a noninvasive brain-spine interface that uses real-time predictions to deliver transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation to reinforce voluntary movement in a single joint in rehabilitation in patients with a spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the team plans to test a generalized decoder trained on data from all participants that could determine whether a universal decoder could perform as well as a personalized one and simplify its use in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this research was provided by the McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis; the National Institutes of Health (K12-HD073945, K01-NS127936; R01-EB026439; P41-EB018783); the Department of Biomedical Engineering in McKelvey Engineering at WashU; and the Department of Neurosurgery at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this SCI and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f29e819a9394949780b2858781869edc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leah Shaffer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leah Shaffer – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-025-01628-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Development and evaluation of a non-invasive brain-spine interface using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation&lt;/a&gt;” by Carolyn Atkinson et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development and evaluation of a non-invasive brain-spine interface using transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motor rehabilitation is a therapeutic process to facilitate functional recovery in people with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, its efficacy is limited to areas with remaining sensorimotor function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) creates a temporary prosthetic effect that may allow further rehabilitation-induced recovery in individuals without remaining sensorimotor function, thereby extending the therapeutic reach of motor rehabilitation to individuals with more severe injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we report our first steps in developing a non-invasive brain-spine interface (BSI) based on electroencephalography (EEG) and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to identify EEG-based neural correlates of lower limb movement in the sensorimotor cortex of unimpaired individuals (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 17) and to quantify the performance of a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) decoder in detecting movement onset from these neural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show that initiation of knee extension was associated with event-related desynchronization in the central-medial cortical regions at frequency bands between 4 and 44 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our neural decoder using µ (8–12 Hz), low β (16–20 Hz), and high β (24–28 Hz) frequency bands achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 ± 0.06 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7) during a cued movement task offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalization to imagery and uncued movement tasks served as positive controls to verify robustness against movement artifacts and cue-related confounds, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the addition of real-time decoder-modulated tSCS, the neural decoder performed with an average AUC of 0.81 ± 0.05 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 9) on cued movement and 0.68 ± 0.12 s.d. (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 9) on uncued movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that the decrease in decoder performance in uncued movement may be due to differences in underlying cortical strategies between conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we explore alternative applications of the BSI system by testing neural decoders trained on uncued movement and imagery tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By developing a non-invasive BSI, tSCS can be timed to be delivered only during voluntary effort, which may have implications for improving rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 21:00:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE5ISHFvZ1FmRkZaZFZHSDJkOTBpRDNYRzEwU0hVMDlIRWh5eUFzekw5TWlwRmJhSXdCSkdJUTE0SFFUQ0k3R29hVWw2R0JXYTdoaEdCWXRFUVNNQWtsRUswdGV3OXdqNUFXQ1o2U3h3</guid></item><item><title>多巴胺信号教导大脑消除恐惧-神经科学新闻 | Dopamine Signals Teach the Brain to Unlearn Fear - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBFdzJ5RTNFUFkteU1OZy10OTl6dTFQMkpDRG1ybUZHRDV4Sjhha094RVk5RWx0clJKcEFSZVhnZm80b1hZQ2V2Mi1CQy1GaE5Nd21ySkVKejQySlN0c0VzM0hmQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that dopamine release along a specific brain circuit helps extinguish fear by activating reward-related neurons in the amygdala.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research therefore pinpoints a potentially critical mechanism of mental health, restoring calm when it works, but prolonging anxiety or even post-traumatic stress disorder when it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dopamine is essential to initiate fear extinction,” said Michele Pignatelli di Spinazzola, co-author of the new study from the lab of senior author Susumu Tonegawa, Picower Professor of biology and neuroscience at the RIKEN-MIT Laboratory for Neural Circuit Genetics in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and an HHMI Investigator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Tonegawa’s lab showed that learning to be afraid, and then learning when that’s no longer necessary, result from a competition between populations of cells in the brain’s amygdala region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mouse learns that a place is “dangerous” (because it gets a little foot shock there), the fear memory is encoded by neurons in the anterior of the basolateral amygdala (aBLA) that express the gene Rspo2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the mouse then learns that a place is no longer associated with danger (because they wait there and the zap doesn’t recur), neurons in the posterior basolateral amygdala (pBLA) that express the gene Ppp1r1b encode a new fear extinction memory that overcomes the original dread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably those same neurons encode feelings of reward, helping to explain why it feels so good when we realize that an expected danger has dwindled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the lab, led by former members Xiangyu Zhang and Katelyn Flick, sought to determine what prompts these amygdala neurons to encode these memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rigorous set of experiments the team reports in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; show that it’s dopamine sent to the different amygdala populations from distinct groups of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study uncovers a precise mechanism by which dopamine helps the brain unlearn fear,” said Zhang, who also led the 2020 study and is now Senior Associate at Orbimed, a healthcare investment firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that dopamine activates specific amygdala neurons tied to reward, which in turn drive fear extinction. We now see that unlearning fear isn’t just about suppressing it—it’s a positive learning process powered by the brain’s reward machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This opens up new avenues for understanding and potentially treating fear-related disorders like PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetting fear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VTA was the lab’s prime suspect to be the source of the signal because the region is well known for encoding surprising experiences and instructing the brain, with dopamine, to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set of experiments in the paper used multiple methods for tracing neural circuits to see whether and how cells in the VTA and the amygdala connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found a clear pattern: Rspo2 neurons were targeted by dopaminergic neurons in the anterior and left and right sides of the VTA. Ppp1r1b neurons received dopaminergic input from neurons in the center and posterior sections of the VTA. The density of connections was greater on the Ppp1r1b neurons than for the Rspo2 ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The circuit tracing showed that dopamine is available to amygdala neurons that encode fear and its extinction, but do those neurons care about dopamine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team showed that indeed they express “D1” receptors for the neuromodulator. Commensurate with the degree of dopamine connectivity, Ppp1r1b cells had more receptors than Rspo2 neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine does a lot of things, so the next question was whether its activity in the amygdala actually correlated with fear encoding and extinction. Using a method to track and visualize it in the brain, the team watched dopamine in the amygdala as mice underwent a three-day experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day one they went to an enclosure where they experienced three little zaps on the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day two they went back to the enclosure for 45 minutes where they didn’t experience any new shocks –at first the mice froze in fear but then relaxed after about 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day 3 they returned again to test whether they had indeed extinguished the fear they showed at the beginning of day 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dopamine activity tracking revealed that during the shocks on day 1, Rspo2 neurons had the larger response to dopamine, but in the early moments of day 2 when the anticipated shocks didn’t come and the mice eased up on freezing in fear, the Ppp1r1b neurons showed the stronger dopamine activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, the mice that learned to extinguish their fear most strongly also showed the greatest dopamine signal at those neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Causal connections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final sets of experiments sought to show that dopamine is not just available and associated with fear encoding and extinction, but also actually causes them. In one set, they turned to optogenetics, a technology that enables scientists to activate or quiet neurons with different colors of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, when they quieted VTA dopaminergic inputs in the pBLA, doing so impaired fear extinction. When they activated those inputs, it accelerated fear extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were surprised that when they activated VTA dopaminergic inputs into the aBLA they could reinstate fear even without any new foot shocks, impairing fear extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other way they confirmed a causal role for dopamine in fear encoding and extinction was to manipulate the amygdala neurons’ dopamine receptors. In Ppp1r1b neurons, overexpressing dopamine receptors impaired fear recall and promoted extinction, whereas knocking the receptors down impaired fear extinction. Meanwhile in the Rspo2 cells, knocking down receptors reduced the freezing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that fear extinction requires VTA dopaminergic activity in the pBLA Ppp1r1b neurons by using optogenetic inhibition of VTA terminals and cell-type-specific knockdown of D1 receptors in these neurons,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists are careful in the study to note that while they’ve identified the “teaching signal” for fear extinction learning, the broader phenomenon of fear extinction occurs brainwide, rather than in just this single circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the circuit seems to be a key node to consider as drug developers and psychiatrists work to combat anxiety and PTSD, Pignatelli di Spinazzola said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fear learning and fear extinction provide a strong framework to study generalized anxiety and PTSD,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study investigates the underlying mechanisms suggesting multiple targets for a translational approach such as pBLA and use of dopaminergic modulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marianna Rizzo is also a co-author of the study.

However, the neurological nature of the teaching signal that instructs the formation of fear extinction memory in the &lt;em&gt;Ppp1r1b&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; neurons is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we demonstrate that ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic signaling drives fear extinction in distinct BLA neuronal populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that BLA fear and extinction neuronal populations receive topographically divergent inputs from VTA dopaminergic neurons via differentially expressed dopamine receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry recordings of dopaminergic activity in the BLA reveal that dopamine (DA) activity is time-locked to freezing cessation in BLA fear extinction neurons, but not BLA fear neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this dopaminergic activity in BLA fear extinction neurons correlates with extinction learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, using projection-specific optogenetic manipulation, we find that activation of the VTA DA projections to BLA reward and fear neurons accelerated or impaired fear extinction, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, this work demonstrates that dopaminergic activity bidirectionally controls fear extinction by distinct patterns of activity at BLA fear and extinction neurons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 20:27:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBFdzJ5RTNFUFkteU1OZy10OTl6dTFQMkpDRG1ybUZHRDV4Sjhha094RVk5RWx0clJKcEFSZVhnZm80b1hZQ2V2Mi1CQy1GaE5Nd21ySkVKejQySlN0c0VzM0hmQQ</guid></item><item><title>弗吉尼亚州扩大了对接触麻疹儿童的地区的警告-《华盛顿邮报》 | Virginia expands warning on areas exposed to child with measles - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQeVhSOGVNTzYtNDNiZlVObGpFZHNhb3VDWGNITnI1MHQ2bUFSRFlkUlIybWhNOHF0aklIckRfRG1qcEtFYTZOakttSUVzUThtTzlsREhCZ3J6SVZXblRtNC1ldnZxbXBlVDZrR2I1XzRPdEMxRWZiZXIyYUNPWTdZUWhpdWdSQ0M1QnN2VFo1ZkpFRkg4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2K2KGPARLJCYJGX4S5NHWVETCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Virginia public health officials on Monday released more detail on the areas in local medical facilities where people may have been exposed to a young child with the state’s first 2025 case of measles, a highly contagious disease on the rise across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ZA7ZVDSFRCPBM2AZ43K6NGKLQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The child, who was described as age 4 or younger, was contagious while visiting Kaiser Permanente medical facilities in Fredericksburg and Woodbridge on two days in mid-April, according to a statement from the Virginia Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B667WQMJURH6HOCIOY4BO4C2PY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/04/19/virginia-measles-northern-exposed-child/"&gt;The Virginia case&lt;/a&gt; stems from international travel, and not a measles outbreak in West Texas that has led to the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/06/measles-texas-death-outbreak-vaccine/"&gt;deaths of two children&lt;/a&gt;, officials said.

&lt;p&gt;The result could transform efforts to reach the three-quarters of children globally who should receive the vaccines but don’t. The shots prevent cervical cancer and also anal, penile, and some head-and-neck cancers. Worldwide, 350,000 women die from cervical cancer, the most common HPV cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think we can all agree that one dose and two doses of … these fantastic vaccines work really well,” said Aimée R. Kreimer, the NCI investigator who presented the new data here Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. “We’re really excited about these results.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, including the U.S., two doses of the vaccines are currently recommended. But in the clinical trial, whether one dose or two doses were used, the results were equivalent, according to the study of 20,000 girls between ages 12 and 16 in Costa Rica who were followed for 4 1/2 years. In all cases, the estimated efficacy of the vaccines was upwards of 97%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experts were fast to praise the results. Chyke A. Doubeni, chief health equity officer The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, called them “phenomenal” from the conference stage. He grew up in Nigeria and said he could imagine the findings could help expand access to more people in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Norman “Ned” Sharpless, who was NCI director in the first Trump administration and is now a managing director at Jupiter Bioventures, echoed those comments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think this is the most important cancer prevention trial going on in the world. We have a long history of failure in cancer prevention,” Sharpless said. “To have such clear evidence to support our practice is terrific and this will make the dissemination of HPV vaccine worldwide much easier and much cheaper to do — and it will save millions of lives.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The results could prove controversial not because of science but U.S. politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has long criticized HPV vaccines, particularly Gardasil, made by Merck, which is the HPV vaccine used in the U.S. Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1618279143468306435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;asserted on social media&lt;/a&gt; that Gardasil may increase the risk of cervical cancer, a claim contradicted by many studies. During his Senate confirmation hearing, he refused to disavow previous comments he had made questioning the safety of the vaccine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Children’s Health Defense, the nonprofit group where he served as founder and chairman for years, Kennedy&lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/victoria-trevisan-gardasil-hpv-vaccine-injury-merck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; filed more than two dozen lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the vaccine. During the nomination process, he promised to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/01/31/rfk-jr-hhs-gardasil-litigation-fees-divest-son-wisner-baum/"&gt;give any fees&lt;/a&gt; he earned from the Gardasil litigation to his son.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But from the start, the development of the HPV vaccines and studies of them could be traced back to the NCI, which is part of HHS. The institute’s deputy director, currently its highest-ranking official, is Douglas Lowy, who was a key figure in the development of the vaccines. He has won multiple scientific prizes, including the National Medal of Technology and Innovation and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, for his work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The NCI has also spent decades studying how to increase the uptake of hepatitis B and HPV vaccines as a way of preventing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

Kreimer celebrate the presentation of their HPV vaccine trial at the AACR meeting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Courtesy NCI&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, the HPV vaccines have had a dramatic impact. In the U.S., Kreimer said, they have decreased the incidence of precancerous cervical lesions by 80% — particularly impressive because only 77% of people in the U.S. who should receive the vaccine have been administered at least one dose. In the U.S. and other developed countries, effective screening against these lesions means that other types of HPV cancer, in particular head-and-neck cancer, are as common as cervical cancer. This is one reason vaccination is recommended for boys as well as girls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies across the world have affirmed that HPV vaccination does prevent cancer. In one &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/01/25/hpv-vaccine-prevent-cervical-cancer-cervarix-gardasil-study/"&gt;stunning recent example&lt;/a&gt;, Scotland said in 2024 that, of girls in the country who were born between 1988-1996 and had been vaccinated in time, none had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. Australia has said that it believes it can eliminate cervical cancer through vaccination and screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the United States, giving two shots of the vaccine has been difficult to achieve on a wide scale among adolescents — a reality that cancer prevention experts have long lamented. In 2019, only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6933a1.htm?s_cid=mm6933a1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;54.2%&lt;/a&gt; of adolescents had received two shots of an HPV vaccination. But these new data suggest that the picture is perhaps not as dire as originally feared.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In less developed countries, screening for cervical pre-cancers is far less common. These have always been the places where the HPV vaccines could have the biggest impact — but, because the vaccines are costly and because having to give multiple shots of a vaccine makes rolling it out more difficult in these countries — the vaccines have had the least impact there. In her talk, Kreimer said that only 24% of the girls who should get the vaccine worldwide do.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why showing that one dose of the vaccines is as effective as two could be so important. And much of this important work has come from the NCI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rolando Herrero, one of the researchers involved in the new study, was the lead investigator of a study that in 2007 first raised the prospect that fewer doses of an HPV vaccine could be just as effective. That study, the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, tested three doses of the vaccine Cervarix, which was the dosage used at the time. But 20% of the volunteers in the study received fewer than three doses, in part because there were contraindications to receiving other doses — including becoming pregnant. It appeared that those who received only one dose were protected from HPV just as well as those who were fully vaccinated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This flew in the face of vaccine dogma,” Kreimer said. At the time, researchers thought protein-based vaccines like Cervarix always needed at least two doses to result in a durable result.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the finding led to other research, including a study in India where a trial stoppage meant that many patients only received one dose of the vaccine. The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/11-04-2022-one-dose-human-papillomavirus-(hpv)-vaccine-offers-solid-protection-against-cervical-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;moved to recommend&lt;/a&gt; a one-dose HPV vaccine course. The U.K. also moved to recommend giving just one dose in 2023.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will not be much debate about using one dose in countries where vaccination has proved difficult. Kathrin Jansen, who led development of Gardasil at Merck and is now retired, noted that in a setting where people are not vaccinated one dose is certainly better than none.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s going to be any finding in the recent past that’s going to democratize cervical cancer control as much as these studies have,” said CS Pramesh, of the Tata Memorial Centre in Mumbai, from the AACR stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there is a question of how quickly the U.S. will consider moving to a single-dose regimen. There are still gaps in the data. For instance, researchers could want more follow-up on vaccine durability. And there are no data on other types of cancers HPV causes, particularly with regard to cancers of the mouth and throat. Still, in recent deliberations, the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has seemed open to a change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Merck’s recent earnings calls, the company’s chief scientific officer, Dean Li, pushed back against the idea that such a move would come quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I would just emphasize: we have had clear , firm, consistent, and recent guidance from the FDA on what  [they] would require for the licensure of a reduced dosing or a single dose. They are very clear on the high evidentiary standard,” Li said, according to a transcript. He added: “The FDA is incredibly up-to-date and aware of the limitations of existing trials, and none meet the criteria for them to have a label change.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kreimer pointed out that the benefit of change could be measured in lives saved.  &lt;br&gt;“Cervical cancer is a horrible disease, and outside the U.S., in lower-income countries, it is a death sentence the incidence is the mortality,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Better then, to keep the cancer from ever happening in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

When doctors received the results, they urged her to go to the emergency room immediately. She learned she had acute myeloid leukemia, an aggressive blood cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I felt so scared. I kind of blacked out,” she recalls. “I was like, ‘There’s no way she just said that. No way.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Sinus infection leads to cancer diagnosis &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While the months-long headache and pressure in her nose felt annoying, Hunter thought she simply had a sinus infection she couldn’t kick. When she struggled to walk up stairs or to class at Texas A&amp;amp;M, she became worried. At a follow-up appointment in October 2024, she shared her new symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I told them that the headaches are still here. I’m very weak and had fatigue,” she says. “They recommended doing a blood test.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter loathes needles, yet she finally agreed to undergo the testing after the doctor’s urging. When her results first came back, Hunter didn’t realize how serious they were. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The clinic staffer said, ‘Your levels are all over the place and it’s not looking good. (You’re) very anemic,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While they urged her to head to the emergency room, she only heard anemic and thought she could simply pick up iron pills at a pharmacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re like, ‘No no, I don’t think that will work,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter tried going to an emergency room close to campus but they were full, so she decided to drive home to League City, Texas. She had Googled her blood results and thought she figured out what was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was like, ‘Mom, I think I have leukemia,’” Hunter says. “She’s like, ‘Don’t say that. That’s not what you have.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she arrived at the emergency room, they admitted her and ran numerous tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had many people coming in and saying, ‘It’s looking like a sign of leukemia, but we’ll keep testing because it could be a bunch of other things,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-05-4c9bbb.jpg" alt="It felt tough spending so much time in the hospital while undergoing cancer treatments.

I was like am I going to survive this? Or is it treatable?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors transferred to MD Anderson in Houston, where Hunter underwent more blood tests for doctors to understand what type of leukemia she had and how to best treat it. She also underwent a bone marrow aspiration and a spinal tap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors determined she had high risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and she needed to remain in the hospital for treatment, which included seven days straight of chemotherapy infusions with a pill, which was part of a clinical trial. After 21 days, doctors tested Hunter’s bone marrow again to see if the treatment worked and she did a second seven-day round of chemotherapy with the pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I was supposed to get at least six rounds,” Hunter says. “The chemo worked so well I only had to do two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors believed she would do best with a stem cell transplant and her brother, Roy, 21, was a perfect match. After undergoing 11 rounds of radiation to kill any possible lingering cancer cells in her brain and spine plus an new intense round of chemotherapy, she underwent the transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I got a radiation/chemo burn all over my body, which was very very painful and I was pretty much burnt all over,” she says. The chemotherapy regimen “was harder than the leukemia one.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Following the transplant, she remained in the hospital for more than a month to make sure everything went well and protect her from potential infection from her weakened immune system.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Probably towards the end I was over it. I was like, ‘I can’t do this. This is too much,’” Hunter recalls. “It was very hard at times but God’s watching me. So, I knew I was going to be OK.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Acute myeloid leukemia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of blood cancer. It is actually one of the most common blood cancers in adults,” Dr. Courtney DiNardo, professor of leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, tells TODAY.com. “It can present quite dramatically with life threatening infections or bleeding problems or … blood abnormalities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-04-10ac64.jpg" alt="Navigating cancer treatment during her final year of college has been challenging for Breeze Hunter but having the support of her family, friends and boyfriend has helped her.

But you really have lost your normal immune system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In these cases, people normally do not improve after treatments for their infections and follow-up tests indicate something amiss with their blood cell counts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Not everyone presents that way,” DiNardo explains. “But it is one of the presentations we see — strange infections,” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The clinical trial Hunter participated in was targeted to the type of “higher risk leukemia” she had that doesn’t “respond well to standard intensive chemotherapy.” AML isn’t staged like other cancers and high risk or adverse risk is the most serious form that has “certain features that make them less likely to go into a remission and less likely to stay in a remission and be cured,” DiNardo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The response rates are low, and unfortunately, many people don’t survive,” DiNardo says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-025-02531-8.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Phase II investigation&lt;/a&gt; Hunter participated in is aimed at patients who have the same type of acute myeloid leukemia she has with a KMT2A translocation. Hunter received a chemotherapy regimen called FLAG-IDA with a pill called venetoclax. The pill is FDA approved for older patients who cannot handle powerful cancer treatments, DiNardo says. In Hunter’s case, she underwent an “intensive chemotherapy program with venetoclax added in as part of a clinical trial.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We are seeing such phenomenal outcomes, and this is not an FDA approved regimen yet,” DiNardo says. “We continue to expand this trial to enroll more patients and allow more patients to benefit.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hunter responded well to the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s doing fantastic,” DiNardo says. “Being a college student in the prime of your life getting dealt a life-threatening cancer diagnosis, I can only imagine how life altering and depressing it could be. But she’s always had such a beautiful spirit and good attitude.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;'It keeps me positive' &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While in the hospital, Hunter decided to document her experience. She even created a MTV “Cribs” type TikTok of her hospital room that went viral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We did it as a joke and I posted it and it blew up instantly,” she says. “I have never gone viral.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People shared their own experiences with AML or different cancers and Hunter met new friends that helped her navigate her experience with cancer. After the local news reported on Hunter, she met a young girl, Zoe, who has the same cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She’s 6 years old and she’s had a lot of side effects and problems,” Hunter says. “We’re best friends ... she is so young, and she has gone through way more than I have and it keeps me positive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;After the intense treatment, Hunter finally feels better. Her immune system is strengthening, and she will be able to walk in her college graduation. It will be the first time she can be around such a large crowd of people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’m so excited,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Having her friends and family’s support as well as a strong faith helps Hunter cope with her diagnosis. She’ll be on maintenance chemotherapy for the next year but then she’s looking forward to swimming and boating again. Hunter hopes her story encourages others to take their health seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/college-student-sinus-infection-leukemia-zz-250428-03-038bf5.jpg" alt="After the local news shared Breeze Hunter's story, she met Zoe, on the left, who is 6 and has the same type of cancer as Hunter.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote: 'Understanding how mortality patterns vary by birth cohort within each state can inform decision-making around resource allocation and public health interventions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average life expectancy in the US is 80 for women and 74 for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Monday in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833159?guestAccessKey=c0957767-f5eb-4d6d-88a4-15c747418b57&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=042825"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, collected mortality data from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics and calculated the number of deaths that occurred between 1969 and 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This resulted in 179million deaths in all 50 states and Washington &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-dc/index.html" id="mol-b6fecec0-2463-11f0-b9de-a9e256473e2a"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though life expectancy for men increased in most states, rates stayed the same as the 1990s for men in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/west-virginia/index.html" id="mol-2314a020-2460-11f0-9a11-571ce7507e68"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/louisiana/index.html" id="mol-2314a021-2460-11f0-9a11-571ce7507e68"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men in West Virginia lived to 70 in both 1995 and 2020. The same was true for Kentucky. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In New Mexico, men lived to 72 in 1995 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And women in Mississippi, West Virginia, Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas and Oklahoma all saw drops from the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Mississippi, for example, the life expectancy for women dropped from 76 to 75. West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Alabama each saw a drop from 77 to 76. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear exactly why these states saw decreases, the researchers suggested it could be due to increasing rates of poverty and chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, Mississippi is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13684195/South-state-diabetes-cancer-kidney-disease-healthcare-rank-Mississippi.html"&gt;the poorest state&lt;/a&gt; in the US and has the lowest median household income per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average household brings home $48,716 before taxes, according to World Population Review, significantly lower than the national average of $80,610.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poverty limits access to healthy foods, medications and regular doctor's appointments, increasing the risk of developing chronic conditions like obesity and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest CDC data, Mississippi has the second-highest rate of heart disease deaths behind Oklahoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And West Virginia &lt;span&gt;has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-12943237/West-Virginia-America-UNHEALTHIEST-state.html"&gt;consistently topped the charts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for rates of chronic disease. More than half of West Virginia's residents are obese, for example, and it has the nation's highest smoking rate of 23 percent. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The average life expectancy in the US is 77. Women have an average life expectancy of 80 while men are expected to live to 74&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Washington DC saw the greatest improvement in life expectancy from 1969 to 2020, jumping from 70 to 80 years for women and 61 to 73 for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due in part to Washington DC having the country's lowest obesity rate of 23 percent. Additionally, the researchers wrote the city's small population could make it more sensitive to statistical changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The city of 678,000 is also entirely urban, giving it increased access to healthy foods and healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also calculated the number of years it would take in each state for the death rate of people over 35 to double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This measures how quickly the mortality rate increases with age. The shorter the rate, the faster death rates surge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Iowa, the death rate for women doubles at age 43, the fastest rate in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Washington DC, however, the rate doubles for women starting at age 47, the study's slowest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Mississippi &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10499713/Mississippi-lowest-levels-life-expectancy-20-live-poverty-74-4-years.html"&gt;had the lowest life expectancy in 2020 for both men and women.&lt;/a&gt; The average age for men was 69, while women lived to 76. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following closely behind for both sexes was West Virginia with 70 years for men and 76 for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For women, Kentucky and Alabama tied for third-lowest life expectancy at 76.4 years. Arkansas and Oklahoma rounded out the top five, tying for a life expectancy of 77 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For men, Alabama and Louisiana both had a life expectancy of 70 years. Kentucky rounded out the top five with a life expectancy of 71 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Hawaii had the highest life expectancy for both sexes with 84 years for women and 77 for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due to low rates of chronic disease. The Aloha state had the second-lowest heart disease mortality rate in 2022, for example, behind Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Hawaii has the third-lowest obesity rate of 26 percent, outranked only by Colorado and Washington DC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations of the study, including a lack of data on how Covid may have altered the average life expectancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 19:14:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNZEpFODNIRjM5ZDVaS21YYVZKdTdFYlZYT2g5eUlILUZRLWNzdGtiTDMyQ2VzYml1SVdhZVpZdjc3dk1LY3p3WGphTEZ0MlJDbVZnQUtDNFBYdnMyTlRGR0poX21VNVdtVDJRclRvb1BCSWFyNENpZF9PQkxCemFrOWFwb25TNG80SmJuUnJxQ2JfWmNQakdVZzN4QWNzb2NaakV5SkZn0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9xaGZ1d0dXZU0zWlhVWVJyQVp2N3F0bGppRkVZS1V2T1dmNjBoTFdKTzFBdEM5eEpFNEphX1h2bWJYd1BROGxULUwtZVNTdjlQMldxeUNxU05mY21hZXBJMGtCdDJxbmhnRVdhMTIzTllwaWRFcUFMTnhPVXpYZmNLUWhQYTgwM1llczRwOFBKR29CZG41UVBCcDFNZUlHY1RadXp6LVhHQU45UQ</guid></item><item><title>当您服用Ozempic多年后，名人分享了JAB的副作用时会发生什么- LADbible | What happens when you take Ozempic for years after celebrities shared side-effects of jab - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOZnVWYWlBdmI4NGZoQlIxV2ltZ2lfRXo2cnVsRG5sQVVBbzE0UGRIVWg4V0xibnI5QVY1eDZad0I4MXNqNGFnelBkal94Nk1FLW80U2VDWkZQeUI5M3dWYUE0d01EcHYzNjJKUFBYMVhFNGJaWmZlM2hnX1NaSmdsSERGVHVZZlU3bDdvcmxNUUxSME1MSERkRlJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While Ozempic is still rather new when it comes to being taken as a weight loss drug, there are some people who've been on it for multiple years now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A whole host of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;famous faces&lt;/a&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK — As you add more ultraprocessed foods to your diet, your risk of a premature death from any cause rises, according to a new meta-analysis of research involving more than 240,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We looked at the risk of a person dying from eating more ultraprocessed foods between the ages of 30 and 69, a time when it would be premature to die," said study coauthor Carlos Augusto Monteiro, emeritus professor of nutrition and public health in the School of Public Health at Brazil's University of São Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that for each 10% increase in total calories from ultraprocessed foods, the risk of dying prematurely rose by nearly 3%," said Monteiro, who coined the term "ultraprocessed" in 2009 when he developed NOVA, a system of classifying foods into four groups by their level of processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group one of the NOVA system is unprocessed or minimally processed foods in their natural state, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs. Group two includes culinary ingredients such as salt, herbs and oils. Group three consists of processed foods that combine groups one and two — canned goods and frozen vegetables are examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Group four includes ultraprocessed foods. By Monteiro's definition, ultraprocessed foods contain little to no whole foods. Instead, they are manufactured from "chemically manipulated cheap ingredients" and often use "synthetic additives to make them edible, palatable and habit-forming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No reason exists to believe that humans can fully adapt to these products," Monteiro cowrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;2024 editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal The BMJ. "The body may react to them as useless or harmful, so its systems may become impaired or damaged, depending on their vulnerability and the amount of ultra-processed food consumed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Demonizing convenient, affordable and shelf-ready food and beverage products could limit access to and cause avoidance of nutrient-dense foods.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Sarah Gallo, Consumer Brands Association&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is misleading and will lead to consumer confusion, said Sarah Gallo, senior vice president of product policy for the Consumer Brands Association, which represents the food industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Demonizing convenient, affordable and shelf-ready food and beverage products could limit access to and cause avoidance of nutrient-dense foods," Gallo said in an email, "resulting in decreased diet quality, increased risk of food-borne illness and exacerbated health disparities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Just a serving a day matters, studies say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is not the first to find an association between negative health outcomes and small increases in ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;February 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found "strong" evidence that people who ate more ultraprocessed food had a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular disease-related death and common mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher intake of ultraprocessed foods might also increase the risk of anxiety by up to 53%, obesity by 55%, sleep disorders by 41%, development of type 2 diabetes by 40% and the risk of depression or an early death from any cause by 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the February study defined a higher intake as one serving or about 10% more ultraprocessed foods per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A May 2024 study found that adding just 10% of ultraprocessed food to an otherwise healthy diet may also increase the risk of cognitive decline and stroke&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; while 2023 research determined that including 10% more ultraprocessed foods was linked to a greater chance of developing cancers of the upper digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that as much as 70% of the U.S. food supply is ultraprocessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two-thirds of the calories children consume in the U.S. are ultraprocessed, while about 60% of adult diets are ultraprocessed," Fang Fang Zhang, associate professor and chair of the division of nutrition epidemiology and data science at Tufts University in Boston, told CNN &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;in an earlier interview&lt;/a&gt;. Zhang was not involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A global estimate of preventable deaths&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study&lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00072-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;, published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, took an additional step by estimating how many deaths might be prevented in eight countries with low, medium and high consumption of ultraprocessed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Premature preventable deaths due to the consumption of UPFs can vary from 4% in countries with lower UPF consumption to almost 14% in countries with the highest UPF consumption," lead study author Eduardo Augusto Fernandes Nilson, a researcher at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;(The study was unable to determine if the deaths were) caused by UPF consumption. The methods of this study simply cannot determine this.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Nerys Astbury,  University of Oxford&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to note that the study was unable to determine if the deaths were "caused by UPF consumption. The methods of this study simply cannot determine this," said nutrition scientist Nerys Astbury, an associate professor of diet and obesity at the UK's University of Oxford, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has the highest level of ultraprocessed food consumption in the world — nearly 55% of the average American's diet, according to the study. Researchers estimated that reducing the use of those ultraprocessed foods to zero would have prevented over 124,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In countries where consumption of ultraprocessed foods is low, such as Colombia (15% of the diet) and Brazil (17.4%), reducing the use to zero would have prevented nearly 3,000 deaths in the former country in 2015 and 25,000 deaths in the latter in 2017, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultraprocessed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness — and ultraprocessed foods is simply an innocent bystander.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Stephen Burgess, University of Cambridge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The authors set the theoretical minimal risk level to be 0. This implies a scenario where all UPFs are eliminated, which is highly unrealistic and nearly impossible in our current society," Zhang said in an email. "As a result, the estimated burden of pre-mature death due to UPFs could be overestimated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Burgess, a statistician in the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the UK's University of Cambridge, said that while the study cannot prove the consumption of ultraprocessed foods is harmful, "it does provide evidence linking consumption with poorer health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is possible that the true causal risk factor is not ultraprocessed foods, but a related risk factor such as better physical fitness — and ultraprocessed foods is simply an innocent bystander," said Burgess, who was not involved in the study, in a statement. "But, when we see these associations replicated across many countries and cultures, it raises suspicion that ultraprocessed foods may be more than a bystander."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 18:18:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQX2lsVnFSYzBlTnppZE5mWWNZSUhzZFh6SDZpbkJqRFlHUzZ5SFI4dVdqMUdwZjhBVW44aHpESHpubjhkSkNlTl9lemw5Y29mSF9kNUJodVd5V0NBRXN6UWYtd1Q5czZDR3h3T0dYTTc5OTZnU3oxWnVQOWxXa3dTbDNBYWVzcmxxaVluUlRDTjd1YVN5aTdyb3AwdU9GSUZpRDQxSXNtRko3NjU3QnFYTVlxaFl1ZUMtR25mbFpR</guid></item><item><title>您的肠道健康吗？警告标志和4种治疗方法- CNET | Is Your Gut Healthy?

Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut, and your overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome, Cresci said, since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="9b6a1bb6-9e58-4029-880a-000dc982ad63" data-ng-block="{"&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods to remove from your gut, or eat in lower amounts, include foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-heart-healthy-foods-to-add-to-your-grocery-list-this-week/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a1a52593-0492-4b02-b25c-5337ef955017" data-ng-block="{"&gt;2.

Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="bbe18608-a9f3-4775-bf43-d4b9a249e9e3" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3.

If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a data-id="64e83ed3-36a3-4d1d-90a2-0454068dfb22" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a target="_self" data-id="64e83ed3-36a3-4d1d-90a2-0454068dfb22" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too.

True, but so are eggs, pork loin and Brussels sprouts. That’s because they’re rich in choline, a nutrient related to B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VWEUT74FNFGCXIWDZYLUCHLHSE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Choline is critically important for a variety of body and brain functions,” says Ramon Velazquez, an assistant professor at the Arizona State University-Banner Neurodegenerative Disease Research Center in Tempe. It’s part of all cell membranes, and in recent years there’s been increasing evidence linking it to &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/mental-health/boost-your-brainpower-at-any-age-a1999739192/"&gt;better cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; and even a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease. But about 90 percent of people don’t get enough of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GNZCEQECOBH2BMVZCTENHJQQTU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GNZCEQECOBH2BMVZCTENHJQQTU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The memory effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DAF6AXK5QBB5PCV7RVDTJB2TIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The brain needs choline to make acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. “These [neurotransmitters] are chemicals that build and connect neurons [nerve cells] in the brain and body, and allow them to communicate with each other,” says Thomas B. Shea, a professor of biological sciences at UMass Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NAL4REGZLBF5PC35NFYD56S3HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research has found that levels of acetylcholine naturally decline with age and that people with Alzheimer’s disease have lower-than-normal levels. “The connection is seen both in age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s,” Velazquez says. “Lower levels of acetylcholine may affect your ability to form and recall memories, as well as affect word recall and focus.” A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8570899/"&gt;2021 study published in Behavioral Neurology&lt;/a&gt; found that people who got 188 to 400 mg per day of choline had a 40 percent reduced risk of experiencing low cognitive function than those who got less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4TN66PRMGBHARFXGAHNYJ72HJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some research suggests that specific types of choline may be more beneficial than others. For example, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522013375?via%3Dihub"&gt;2019 study involving almost 500 men, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, every 50 mg intake per day of phosphatidylcholine was linked to a 10 percent decrease in dementia risk. Eggs were the main source of it in the men’s diet. A large egg has 169 mg of choline, about 70 percent of which is phosphatidylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4CSLFF23WJBCBHVB7B74BBEIVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s even the potential that increasing choline intake after an Alzheimer’s diagnosis may help. “In studies of people with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease,” Velazquez says, “we’ve seen that supplementing with choline may slow the progression of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6M4OQNPZNZBDDORIQVSQKNG6XE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are other benefits to making sure that your diet contains plenty of choline. It plays a role in both fat and glucose metabolism. “Not getting enough choline can increase the risk of fatty liver disease, Type 2 diabetes and other metabolic diseases,” Velazquez says. Adequate choline may also protect against heart disease and strokes by helping to control the inflammation that contributes to those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="O6V6JZGXMVB3ND22P7O4WBWW2M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="O6V6JZGXMVB3ND22P7O4WBWW2M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How much choline do you need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GD3S6BP5KJFNBOGPVZII5POLBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Your body produces some choline, but it’s nowhere near enough to perform all of these critical functions,” Velazquez says. The Daily Value for choline is 550 mg, and that needs to come from food or supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3V2VNMOEBJC6BNGJ2PBCKUIUPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s not hard to get the choline you need through diet,” Shea says. Many foods contain at least some, and there are several that provide substantial amounts (see below). “But sometimes older adults start eating fewer calories or less variety of foods. In that case, supplementation may be in order.” Supplements can also be a good idea for people who eat a mostly plant-based diet because many of the foods highest in choline are animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZWX5G7P2R5H7LHX2BU533KCJAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You might not be able to rely on a multivitamin to help meet your choline needs, though; some brands contain little to none of the nutrient. If you’re going to take a supplement, Shea recommends choosing one that has about 300 mg. As with any supplement, you should discuss it with your doctor beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CNH5AYZILJB6NLVKDYZATXQF7M" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CNH5AYZILJB6NLVKDYZATXQF7M" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Top sources of choline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KY6JF7K2EVEMPDPM7KYEKVOXGU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can find choline in a variety of foods, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="NZEOLVL3TZHRLDVU75FK4MGYXA" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beef liver, 3.5 oz.

            As of 18 April 2025, a total of 2318 measles cases, including three deaths, have been confirmed in six countries in the WHO Region of the Americas, an 11-fold increase compared to the same period in 2024. The majority of cases have occurred among people between 1 to 29 years, who are either unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, most cases are imported or linked to importation. Measles is a highly contagious, airborne viral disease that can lead to severe complications and death. Although it is preventable with two doses of the vaccine, over 22 million children worldwide did not receive their first dose of the vaccine in 2023. This has contributed to a global rise in measles cases in 2024, which heightens the risk of imported infections, particularly from unvaccinated travellers arriving from areas where the virus is actively circulating.
WHO is working closely with countries in the WHO Region of the Americas to prevent the spread and reintroduction of measles. The regional risk is currently assessed as high, while the global risk remains moderate.
        &lt;/p&gt;

The cases have been reported from six countries: Argentina (n= 21 cases), Belize (n= 2 cases), Brazil (n= 5 cases), Canada &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1] &lt;/sup&gt;(n=1069 cases), Mexico &lt;sup&gt;[2] &lt;/sup&gt;(n= 421 cases including one death), and the United States of America &lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt; (n=800 cases, including two deaths).&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1: Epidemic curve showing confirmed cases of measles in the Regions of the Americas, by week 1 January- 18 April 2025 (n = 2318)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/measles-paho-epi-curve.jpg?sfvrsn=d8d9617d_3" title="Measles PAHO Epi curve" alt="Measles PAHO Epi curve" sf-size="61504"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2: Geographical distribution of the confirmed cases between 1 January- 18 April 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img sf-image-responsive="true" src="https://cdn.who.int/media/images/default-source/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/map-measles-paho.png?sfvrsn=44229178_3" title="Map measles PAHO" alt="Map measles PAHO" sf-size="743313"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview by countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Argentina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 16 April 2025, Argentina reported 21 confirmed cases of measles; 10 in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and 11 in Buenos Aires Province. Of these, three cases were imported, 13 were identified as contacts linked to the imported cases, and five cases are still under investigation to determine their epidemiological link to the transmission chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The index case was reported on 31 January 2025, in a child with a history of international travel. The second case, another child and a contact of the index case, was reported on 3 February 2025. Neither of the two cases had a history of measles vaccination, and both were laboratory-confirmed by RT-PCR. Following these initial cases, 19 additional cases were confirmed up to 16 April, with ages ranging from 5 months to 40 years. Two of these cases had a documented history of international travel. Only two cases required hospitalization due to pneumonia; the remaining cases were managed on an outpatient basis and are recovering well. Twelve of the cases were confirmed at the National Reference Laboratory of INEI-ANLIS "Carlos G. Malbrán," with genotype B3 identified. One of the imported cases, associated with recent international travel to Thailand, was identified as genotype D8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 12 April 2025, the Belize Ministry of Health &amp;amp; Wellness confirmed two positive measles cases—Belize’s first since 1991. The cases involved 17-year-old males from the Corozal and Cayo districts with no vaccination history, who travelled to Chihuahua, México, from 5 January to 31 March 2025 to attend a religious gathering. The onset of symptoms occurred on 2 April and 3 April 2025. Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for both cases and confirmed positive for measles on 12 April 2025. Thirteen close contacts who attended the religious gathering in Chihuahua were interviewed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) team and monitored daily for signs and symptoms. Despite significant efforts to increase vaccination coverage, Belize remains below the target range of 92-95%.  In 2024, Belize reported a country percentage of 83.9% for the second dose of the MMR vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brazil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 18 April 2025, Brazil reported five confirmed cases of measles across four locations: Federal District (1), Rio de Janeiro (2), Rio Grande do Sul (1), and São Paulo (1). The two cases in Rio de Janeiro are children under one year of age, both without a history of vaccination. The onset of symptoms was on 28 February and 2 March, 2025. The cases in the Federal District (symptom onset 1 March 2025) and Rio Grande do Sul (symptom onset 6 April 2025) are adults with a history of international travel. Additionally, an adult case reported in São Paulo who has a history of vaccination, and no history of international travel was reported with symptom onset on 4 April 2025. The source of infection for this case is currently under investigation.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 12 April 2025, Canada reported 1069 confirmed and probable cases of measles from seven provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. These far exceed the 177 confirmed and probable cases reported in 2024, representing the highest annual case count since the country achieved measles elimination in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority (83%) of the cases reported in 2025 are linked to a large, multi-jurisdictional outbreak occurring among unvaccinated individuals in under-vaccinated communities that sometimes interact with one another.  Between 27 October 2024 and 12 April 2025, 971 cases have been reported in seven provinces. The outbreak was initiated by an internationally imported case that attended a large gathering in New Brunswick in October 2024, which included attendees from multiple provinces. Most cases associated with this outbreak are either unvaccinated (84%) or have unknown vaccination status (12%). To date, only a small number of outbreak-associated cases have occurred outside the initially affected under-vaccinated communities, with no evidence of significant further spread beyond these communities.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, between 1 January and 12 April 2025, small numbers of localized outbreaks have been reported, consisting of two or more epidemiologically and/or virologically linked cases. These outbreaks are distinct from the multi-jurisdictional outbreak described above and have been directly related to internationally imported cases. During this same period, 16 measles cases in Canada have been attributed to international travel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mexico&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 January and 16 April 2025, Mexico confirmed 421 measles cases: two imported, 35 import-related, and 384 under investigation. Cases were reported in Campeche (n= 4), Chihuahua (n= 403, including one death), Oaxaca (n= 4), Querétaro (n= 1), Sinaloa (n= 1), Sonora (n= 5), Tamaulipas (n= 2) and Zacatecas (n= 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first confirmed case is an unvaccinated child in Oaxaca with a history of international travel between October 2024 and January 2025. The child arrived in Mexico on 29 January and developed symptoms on 10 February. On 14 February, the Oaxaca State Public Health Laboratory reported positive RT-PCR and IgM results for measles with genotype B3 identified. Three related cases were later confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On 20 February, the second confirmed case was reported in the State of Chihuahua in an unvaccinated child. The onset of symptoms was on 11 February, and measles was confirmed by the Chihuahua State Public Health Laboratory with positive RT-PCR and IgM results. The identified genotype was D8.  Following contact tracing and active case searches, 419 additional cases were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of cases were among those aged 25–44 years, accounting for 34.4% (n= 145), followed by children aged 5–9 years (13,5%, n= 57). In terms of vaccination history, 92.4% (n= 389) had no vaccination history, while 3.8% (n=16) had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, and another 3.8% (n=16) had received two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;United States of America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 17 April 2025, a total of 800 confirmed measles cases were reported by 25 jurisdictions: Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York State, New York City, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas (including two confirmed deaths), Vermont, and Washington. Of the total cases, 93% (n= 751) are associated with outbreaks (defined as three or more cases), with ten outbreaks identified so far this year. The outbreak in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma accounts for 82% of the reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children under the age of five accounted for 31% (n=249) of cases, individuals aged 5–19 for 38% (n=304), adults over 20 for 29% (n=231), and age was unknown for 2 % (n=16). The vast majority (96%) of the cases were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 1% had a single dose of the MMR vaccine, and 2% had received two doses. Hospitalization was required in 11% of total cases (n=85 of 800). Among children under five, 19% (47 of 249) required hospitalization. MMR vaccination coverage in children has decreased in recent years from 95.2% in 2019-2020 to 92.7% in 2023-2024.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious acute viral disease that affects individuals of all ages and remains one of the leading causes of death among young children worldwide. The disease is airborne, transmitted through the air or via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-14 days after infection, include high fever, rash usually accompanied by a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, cough and tiny white spots inside the mouth. The rash appears 2-4 days after the onset of fever and spreads from the head to the trunk to the lower extremities. A person is infectious about four days before and up to four days after the rash appears. While there is no specific antiviral treatment for measles, most people recover within 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is usually a mild or moderately severe disease. However, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, secondary ear infection, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), blindness, and death. Postinfectious encephalitis can occur approximately in about one in every 1000 infected persons. Measles also produces immune amnesia; a pathological process that makes the immune system forget how to protect against infections and leaves the infected individual more vulnerable to other infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines available. A two-dose schedule is 97% effective in preventing measles for life. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the declaration of measles elimination in the Americas Region in 2016, there was an unusual and consistent increase in confirmed cases of the disease from 2017 to 2019. In 2019, the region recorded its highest incidence rate at 21.5 cases per million population. This increase was largely due to large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil, which led to the reestablishment of endemic measles transmission and the loss of elimination status in these countries.  Between 2018 and 2023, the Americas Region reported 49 187 confirmed cases in 18 countries, resulting from the importation of viruses from other regions of the world and the resurgence of endemic transmission in Venezuela and Brazil.  The last endemic case of measles in the Americas Region was reported by Brazil in June 2022. By 2024, 465 confirmed cases were registered, all either imported or related to importation. That same year, the elimination of the endemic disease in the Americas Region was reverified.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In the WHO Region of the Americas, in 2025, there is an 11-fold increase in the number of cases compared to the same period in 2024. Although an improvement has been achieved in measles rubella surveillance indicators, there are still countries that do not meet the minimum notification rate of two suspected cases per 100 000 population, in addition to other indicators, in a homogeneous way. This could delay detection, notification, confirmation, and rapid response actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty in maintaining adequate levels of vaccination in the migrant population, vaccine-hesitant groups and other at-risk populations within the Region are big challenges. Given that several countries in Europe, Central Asia and Africa have areas of circulation of the virus, the identification of imported cases from these areas is expected. Intense migration from areas where the disease is endemic to areas where it is not could increase the risk of new outbreaks and cases. Considering population movement, international travel and mass gathering events, the risk of international spread cannot be ruled out. Travellers from regions with ongoing outbreaks can introduce the virus into countries with higher vaccination coverage, where there are still vulnerable populations, particularly infants who may not yet have received their first dose of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high due to several factors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Ongoing virus circulation from      imported cases has led to outbreaks with extended transmission chains,      secondary cases, and virus spread to new areas and countries in 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;Suboptimal vaccination coverage      persists across the region. In 2023, only 28.6% of countries achieved over      95% coverage for the first MMR dose (MMR1), and just 16.7% for the second      dose (MMR2). Regional coverage was 87% for MMR1 and 76% for MMR2. Data for      2024 is still being consolidated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-list="0" data-level="1"&gt;An increasing number of susceptible      individuals due to continued low coverage, driven by factors like the      COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine hesitancy, and limited access to healthcare,      especially among vulnerable groups such as migrants, displaced persons,      and Indigenous populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall risk of this event in the WHO Region of the Americas, especially in countries with low vaccination coverage, is classified as high with a high confidence level based on available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall risk at the global level is assessed as moderate due to the ongoing transmission in all the other WHO Regions, where immunization programs in several countries are not at an optimal level due to various factors, such as resource limitations, vaccine hesitancy, political instability, and health system weaknesses. These challenges have resulted in gaps in vaccination coverage, leading to widening pockets of the unvaccinated population and creating a pathway for measles to spread. This not only poses a public health concern for affected countries but also represents a potential risk for other regions due to international travel and population movement. The global risk of transmission remains a threat and particularly in areas with moderate or low vaccine coverage and could lead to new outbreaks in an unvaccinated population. This risk, coupled with gaps in laboratory systems and surveillance, outbreak detection and rapid response capacity, impedes progress towards global measles elimination goals and further exacerbates the threat of spread.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


        &lt;div class="don-content"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining sustained homogeneous coverage of at least 95% with the first and second doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and strengthening integrated epidemiological surveillance of measles and rubella to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases in public and private healthcare facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends strengthening epidemiological surveillance and preparedness and rapid response capacities in high-traffic border areas to rapidly detect and respond to suspected measles cases. Providing a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose and by implementing rapid response protocols when there are imported cases. Once a rapid response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national, sub-national and local levels must be ensured, with continuous and effective communication channels across all levels. During outbreaks, it is recommended to establish adequate hospital case management and infection prevention and control capacity to avoid health care-associated infection transmission, with appropriate referral of patients to airborne infection isolation rooms (for any level of care) and avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or other hospital rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends providing broad access to measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) or measles and rubella (MR) vaccination to maintain high vaccination rates of the general population and to ensure individuals at high risk of exposure are up to date on this vaccination, such as health and care personnel and international travellers. Individuals living in outbreak areas should follow local public health guidance. Globally, between 2000 and 2023, vaccination successfully prevented an estimated 60 million deaths (6 million deaths in the Americas) and decreased an estimated measles death from 800 062 in 2000 to 107 500 in 2023, which is an 87% decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO recommends maintaining a stock of the MR and/or MMR vaccines, and syringes/supplies for responding to imported cases. Facilitating access to vaccination services according to the national scheme to incoming and outgoing international travellers, including individuals due to perform activities, domestically or abroad, in areas with ongoing measles outbreaks, displaced populations, indigenous populations, or other vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO advises international travellers to check and update their vaccination status against measles prior to departure. Unvaccinated individuals from areas experiencing measles outbreaks, with knowledge of exposure to measles cases and/or presenting signs and symptoms compatible with measles virus infection, should consult local health authorities before undertaking an international voyage. At present, no additional measures that significantly interfere with international traffic are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;Tick season is upon New England — and some unexpected visitors have come up north to join the usual crew, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Massachusetts Amherst center has found and studied two ticks in Maine that are capable of infecting people with rare, possibly fatal, sicknesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New England Center of Excellence of Vector-borne Diseases, led by UMass Amherst microbiology professor Stephen Rich, scans residential backyards in New England as a part of an ongoing study in its third year to develop better practices for tick control, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-tick-researchers-identify-new-strain-rickettsia-bacteria-causes-spotted"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In one of the sets of properties that we looked at in Maine, we found some rather extraordinary ticks that we don’t usually see,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual ticks found in the Northeast are deer, dog, and human ticks that often carry Lyme disease. In this survey, which catches ticks by placing down a white cloth and then extracting them, researchers found a “preponderous” amount of uncommon rabbit ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, some of these ticks carried a unique, rare microbe called Rickettsia similar to a strain found in California that has led to people contracting potentially fatal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rocky-mountain-spotted-fever/about/index.html"&gt;Rocky Mountain spotted fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said that rabbit ticks don’t often feed on humans, but a likely scenario is that a more common tick feeds on an infected rabbit that can then transmit to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a low risk factor, but it is something that we didn’t know about until now, and it’s something we want to understand a little bit better and make sure that it is infrequent, and that it’s not something that has the potential to bridge over,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second case found does not cause disease, but rather an allergy — to red meat. Alpha-gal syndrome is becoming increasingly common in areas where the Lone Star tick, the usual culprit, is established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this year, alpha-gal syndrome has been found in &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/4/24-1265_article#:~:text=Maine%20CDC%20received%20positive%20%CE%B1,were%20%3E65%20years%20of%20age."&gt;57 residents in Maine&lt;/a&gt;, whose climate is not typical for the Lone Star tick. The allergy was recently found to have been linked to the black-legged tick after a woman reported being bitten by one and then developing an intolerance to red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding of not a tick but a patient that had alpha-gal … was what made that finding quite notable,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said the most effective way to avoid tick bites is to treat clothing with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553150"&gt;permethrin&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical that can kill ticks and other arthropods within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a tick does bite, the time it takes for it to infect a person differs from case to case, but Rich said the average time for Lyme disease to enter a person’s body is 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you take the tick off earlier, you can greatly reduce the risk of exposure from the stuff inside that tick,” Rich said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich said the finding of both of these “relatively rare events” within the same time period is likely due to there being more surveillance — the team is able to look “more carefully than we did in the past,” thanks to the study, which received &lt;a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/cdc-designates-new-england-center-excellence-vector-borne-diseases-umass-amherst"&gt;$10 million&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re doing the testing to provide impactful information to homeowners,” Rich said. “Because we’re doing that, and that wasn’t taking place before, we’re bound to make new discoveries of this kind.”&lt;/p&gt;

Those adding a little bit of&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/life-style/food-and-drink/cinnamon-products-lead-consumer-reports-b2614447.html"&gt; cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; to their sugar or hot beverage of choice aren't likely to have any issues, but consuming the spice in high doses could &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="/health-and-wellbeing/gemma-collins-mounjaro-wegovy-ozempic-b2737810.html"&gt;cause complications&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Health concerns could arise if excessive amounts of supplements are consumed without the knowledge of health care provider or prescriber of the medications,” Shabana Khan, a principal scientist involved in the study, said. “Overconsumption of supplements could lead to a rapid clearance of the prescription medicine from the body, and that could result in making the medicine less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary compound in cinnamon, cinnamaldehyde, can activate receptors in the body that actually breaks down certain medicines, researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noted in the study that cinnamon oil — typically used in cooking and for toiletries — poses no risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not the same for cinnamon bark. The study found that bark, especially that of Cassia cinnamon, a cheaper Chinese version of the spice, have the potential to cause medicine-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 kSitga"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/18/newFile-1.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="New research out of the University of Mississippi found that ingesting high doses of cinnamon could lower the efficacy of some prescription medications" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-27372"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;New research out of the University of Mississippi found that ingesting high doses of cinnamon could lower the efficacy of some prescription medications&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“True cinnamon from Sri Lanka carries a lower risk due to its reduced coumarin content,” the study's co-author Amar Chittiboyina, associate director of the National Center for Natural Products Research, said. “Coumarin’s anticoagulant properties can be hazardous for individuals on blood thinners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon typically carried in grocery stores is generally made of Cassia cinnamon bark, according to the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/27/health/popular-spice-could-interfere-with-prescription-drugs-study/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone consumes a significant amount of cinnamon regularly or has concerns about their cinnamon intake, they should speak to their doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khan said that anyone relying on medications to stay healthy should check with their doctors before taking supplements that could interact negatively with their treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who suffer from chronic diseases — like hypertension, diabetes, cancer, arthritis, asthma, obesity, HIV, AIDS or depression — should be cautious when using cinnamon or any other supplements," Khan said. “Our best advice is to talk to a health care provider before using any supplements along with the prescription medicine. By definition, supplements are not meant to treat, cure or mitigate any disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOZmozaGtyRzI2ZGhKbG16U0xmSHhrRW1pZjFjQzZDMW1uTEQ0YllkNVFfOE92SXNNUVhXcXFOT1gwM3lGdnJnaXh3VkdkMlZ2Vk5GWjFJX1FIa1F0ZW00ZkFsWktRQmxTbjdRZ285MlpjNEx0em5ldndENWdVdFZLTmhwSG9NZHhVTFJyY3Z6eTZxMzV6S0NCUmhBM3pwbHhSMDd3SjlGVTBEd0JSclJJ</guid></item><item><title>三名年轻女性在示巴医疗中心企图自杀，家人声称疏忽- Ynetnews | Three young women attempt suicide at Sheba Medical Center, families allege negligence - Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE45T0JVN3BYXzF3UjNQQ0dnbmNuem1peHBzM3JqOE9Qcm5IcU9MaERuOGYxWnVBMW8zU2NvVS1heDhIRzN0VnBsdVJ2RFdjUmRFWk55MVB0VExtUm1PakNfQWhQMTVqU2NaT1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Three young women attempt suicide at Sheba Medical Center, families allege negligence&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;Patients in their 20s hospitalized in open psychiatric ward survive suicide attempts, all within 48 hours of each other, prompting allegations of negligence from families and leading the hospital to close the ward and launch an internal investigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:39:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE45T0JVN3BYXzF3UjNQQ0dnbmNuem1peHBzM3JqOE9Qcm5IcU9MaERuOGYxWnVBMW8zU2NvVS1heDhIRzN0VnBsdVJ2RFdjUmRFWk55MVB0VExtUm1PakNfQWhQMTVqU2NaT1E</guid></item><item><title>格鲁吉亚男子因涉嫌在妻子去世前向其隐瞒HIV阳性状况而面临谋杀指控- AOL.com | Georgia Man Facing Murder Charges After Allegedly Concealing HIV-Positive Status from Wife Before Her Death - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFBNQ1JCSmdhWlNnclZ6Uzl0akZMdDdFQmMtaFNuamZEVTFONm5PM05DVmM4UWtYUEQ1YnVVZ1l6bHlkWU1UZGgyMGFSeU1XOVhLdmYtbHNjNDBSakFJcml4eEJ0ZXlCMFo5WWFMaFJjOXdhWmpBVHZJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta News First &lt;/p&gt; Cleveland Broadie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Georgia man was indicted by a grand jury on murder charges as prosecutors and family claim he did not disclose his HIV-positive status to his wife Denise, who was a cancer survivor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denise died in 2022, days after she was diagnosed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"At any time, he could have told her and given her the right to make the decision to stay with him," Denise's daughter said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Georgia man is now facing murder charges as prosecutors and loved ones claim he intentionally did not disclose his HIV-positive status to his wife, a cancer survivor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, April 21, Cleveland Broadie of Rockdale County was indicted by a grand jury on charges of malice murder and felony murder in connection with the 2022 death of his wife, Denise Broadie, according to CBS affiliate &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2025/04/22/murder-charges-filed-against-hiv-positive-metro-atlanta-man/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Atlanta News First;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Atlanta News First&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denise, who was 65, died two days after she was diagnosed with AIDS, according to both Atlanta News First and &lt;a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/rockdale-county-man-charged-murder-accused-infecting-wife-aids" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fox 5 Atlanta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fox 5 Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;, as prosecutors allege it was a result of Cleveland's “reckless conduct.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleveland has already pleaded not guilty to the reckless conduct charges. He has not entered a plea for the malice and felony murder charges, per Atlanta News First.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair wed in 2014, three years before Denise was diagnosed with breast cancer for the first time in 2017, according to both outlets. After she went into remission, the cancer returned in 2019, per Atlanta News First. The cancer eventually cleared once again following years of treatment, but Denise remained sick — with new tests ultimately leading to a 2022 AIDS diagnosis shortly before her death on April 2, 2022, according to Fox 5 Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/hiv-transmission-via-cosmetic-injections-vampire-facial-cdc-report-8639524" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC Reports First Investigation of HIV Transmission via Cosmetic Injections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC Reports First Investigation of HIV Transmission via Cosmetic Injections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlanta News First &lt;/p&gt; Denise Broadie&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleveland, now 62, was later charged with three counts of reckless conduct in 2023, after other women came forward, with investigators claiming at the time that he was aware of his HIV-positive status and had been taking medication for it since 2006, per a previous report from &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/07/19/man-charged-with-felony-reckless-conduct-not-disclosing-hiv-status/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Atlanta News First;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Atlanta News First&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Cleveland's initial charges, Denise's family continued to push forward with an investigation, as Fox 5 Atlanta notes, by hiring private investigators to look into his past and prove he was aware of his HIV-positive status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Rockdale County Jail's online records, Cleveland was initially arrested in July 2023 and booked again on April 16 of this year over the new arrest warrant/indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Young, Denise's daughter who described her mom as a family matriarch with a heart of gold, told Fox 5 Atlanta that she believes there was "malice" in Cleveland's actions. "At any time, he could have told her and given her the right to make the decision to stay with him," she said.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sydney scientists have revealed why receiving a booster vaccine in the same arm as your first dose can generate a more effective immune response more quickly. The study, led by the Garvan Institute of Medical Research and the Kirby Institute at UNSW Sydney and &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00407-6" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;, offers new insight that could help improve future vaccination strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vaccine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is administered, specialized immune cells called macrophages became "primed" inside lymph nodes. These macrophages then direct the positioning of memory B cells to more effectively respond to the booster when given in the same arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, made in mice and validated in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/human+participants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;human participants&lt;/a&gt;, provide evidence to refine vaccination approaches and offer a promising new approach for enhancing vaccine effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a fundamental discovery in how the immune system organizes itself to respond better to external threats—nature has come up with this brilliant system and we're just now beginning to understand it," says Professor Tri Phan, Director of the Precision Immunology Program at Garvan and co-senior author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientia Professor Anthony Kelleher, Director of the Kirby Institute and co-senior author says, "A unique and elegant aspect of this study is the team's ability to understand the rapid generation of effective vaccine responses. We did this by dissecting the complex biology in mice and then showed similar findings in humans. All this was done at the site of the generation of the vaccine response, the lymph node."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How vaccination site matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunization introduces a harmless version of a pathogen, known as a vaccine antigen, into the body, which is filtered through lymph nodes—immune 'training camps' that train the body to fight off the real pathogen. The researchers previously discovered that memory B cells, which are crucial for generating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibody+responses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibody responses&lt;/a&gt; when infections return, linger in the lymph node closest to the injection site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using state-of-the-art intravital imaging at Garvan, the team discovered that memory B cells migrate to the outer layer of the local lymph node, where they interact closely with the macrophages that reside there. When a booster was given in the same location, these 'primed' macrophages—already on alert—efficiently captured the antigen and activated the memory B cells to make high-quality antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Macrophages are known to gobble up pathogens and clear away dead cells, but our research suggests the ones in the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lymph+nodes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lymph nodes&lt;/a&gt; closest to the injection site also play a central role in orchestrating an effective vaccine response the next time around. So location does matter," says Dr. Rama Dhenni, the study's co-first author, who undertook the research as part of his Scientia Ph.D. program at Garvan.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Clinical study validates findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the relevance of the animal results to human vaccines, the team at the Kirby Institute conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical study&lt;/a&gt; with 30 volunteers receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Twenty participants received their booster dose in the same arm as their first dose, while 10 had their second shot in the opposite arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Those who received both doses in the same arm produced neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 significantly faster—within the first week after the second dose," says Alexandra Carey-Hoppé, co-first author and Ph.D. student from the Kirby Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These antibodies from the same arm group were also more effective against variants like delta and omicron. By four weeks, both groups had similar antibody levels, but that early protection could be crucial during an outbreak," says Dr. Mee Ling Munier, co-senior author and Vaccine Immunogenomics group leader at the Kirby Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you've had your COVID jabs in different arms, don't worry—our research shows that over time the difference in protection diminishes. But during a pandemic, those first weeks of protection could make an enormous difference at a population level. The same-arm strategy could help achieve herd immunity faster—particularly important for rapidly mutating viruses where speed of response matters."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the potential to refine vaccination guidelines, the findings offer a promising avenue for enhancing the effectiveness of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can understand how to replicate or enhance the interactions between memory B cells and these macrophages, we may be able to design next-generation vaccines that require fewer boosters," says Professor Phan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the University of California, Los Angeles, identified that comorbidities in midlife are associated with an increased risk of developing cancer and cancer-related mortality, with associations varying by cancer type. Chronic conditions were linked to higher cancer risks, offering insights that may inform prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Cross-disease communication, in which the diagnosis of one chronic condition accelerates the risk of a different subsequent disease, is receiving increasing attention. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cardiac events such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+failure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and myocardial infarction can stimulate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; and metastasis in mouse models of intestinal and breast cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical studies show that individuals diagnosed with heart failure or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/myocardial+infarction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;myocardial infarction&lt;/a&gt; face an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; compared with individuals without these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening bias remains a concern, as individuals diagnosed with cardiac conditions may undergo more frequent medical evaluations, leading to earlier detection of cancer. Broader evaluations across a range of comorbidities classified systematically are needed to confirm associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Comorbidity in Midlife and Cancer Outcomes," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832233" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers performed a secondary analysis of the prospective Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) screening trial to investigate how midlife comorbidities affect future cancer risk and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;A cohort of 128,999 adults aged 55 to 74 years was enrolled between 1993 and 2001 at 10 PLCO screening centers across the United States. Participants self-reported histories of 12 comorbid conditions, classified into five categories guided by World Health Organization taxonomy: cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver-related, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+conditions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a median follow-up of 20 years, only respiratory (HR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.02–1.12) and cardiovascular (HR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00–1.05) histories were associated with a statistically significant increase in overall cancer incidence. Metabolic, GI and liver conditions did not raise the pan-cancer risk, although each was strongly linked, positively or negatively, to several specific cancer types. Each comorbid condition was associated with an increased risk of at least one cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liver conditions had the strongest association with future liver cancer (HR, 5.57; 95% CI, 4.03–7.71). Metabolic conditions were linked to higher risk of nine cancer types and lower risk of four types, including lung and prostate cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory conditions (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.11–1.28), cardiovascular conditions (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04–1.13), and metabolic conditions (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05–1.14) were associated with increased cancer-specific mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings indicate that midlife comorbidities influence cancer development and mortality risk. Public health strategies focused on early screening and management of chronic conditions may help improve cancer prevention and outcomes. Formal integration of comorbidity screening into routine cancer risk assessments could support more personalized cancer prevention programs.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KENTUCKY, USA — Two cities in Kentucky are among the top 100 U.S. cities with the highest rates of Sexually Transmitted Illnesses (STI) this year, according to a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of Lexington has the highest rate of STIs in Kentucky, ranking 24th overall in the country, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.innerbody.com/std-testing/std-statistics#rounding-out-the-top-100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;study by Innerbody.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexington had 1,169 STI cases per 100,000 residents, 2,919 Chlamydia cases, 1,622 Gonorrhea cases, 223 Syphilis cases and 109 HIV cases, according to numbers from the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) latest STI Surveillance Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lexington had the highest rate of STIs in Kentucky, another city in the Bluegrass State had more cases overall.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other Kentucky city to make the list of the top 100 U.S. cities with the highest rates of STIs was Louisville, known for hosting the Kentucky Derby every year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louisville ranked 59th with 819 cases per 100,000 residents, 7,462 Chlamydia cases, 3,328 Gonorrhea cases, 313 Syphilis cases and 216 HIV cases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities in the U.S. South account for over 60% of the top 25 metropolitan areas with the highest STI rates in this year's study, with Louisiana home to three of the 25 cities with the highest STI rates and Florida home to two cities in the top 25.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Wednesday, a team of English surgeons and attendants arrived in the city of Leicester to be briefed on an upcoming surgery never before attempted or imagined in the history of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their patient was Vanellope Wilkins, the solitary survivor known to British medicine of ectopia cordis, a condition where a fetus develops with its heart outside its body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a period of 9 hours, the team which included visiting surgeons from London would form a protective cage around Vanellope’s heart by reforming her ribs, and though her team included some of the best pediatric surgeons in the country, the procedure had never been done before, and was invented specifically for Vanellope’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in November 2017, the child had to be kept in intensive neonatal care for the first 14 months of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requiring a large about of medical supervision, she is both autistic and nonverbal. Graphic imagery obtained by the BBC &lt;a href="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/774a/live/3188ea70-1b9c-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; Vanellope—her heart exposed in the center of her chest after it got caught and then fused onto her skin during development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ectopia cordis occurs in just a few babies per million births and has a low survival rate, and Vanellope required surgery immediately upon entering the world, a process which itself required 50 people to oversee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_217371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-217371" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-217371" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS.jpg 762w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS-326x305.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS-696x651.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS-449x420.jpg 449w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Miracle-baby-girl-Vanellope-Hope-Wilkins-SWNS-530x496.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-217371" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consultant pediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was there when it happened, and was one of the surgeons who recently stitched Vanellope’s heart back behind her chest bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’d lie if I say I don’t get nervous,” Dr. Patwardhan told the BBC on the morning of the surgery. “But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you’re doing something that will change somebody’s life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition, and now at 7 years of age, Vanellope has been deemed suitable for a permanent solution to her unique medical hazard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE INCREDIBLE MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="British Woman Gives Birth After Receiving Transplant Womb from Sister and Pro Bono Surgery at Hospital" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/british-woman-gives-birth-after-receiving-transplant-womb-from-sister-and-pro-bono-surgery-at-hospital/" rel="bookmark"&gt;British Woman Gives Birth After Receiving Transplant Womb from Sister and Pro Bono Surgery at Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Placed on a bypass machine, Dr. Patwardhan and his team detached her right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary artery from where they were attached to the skin, before breaking her ribs and reforming them in a protective cage around the heart’s new location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense of history and anticipation was present in the theater before and during the procedure, BBC reports. The operation was a success, and when the team was allowed to retire from the day’s work, they dubbed Vanellope “one of a kind,” in the truest sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE INFANT SURVIVORS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Baby Thriving After Doctors Removed Womb for Spinal Surgery–Then Put it Back Inside Mom at 26 Weeks" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/baby-thriving-after-doctors-removed-womb-for-spinal-surgery-then-put-it-back-inside-mom/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Baby Thriving After Doctors Removed Womb for Spinal Surgery–Then Put it Back Inside Mom at 26 Weeks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best satisfaction we derive from this is when you get a text message from the mom to say ‘thank you, you guys are amazing’,” Ikenna Omeje, another of the surgical team who also operated on Vanellope when she was born, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62gll2j86ro" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told the BBC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think personally, I have just done my job, but it has made a difference to someone and that is very satisfying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naomi Findlay, Vanellope’s mother, says that in the past, bringing her into the hospital has always been a frightful episode, but now, with her daughter recovering in the pediatric intensive care unit, she’s become quietly confidant, and can’t wait to take her back home to see her brothers and younger sister.&lt;/p&gt;

Groth said on Monday that Cole is expected to spend “at least a couple of months” in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, where he will be fed intravenously due to complications with his intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day gives us a bit more hope, so hopefully that continues,” Groth said. “You just never know, he could have a setback anyday… The surgeon [told us] we have to hope for some ‘boring days’ ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cole was born March 31 at New York-Presbyterian/Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital, with congenital cardiac issues. Doctors in the NICU placed a stent in Cole’s heart, after which the infant was considered “one of the healthiest babies on the floor,” his dad wrote in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-cole-jordan-groths-fight-for-life"&gt;a GoFundMe appeal&lt;/a&gt;. At 11 p.m. on April 14, two days before Cole’s scheduled discharge, medical staff asked Tim and wife Gabrielle – Cole’s mom – if they wanted their son to be circumcised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Long Island, New York couple agreed to the routine procedure, but claim no one ever told them that circumcision &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/HCQ.0000000000000113"&gt;presented a serious bleeding risk&lt;/a&gt; for babies with congenital heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 etWNXC"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/05/IMG_3486.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt='Cole Groth is expected to remain in the hospital for "at least a couple of months," according to his dad' class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-16500"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Cole Groth is expected to remain in the hospital for "at least a couple of months," according to his dad&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Courtesy of the Groth family)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything seemed fine for the first two hours after the circumcision, according to a timeline laid out by Tim on his GoFundMe page. Then, around 2:30 a.m., things took a turn for the worse. Cole’s diaper was “full of blood, stool, urine, so full that it had leaked onto the sheets and his leg,” the fundraiser says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hospital staffer alerted the nurse practitioner who performed the circumcision that there were problems, and the nurse practitioner rewrapped Cole’s penis with adhesive strips. However, Cole’s condition continued to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six hours later, unable to stop the bleeding, doctors intubated Cole, and shortly after 9 a.m., he received an urgent transfusion of 40ml/kg of blood. Babies of this age typically have between 80ml/kg and 90ml/kg of blood in their bodies, meaning Cole lost roughly half the blood in his body, according to Tim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the bleeding led to a frightening series of seizures, along with kidney damage, liver damage and neurological damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next three days, Cole seemed to be recovering. But, Tim said, at 4 a.m. on April 19, the hospital called and told him and his wife that parts of Cole’s intestines had necrotized and needed to be removed immediately. The 20-day-old baby was rushed into the operating room, where doctors rushed to excise the dead tissue, the family’s GoFundMe page explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JOhlJ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/28/15/26/Screenshot-2025-04-28-at-10-48-46-AM.png?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Tim Groth and his newborn son, Cole.

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists investigating an alarming rise in bowel  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="159331" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; in young adults have identified the bacterial toxin &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colibactin"&gt;colibactin&lt;/a&gt; as a potential culprit, with childhood exposure perhaps increasing the risk of later cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colibactin has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-08135-z"&gt;already been linked&lt;/a&gt; to this cancer type, but the relationship hasn't been specifically studied in people under the age of 50 before. It may go some way to explaining why bowel (or colorectal) cancer is on course to be the leading cancer-related cause of death in young adults &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.4708"&gt;in the next few years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing cancer tissue samples from 981 individuals across 11 countries, an international team of researchers looked for cancer-causing mutations in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"&gt;DNA genome&lt;/a&gt;. In more than half of the early-onset cases, these mutations matched up with damage caused by colibactin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRpOQEeXq44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These mutation patterns are a kind of historical record in the genome, and they point to early-life exposure to colibactin as a driving force behind early-onset disease," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; computational biologist Ludmil Alexandrov of the University of California San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is this exposure happening? The researchers aren't sure, but we do know that colibactin is produced by certain strains of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the gut, and the data suggests that the damaging exposure probably happens in the first 10 years of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more likely scenarios is that childhood infections are producing colibactin, which then damages DNA in the bowel. These harmful mutations then make cancer more likely later on, typically long after the colibactin has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, colibactin-related DNA mutations were 3.3 times more common in adults diagnosed under the age 40, compared to those diagnosed at age 70 or above. For cancer in older people, the DNA patterns were more often associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/extreme-heat-can-accelerate-aging-new-research-finds"&gt;normal aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If someone acquires one of these driver mutations by the time they're 10 years old, they could be decades ahead of schedule for developing colorectal cancer, getting it at age 40 instead of 60," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Alexandrov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has identified several associations that could be contributing to the rise in colorectal cancer at a relatively young age. Studies have pointed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-ultra-processed-foods-may-fuel-bowel-cancer"&gt;ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt;, and too many &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alarming-rise-in-cancers-of-the-gut-linked-with-these-deadly-diets"&gt;sugary or alcoholic beverages&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the suggestion is that lifestyle or environmental factors very early on in life may also be planting seeds of the disease. Further research is needed to know for sure, though with recent science funding cutbacks in the US, that research is by no means guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also want to take a closer look at how colibactin and its related DNA scars could be protected against, as well as how the different factors affecting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-dramatically-lowers-the-risk-of-bowel-cancer-coming-back"&gt;this kind of cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; may vary between countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's possible that different countries have different unknown causes," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/childhood-exposure-to-bacterial-toxin-may-be-triggering-colorectal-cancer-epidemic-among-the-young"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; computational biologist Marcos Díaz-Gay of the Spanish National Cancer Research Center. "That could open up the potential for targeted, region-specific prevention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump took office for his second term, thousands of health websites run by the federal government that kept the public informed about infectious diseases, mental health, vaccines and more were taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many eventually returned — in large part because a judge ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/11/us/politics/cdc-website-restore-pages-trump.html" title=""&gt;temporarily restore the pages&lt;/a&gt; — but some had been altered, with sections on topics such as health equity and teen pregnancy deleted. The changes, along with uncertainty around the future of these sites, has led some public health experts to question whether the websites can still be trusted as the gold standard of trustworthy health information, as they’ve long been regarded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Federal health agencies are already facing a crisis of confidence. When a recent &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;national poll&lt;/a&gt; asked respondents how much trust they had in the C.D.C. to make the right health recommendations, more than one-third replied “not much” or “not at all.” Nearly half said the same about the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts fear that with less trust in public health institutions, more people seeking medical information might turn to social media, where misinformation is rampant. That has made it all the more valuable for the public to find evidenced-based sources of health information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are five websites run by independent organizations that have accurate, easy-to-understand information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-357e41a8"&gt;1.

						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County will close temporarily April 27-May 2 for deep cleaning due to a recent outbreak of canine parvovirus (CPV).&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Although the adoption center on Petfinder Lane will be closed for the next several days, &lt;a href="https://spcawake.org/appointments/" target="_blank"&gt;the SPCA is still accepting online adoption surveys&lt;/a&gt;, and cat adoptions will resume on April 30.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;According to the SPCA, parvovirus is a highly contagious virus that mainly impacts dogs, especially unvaccinated puppies. Parvovirus attacks the gastrointestinal tract and can lead to severe dehydration or death if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County connected the outbreak to a litter of puppies that came to the SPCA from an overcrowded shelter in a nearby county. According to the SPCA, two puppies in the litter of six had parvovirus and are being treated. None of the puppies have died. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;People who recently adopted a pet exposed to the litter have been notified, and all exposed dogs are being monitored and quarantined, the SPCA said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus is typically spread through direct contact with an infected dog or through contaminated surfaces, food, water bowls or human hands. It can survive for months, which is why a deep clean is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The SPCA of Wake County shared steps pet owners can take to protect their puppies from parvovirus:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/spca-wake-county-parvo-outbreak-closing-april-2024"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/spca-wake-county-parvo-outbreak-closing-april-2024/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vaccination: &lt;/b&gt;Ensure your puppy receives the full series of vaccinations. Speak with your veterinarian about your puppy’s vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit exposure: &lt;/b&gt;Avoid public places, such as dog parks or pet stores, until your puppy is fully vaccinated. Parvovirus is easily transmitted in environments where many dogs gather.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good hygiene: &lt;/b&gt;Keep your dog's living area clean and disinfected. Use appropriate cleaners that are effective against viruses. Regularly wash food and water bowls, toys and bedding.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seek veterinary advice&lt;/b&gt; if your puppy shows any signs of illness—such as lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, or loss of appetite—contact your veterinarian immediately for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;

In fact, you might be surprised to learn that a new study published in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-024-46116-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiet-nutrition%2Fa64542423%2Fstudy-fiber-supplements-brain-health%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Communications;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that consuming &lt;strong&gt;prebiotic fiber supplements&lt;/strong&gt; can improve cognition by increasing good bacteria in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew via the growing body of existing research into the gut-brain axis that the potential was there to influence cognition via the gut microbiome,” says study author &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/mary-ni-lochlainn" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mary Ni Lochlainn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mary Ni Lochlainn&lt;/a&gt;, M.B.B.Ch., Ph.D., a clinical lecturer at &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kings College London;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kings College London&lt;/a&gt;. “However, we were surprised that our simple prebiotic was able to achieve a difference in a short 12-week intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the researchers find? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a quick reminder: Prebiotics are food for probiotics, &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health-products/g31040353/best-probiotic-for-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the famous good gut bacteria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the famous good gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; that aid digestion and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study included 36 pairs of twins ages 60 and older. (Studying twins helps researchers reduce the effects of differences in ages, genes and early life environments between study groups.) Half took a daily supplement of protein powder mixed with a prebiotic supplement made of inulin (found in garlic, artichokes and chicory root) and fructo-oligosaccharides (found in leeks, onions and asparagus). Their twins ate the same protein powder mixed with a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the 12-week study, the siblings who consumed prebiotic fiber improved their scores on a series of cognitive tests, on average, compared to their twin.&lt;/strong&gt; They made fewer errors on a test of visual memory and learning ability that can reveal early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease and dementia. They also had increased gut levels of Actinobacteria, especially beneficial &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might prebiotic fiber affect thinking and memory?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem far-fetched that this bacterial shift could change your brain, but researchers point to the gut-brain axis connecting the two organs. “We know our prebiotic led to an increase in &lt;em&gt;bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, which is thought of as a 'healthy' bacteria,” says Lochlainn. “We don't know the mechanism of how exactly this led to an improvement in cognition, but the gut-brain axis is connected in many ways, for example, direct nerve tracts such as the vagus nerve, hormonal signals other metabolites such as short chain fatty acids which communicate with the brain, and via immune pathways too.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could other prebiotics besides inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides — such as psyllium, the ingredient in many fiber supplements — shift gut bacteria to boost brain health? It’s plausible, says Lochlainn, but more research is needed since each fiber is unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, prebiotic fibers have plenty of perks, says &lt;a href="https://www.metabolicrds.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nina Olsen,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nina Olsen,&lt;/a&gt; R.D.N., L.D./C.D., the founder of Metabolic RDs.

Olsen suggests aiming for 25 to 35 grams of total fiber per day, including 10 to 20 grams of prebiotic fiber. If you're not there yet, add only 3 to 5 grams of prebiotic fiber per day and work your way up, says Olsen. If you consume too much too fast, you might experience bloating, constipation, or cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I explain this to my patients like a fish tank, where the probiotics are the fish and the prebiotics are the fish food,” says Olsen. “If you put too much fish food in, you're going to have a dirty fish tank and maybe a bunch of unhealthy fish. If you don't feed the fish as well, those fish are going to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g43067442/best-prebiotic-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:food sources of prebiotic fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;food sources of prebiotic fiber&lt;/a&gt; like bananas, garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus and artichokes. “Think &lt;em&gt;variety over volume&lt;/em&gt;,” says Olsen. “Rotating fiber sources builds a stronger, more resilient microbiome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're not getting enough fiber from your diet, a supplement can fill the gaps — and may even boost your brainpower. Supplements with psyllium, inulin, fructo-oligosaccharides or acacia fiber can be good choices. If you have a sensitive gut or a history of irritable bowel syndrome, Olsen recommends a partially hydrolyzed guar gum supplement. It’s a gentle prebiotic derived from guar beans.

In a carefully controlled experiment, healthy men who received testosterone showed amplified brain activity related to empathy for others’ inclusion and exclusion experiences, even though their self-reported feelings of empathy remained unchanged. These results suggest that testosterone may play a role in fine-tuning social vigilance by strengthening the brain’s sensitivity to emotionally significant cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is often described as the ability to understand and share the emotions of others, and it has been widely studied in the context of negative experiences like sadness or distress. However, researchers have paid less attention to how positive empathy—feeling joy for others’ successes—may be influenced by hormones such as testosterone. Most prior research has focused on whether testosterone impairs empathy, particularly for others’ suffering. Much less is known about how it might shape more complex forms of social responsiveness in both positive and negative emotional contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team sought to bridge these gaps. They designed a study to test whether testosterone affects both positive and negative empathy when people observe social inclusion or exclusion events. They also aimed to understand whether testosterone could change brain activity at rest, setting the stage for different emotional reactions even before social interactions begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My research initially focused on empathy, as it’s a fundamental part of how we connect and interact with others. Over time, I became curious about how biological factors—especially hormones like testosterone—might influence this process,” said study author Weiwei Peng, a professor at Shenzhen University and director of the &lt;a href="https://www.pcml.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pain Cognition and Modulation Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most studies have explored how testosterone affects empathy in negative situations, much less is known about its role in positive empathy, like sharing in someone’s happiness, which is key to social bonding. We designed this study to explore both emotional reactions and brain activity to get a fuller picture of how testosterone may shape empathy. These insights could ultimately help us better support people with conditions like autism or depression, where empathy is often affected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 35 healthy young men, ultimately analyzing data from 34 participants after excluding one due to equipment issues. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, each participant completed two sessions spaced about a week apart. In one session, participants received a topical testosterone gel, and in the other, they received a placebo gel. The order of sessions was randomized, and neither participants nor researchers knew which gel was administered at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three hours after the gel application—timed to match the peak effects of testosterone—the participants first completed a resting-state brain recording using electroencephalography (EEG), a method that measures electrical activity in the brain. They then performed an empathy task, viewing images showing people either being socially included, excluded, or in neutral situations. After each image, participants rated how pleasant they thought the person in the image felt, as well as how pleasant they themselves felt while viewing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although participants’ ratings of empathy did not change between testosterone and placebo sessions, their brain activity told a different story. When witnessing social exclusion, participants who had received testosterone showed a stronger early brain response, known as the N2 component, which is thought to reflect rapid emotional processing and threat detection. This suggests that testosterone made participants’ brains more sensitive to signs of social rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When viewing scenes of social inclusion, testosterone altered brain activity in a different way. Participants exhibited a stronger suppression of brain waves in the alpha frequency range—a phenomenon known as alpha event-related desynchronization—over the back of the brain. This pattern is usually interpreted as a sign of increased engagement with emotionally significant or rewarding stimuli. In this case, it indicates that testosterone enhanced neural responsiveness to positive social experiences as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone may tune the brain to better recognize both emotional pain and joy in others—even before we’re aware of it ourselves,” Peng told PsyPost. “Our study challenges the common view of testosterone as solely an ‘antisocial’ hormone. We found that it actually makes the brain more sensitive to both positive and negative social experiences, like feeling included or excluded. It didn’t change how empathic people said they felt, but it did make their brains react more strongly to emotional situations. That suggests testosterone could help us stay more tuned in to what others are feeling, which could have real value for people who struggle with social connection, such as those with autism or depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these immediate reactions to social situations, testosterone also influenced the brain’s resting activity. Analysis of EEG recordings during rest revealed that testosterone prolonged the presence of a specific brain state known as microstate E. This brain pattern has been linked to emotional processing and awareness of internal bodily states. Importantly, participants who showed a larger testosterone-induced increase in microstate E also tended to show greater emotional empathy during the social tasks, even though they did not necessarily rate themselves as more empathetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that testosterone may increase a baseline sensitivity to emotional information, making the brain more responsive to both threats and rewards in social environments. Rather than simply dampening or boosting empathy in one direction, testosterone appears to fine-tune the brain’s social radar, enhancing the detection of both positive and negative social cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One surprising finding from our study was how testosterone changed the brain’s resting activity—specifically in a brain state called microstate E, which is tied to internal bodily awareness and emotion processing,” Peng explained. “Testosterone made this brain state last longer, and that increase actually predicted greater emotional empathy in both positive and negative situations. It suggests testosterone may heighten our sensitivity to emotional signals by tuning how we internally process and monitor those feelings—even before we respond outwardly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results align with theories proposing that testosterone is not purely a “dominance hormone” but rather a flexible regulator of social behavior. In environments where quick detection of social threats is important, testosterone might help individuals stay vigilant. In settings where cooperation and bonding are beneficial, it may enhance sensitivity to affiliative cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers important insights, it also has several limitations. The sample was relatively small and restricted to young adult males, limiting the ability to generalize the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since testosterone is often labeled as a male hormone, our study focused on men, which means the results might not apply to women or older adults,” Peng noted. “Another limitation is that while we saw clear changes in brain activity, these didn’t always lead to noticeable changes in behavior. That suggests testosterone’s effects may be subtler or depend on the social context. Going forward, we hope to study more diverse groups and use more real-world social situations to understand the full picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these results by studying a broader range of participants, exploring long-term effects of testosterone, or combining hormone administration with behavioral interventions aimed at improving social functioning. There is particular interest in whether these findings could eventually inform strategies to support individuals with empathy deficits, such as those seen in autism spectrum disorders or certain mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testosterone is a fascinating topic, especially in the context of empathy,” Peng said. “We’re planning to explore how it interacts with other brain modulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and whether it could contribute to future interventions. This is particularly relevant for clinical conditions like autism or depression, where empathy is often disrupted. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how testosterone influences the brain’s empathy systems so we can help develop new ways to support emotional and social functioning in people who need it most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At our lab, we’re passionate about understanding how the brain processes pain and empathy. Personally, I’ve always been fascinated by how we recognize and respond to both our own and others’ emotional states. Our goal is to turn what we learn into real-world tools—interventions that help people better manage pain and build stronger empathic connections. By combining neuroimaging, cognitive neuroscience, and brain stimulation methods, we’re working to uncover how empathy and pain are wired in the brain—and how we can use that knowledge to improve people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2025.110465" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The role of testosterone in modulating positive and negative empathy in social interactions&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Shiwei Zhuo, Yinhua Zhang, Chennan Lin, Wen Wu, and Weiwei Peng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 14:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOdnJLMjVzemlSeGNYazJ3Mld2NVAxZVR4ZzJnODZUT21MU0hUekQtTlpJOTB0RjZ6NjY5am5KWmlWWDAxVksxLXY2RDZyRDVSZjZWaDBqeGNtd3lDVWt4V3VNSmtrcUFrby1TcVY1MGdwOEJSVlIyU2ZzOTJUa3poUDhBRTdRLS1DdWdaOGVuek84NVpkUFhMQlNRQzg0eW1pejhkRjd2aHdTT0FPUzBXS3dR</guid></item><item><title>循环呼吸法诱导与改善心理健康相关的意识状态改变- Medical Xpress | Circular breathwork induces altered states of consciousness linked to improved mental health - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQNGp0NEYyak9MT000eGp6S0JfZWRqNHFnUTdPSTY1d3hzbkxBdGt3cTRlQ2pwOXBOWElnbEs3T3NQanZYLXVlX0o0ckZqRkZ3MXJlRUU1UkhCRGEwNkx4WEZHbU13TktDbTZ1WjhTeDlfUnZOQm5paENObDFKRWhvakNrc3h4ZmRqSndWQlhBWVNrZ0hpdGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience, the MIND Foundation, alongside other collaborators, have found that reductions in carbon dioxide saturation during circular breathwork sessions were correlated with the emergence of altered states of consciousness. Altered states resembled those reported in psychedelic experiences and were associated with improvements in psychological well-being and reductions in depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Altered states of consciousness have shown promise as therapeutic approaches in treating &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health disorders&lt;/a&gt; such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Legal, medical, and financial barriers limit the accessibility of psychedelic-assisted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular breathwork practices, rooted in traditional techniques such as Tummo and Pranayama Yoga, and adapted into forms such as Holotropic and Conscious-Connected breathwork, may present a more accessible, non-pharmacological alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices involve continuous, deep breathing without pauses between inhalation and exhalation, often conducted in communal settings and accompanied by emotionally evocative music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early studies suggest that circular breathwork may alleviate stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD, while enhancing self-awareness and life satisfaction. Yet the physiological and psychological mechanisms underpinning these effects remain largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Decreased CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; saturation during circular breathwork supports emergence of altered states of consciousness," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-025-00247-0" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Psychology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted an exploratory study to understand how circular breathwork may induce altered states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 61 participants with previous breathwork experience took part at the MIND Foundation's premises in Berlin, and 43 participants engaged in either Holotropic or Conscious-Connected breathwork sessions. A randomly selected control group of 18 was instructed to breathe normally to distinguish the effects of active breathwork from the session's communal and musical context.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Mental health outcomes were assessed in a subset of participants using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, administered one week before and one week after the breathwork session. Due to incomplete responses, final mental health analyses included 25 participants who completed both pre- and post-session questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (etCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at six time points using a portable breathalyzer device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjective experience depth was assessed using hand signals, one finger raised for normal waking consciousness, five fingers indicating a deeply altered state of consciousness. Biomarkers of autonomic nervous system activity and inflammation, specifically α-amylase and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), were analyzed from saliva samples collected before and after sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reductions in end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure were observed during active circular breathwork sessions compared to passive control participants. Active breathers experienced significant drops in etCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, reaching as low as 16.6 mmHg, compared to an average of 34.3 mmHg in passive breathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decreases in carbon dioxide levels correlated with deeper altered states of consciousness, measured both through real-time hand signal ratings and post-session questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active breathers reported subjective experiences comparable to those reported in studies of psychedelic substances, scoring similarly on the Mystical Experiences Questionnaire and the 11-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Scale.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Psychological well-being scores improved one week after the session among the subset (n=20) of active breathers with complete responses. Participants showed reductions in depressive symptoms measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology and improvements in well-being assessed by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. Reductions in carbon dioxide levels and greater subjective experience depth predicted greater improvements in mental health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomarker analyses showed that salivary alpha-amylase concentrations decreased after breathwork sessions, suggesting reduced sympathetic nervous system activity, while levels of interleukin-1 beta increased, indicating a transient activation of inflammatory responses. Stronger altered state experiences were associated with smaller increases in inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that circular breathwork may offer a low-cost, non-pharmacological method for inducing altered states of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/consciousness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; that contribute to psychological healing. Decreases in carbon dioxide saturation during breathwork sessions appeared to facilitate the onset of these states, which were linked to reductions in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/depressive+symptoms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;depressive symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and improvements in well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an unregistered exploratory study with an incomplete cohort follow-up, any findings would require confirmation through more rigorous experimental design and execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Whether you hop on the treadmill and bump it to a 10–12 incline, or find a hill or staircase near you, you'll fire up your glutes, core, and legs way more than flat walking ever could, which means more calories burned. Plus, your heart rate stays elevated, so you're basically getting a low-impact HIIT session that won't crush your joints," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science confirms that walking on an incline is an effective form of fitness, burning more calories than walking fast or even running on a flat surface, so many experts suggest upping your incline. A &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3707880//" target="_blank"&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt; even found that walking on a 2- to 7-percent incline increased heart rate by almost 10 percent compared to running on a flat surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willis recommends the following workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 min warm-up at a low incline (moderate pace, can easily put out a sentence)&lt;br&gt;
17 min incline walk (challenge pace, where you're slightly out of breath but can still talk)&lt;br&gt;
1 min cooldown (flat or lower incline)&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be Consistent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Researchers found that neuroinflammation, trained innate immune memory, and cellular reprogramming may interact with amyloid and tau proteins to drive disease pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that Alzheimer’s may be partly an autoimmune disorder triggered by maladaptive immune responses to internal molecules. The findings offer new insight into how immune-driven inflammation could open pathways for future Alzheimer’s treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Role in Alzheimer’s:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuroinflammation and innate immune memory may initiate and sustain Alzheimer’s progression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Amyloid and Tau:&lt;/strong&gt; Overactive immune responses to amyloid-beta and tau could be key triggers of disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting dysfunctional immune mechanisms may offer new approaches for Alzheimer’s treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Temple University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain tissue analysis of an animal model reveals the potential role of immune system dysfunction in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published April 15, 2025 in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;, the new study uses RNA sequencing to demonstrate a link between neuroinflammation, innate immune memory, and cellular plasticity to AD progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109255"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an inflamed brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuroinflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This study expands the current literature by evaluating whether epigenetically encoded innate immune memory (trained immunity) and cell trans-differentiation also contribute to the disease cascade.

Neuroinflammatory processes, mediated by glial and immune cells, contribute to neuronal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence implicates innate immune mechanisms, including trained immunity and cell trans-differentiation, in AD pathogenesis, though their roles remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate transcriptomic changes in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, focusing on trained immunity and cell trans-differentiation in disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA-sequencing was performed on brain tissue (cortex plus hippocampus) from 11-month-old female 3xTg-AD and wild-type mice (n = 3/group). Differentially expressed genes (fold change &amp;gt; 1.5, p &amp;lt; 0.05) were identified and followed by bioinformatics and knowledge-based transcriptomic profiling. Public AD datasets were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;3xTg-AD mice exhibited 316 upregulated and 412 downregulated genes.

Upregulation of genes associated with cell migration and trans-differentiation suggests a potential role for inflammation and cellular plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, genes involved in inflammasome pathways, immunometabolism, and trained immunity were upregulated. Mechanistically, these genes were modulated by knockdown of trained immunity promoter SET-7, overexpression of trained immunity inhibitor IL-37, and knockout of inflammasome genes IL-1 receptor, caspase-1, and pattern recognition receptor CD36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding underscore the potential role of trained immunity and cell trans-differentiation in AD, revealing a mechanistic framework in which danger-associated molecular patterns drive innate immune responses, inflammasome activation, and cell plasticity contribute to AD, offering therapeutic targets for neuroinflammation and cellular reprograming.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 13:59:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1FcWxmbFVVQkZMS293N3RoQkhxOGRyeFNKcUUxakxjZ1VJOTZHZ3VHN2wzQTBzS3dRazNreHNKM2NTXzZHSkJWc0s4MXJ5N3JaZE1YbFp4ekRoanR1NmF1WEdTOXVIakFHMV9OTmZESms1Zw</guid></item><item><title>与精神病大脑变化相关的大麻使用障碍-神经科学新闻 | Cannabis Use Disorder Linked to Psychosis Brain Changes - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBHUlZrSkVKUU40alYzOTRrREdmWWJGVGNnN3RTUmlqeDk1a0RMZUVEdGlmdVZMWXo1WnlxcU02cF9NVmo5TVFJMVRyTEtRVVZpWDdOam5JNHNlTmFmVzltT21qOWd3LVNPUU5BbllQa1dYZGN1RVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that individuals with cannabis use disorder have elevated dopamine levels in brain regions associated with psychosis. Using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI scans, scientists found increased dopamine activity, visible as darker brain spots, in cannabis users regardless of schizophrenia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes suggest accelerated dopamine-related aging in the brain, helping explain the rise in cannabis-induced psychosis seen clinically since legalization. The findings highlight the need for greater public awareness about cannabis use and its potential mental health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine Spike:&lt;/strong&gt; Cannabis use disorder is linked to increased dopamine in brain regions associated with psychosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI revealed darker brain spots indicating excess dopamine in cannabis users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Concern:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may explain the rise in cannabis-related psychosis and underscore the need for informed cannabis use education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Western University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although it’s been six years since cannabis was legalized in Canada, further research is needed to fully understand its health effects. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published April 9 in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; sheds light on how cannabis use disorder is linked to changes in the brain that are associated with psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109251"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/psychosis-cud-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The neuromelanin appears in the scans as black spots, acting as a marker to measure and identify areas with dopamine activity. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using brain imaging techniques, researchers found individuals with cannabis use disorder, those who were using cannabis on a frequent basis over an extended period of time, exhibited signs of higher levels of dopamine in the same region of the brain that is tied to psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted in London, Ont., led by researchers from London Health Sciences Centre Research Institute (LHSCRI) and Western’s Schulich School of Medicine &amp;amp; Dentistry.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous data has shown that in emergency departments across Canada, people have been presenting more often with psychosis after the legalization of cannabis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have evidence that shows a straight line linking cannabis with dopamine and psychosis that has never been shown before, and it’s crucial that clinicians, patients, and families work together to break this line,” said Lena Palaniyappan, adjunct professor at Schulich Medicine &amp;amp; Dentistry, former medical director for LHSC’s Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP) and the senior author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter (a chemical messenger in the brain) that helps process motivation, mood, learning and motor control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excess levels of dopamine can disrupt normal brain processes and may increase the risk of psychosis, particularly in individuals who are already vulnerable,” said Betsy Schaefer, co-author of the study at LHSCRI and study coordinator at PEPP.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a non-invasive brain imaging technique called neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging, researchers were able to look at a substance called neuromelanin – a black pigment left behind in the brain that accumulates over time if there is too much dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neuromelanin appears in the scans as black spots, acting as a marker to measure and identify areas with dopamine activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In people partaking in excess cannabis use, those spots are blacker than what they should be for their age compared to healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This indicates they have high levels of dopamine, and in some cases are showing pigments someone 10 years older would have,” said Palaniyappan, who is also a professor at McGill University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-one participants aged 18- to 35-years-old were involved in this study. Researchers recruited individuals with and without cannabis use disorder, with some in each group also diagnosed with first-episode schizophrenia, who presented to PEPP at LHSC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We saw an increase of blacker spots in a particular region of the midbrain associated with psychosis –the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This increase was seen in those with cannabis use disorder regardless of whether they have first-episode schizophrenia,” said Ali Khan, Schulich Medicine &amp;amp; Dentistry professor and scientist at Robarts Research Institute.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“This research really helps to provide evidence, or the smoking gun, of what we’re seeing clinically and provides clues as to why exposure to cannabis is causing brain changes linked to psychosis.” – Dr. Julie Richard, psychiatrist and physician lead of PEPP at LHSC &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the last several years since legalization, we’re seeing adolescents who have two or three brief cannabis-induced episodes of psychosis and then have a much more major episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, we’re trying to counsel adolescents within that first episode that they’re pushing their brain towards a major episode and show them the areas in the brain that are impacted,” said Richard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaefer explained the new research helps clarify the biological mechanisms connecting cannabis use and mental health risks. The findings underscore the need for awareness, especially as cannabis becomes more widely used since legalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this study encourages further research and informs public health policies to support safe and informed cannabis use.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope these findings lead patients and health-care providers to better understand the implications and for the health-care providers to give patients resources for options other than cannabis to help them cope,” said first author Jessica Ahrens, PhD candidate at McGill University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cannabis use disorder and psychosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.westernu.ca/author/cyi8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cynthia Fazio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.westernu.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Western University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Cynthia Fazio – Western University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2832297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/a&gt;” by Lena Palaniyappan et al. &lt;em&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convergence of Cannabis and Psychosis on the Dopamine System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite evidence that individuals with a cannabis use disorder (CUD) are at elevated risk of psychosis and that the neurotransmitter dopamine has a role in psychosis, the mechanism linking cannabis use and psychosis remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), referred to as the &lt;em&gt;neuromelanin-MRI signal&lt;/em&gt;, a practical, proxy measure of dopamine function, to assess whether a common alteration in the dopamine system may be implicated in CUD and psychosis and whether this alteration can be observed in those with a CUD whether or not they have a diagnosis of first-episode schizophrenia (FES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longitudinal observational cohort study recruited individuals from 2019 to 2023 from an early psychosis service and the surrounding communities in London, Ontario. The sample included individuals with and without CUD, with some in each group also diagnosed with FES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FES and CUD diagnoses from the Structured Clinical Interview for &lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuromelanin-MRI signals within the midbrain (substantia nigra [SN]/ventral tegmental area [VTA]) including a subregion previously linked to the severity of untreated psychosis (a priori region of interest). Linear mixed-effects analyses were performed relating neuromelanin-MRI signals to clinical measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 36 individuals without CUD (mean [SD] age, 22.3 [3.2] years; 29 male [81%]; 12 with FES) and 25 individuals with CUD (mean [SD] age, 24.3 [4.7] years; 22 male [88%]; 16 with FES) participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-year follow-up was completed for 12 individuals with CUD and 25 without CUD. CUD was associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in a set of ventral SN/VTA voxels (387 of 2060 SN/VTA voxels, corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03, permutation test).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUD was also associated with elevated neuromelanin-MRI signal in the psychosis-related region of interest (&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;92&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.12, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .04) with a significant dose-dependent association (higher burden of CUD symptoms associated with higher neuromelanin-MRI signal, &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1, 96&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.89; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .03).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, participants with FES did not exhibit a significant elevation in neuromelanin-MRI signal (241 SN/VTA voxels had elevated signal, corrected &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .09). There was no association between time and neuromelanin-MRI signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated dopamine function in a critical SN/VTA subregion may be associated with psychosis risk in people with CUD.

Cells exposed to typical erythritol levels showed increased oxidative stress and reduced nitric oxide, potentially impairing blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mechanism could help explain previous links between erythritol consumption and higher risks of heart attack and stroke. While marketed as a healthier sugar alternative, experts caution that more research is needed to fully understand erythritol’s long-term vascular effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oxidative Stress Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt; Erythritol exposure increases oxidative stress in brain blood vessel cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Nitric Oxide:&lt;/strong&gt; The sweetener lowers nitric oxide production, impairing blood vessel dilation and blood flow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support earlier studies linking erythritol to increased risk of cardiac events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;American Physiology Summit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Erythritol, a commonly used sugar substitute often marketed as “healthy,” may impair blood vessel health by disrupting the brain’s ability to produce a critical compound, according to new research. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists will present their findings at the 2025 American Physiology Summit in Baltimore. The Summit is the flagship annual meeting of the American Physiological Society (APS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109247"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sugar-substitute-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In a new study, researchers treated human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells—cells from the tiny blood vessels in the brain—with erythritol. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol is a low-calorie sugar substitute found in many sugar-free products, including energy drinks, snack foods and protein bars. Like other sugar alcohols, erythritol is popular because it does not affect blood glucose and insulin levels as much as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, previous research links consumption of erythritol to a higher risk of adverse cardiac events, including stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers treated human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells—cells from the tiny blood vessels in the brain—with erythritol. They found that the cells exposed to the amount of sweetener in one beverage serving had higher levels of oxidative (cellular) stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the cells produced less nitric oxide, a compound that helps blood vessels dilate. Reduced nitric oxide levels can impair vasodilation, impair blood flow, and may increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While erythritol is widely used in sugar-free products marketed as healthier alternatives, more research is needed to fully understand its impact on vascular health,” said Auburn Berry, a graduate student at the University of Colorado Boulder and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general, people should be conscious of the amount of erythritol they are consuming on a daily basis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and brain health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ef8a9d809b87af9f87969c868083808896c1809d88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Erica Roth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://physiology.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Physiology Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Erica Roth – American Physiology Summit&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at the American Physiology Summit 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:59:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTFBIbTViOXdmTHRqZng4WjkyZ0IyV2t4elJBdEdxS3I2ZUZfdWhhLVdXY01Ib3ZIN0VhWklWcmtkZXRFN3VwUEtKVW83OWdrUTZBMXRFUEhmdHJXYUxoWUI2R3NUUWtfTmZ3OU5USXdKemlJRzQ</guid></item><item><title>脑机接口恢复语音获奖者- ALS今日新闻 | Brain-computer interface to restore speech named award winner - ALS News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNTG44NVFnNHFoTnNFWUJ0TXJLWTlWRWc4ck94b3VUSmtzVk9JU1VsR1FEMl9RY0ZuVVJnNXpnc0JhVS1WaXd0WVZTZ1M4SkFJOENyVDlpNnJ2VmtBbXNjVEdTZGpuNHJzMGo5NkNiOHZ0Z2Zka043Qm44VERxUURjX0JjbjVNMnIxVVA3UUdJQkxuRGpv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neurosurgeon and his team from the University of California (UC) Davis Health have won The Herbert Pardes Clinical Research Excellence Award — given by the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalresearchforum.org"&gt;Clinical Research Forum&lt;/a&gt; — for their work on a brain-computer interface that translates brain signals into speech with greater than 95% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The awarded clinical research study detailed the use of this &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/brain-computer-interface-man-als-communicate/"&gt;interface to restore speech&lt;/a&gt; in a 45-year-old man with &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/what-is-als/"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS) who had lost the ability to communicate using his own voice. The work also was selected for a &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalresearchforum.org/page/TopTen"&gt;2025 Top Ten Clinical Research Achievement Award&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It means a lot to us that our study was not only selected among the nation’s best published clinical research studies, but it has also won The Herbert Pardes Clinical Research Excellence Award!” David Brandman, MD, PhD, the neurosurgeon who led the study at the UC Davis neuroprosthetics lab, said in a &lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/welcome/news/headlines/brain-computer-interface-study-wins-a-national-clinical-research-award/2025/04"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award, which includes a $7,500 cash prize, is given to a study that shows a high degree of innovation and creativity in advancing the understanding or treatment of human disease. It is named after Herbert Pardes, a board member of the Clinical Research Forum, in recognition of his contributions to medical research and education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandman, an assistant professor in the UC Davis neurological surgery department, said his team is “very honored by this recognition.” The neurosurgeon codirects the neuroprosthetics lab with neuroscientist Sergey Stavisky, PhD, also an assistant professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim E. Barrett, PhD, UC Davis Health vice dean for research, nominated Brandman for the award. Barrett called the team’s work “nothing short of remarkable,” noting “the technologies they have developed offer real hope to change the lives of those who have been robbed of their power to speak intelligibly by diseases such as ALS.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Brain-computer interface wins $7,500 Pardes Research Excellence Award&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage to nerve cells in ALS leads to muscle weakness that gets worse over time. When the muscles of the face weaken, patients can &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/speech-problems/"&gt;lose the ability to articulate words&lt;/a&gt; or make themselves understood — a condition known as dysarthria — making communication difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/implantable-brain-computer-interfaces-could-help-restore-function-lost-als/"&gt;Brain-computer interfaces&lt;/a&gt; can translate brain signals associated with speech into text displayed on a screen, synthesize voice recordings, or even control external devices. This technology aims to enable individuals with dysarthria to communicate effectively and better engage with their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain-computer interface developed at UC Davis Health was implanted as part of &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00912041"&gt;BrainGate2 (NCT00912041)&lt;/a&gt;, a pilot clinical study ongoing at &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00912041#contacts-and-locations"&gt;five locations in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; The study is still recruiting an estimated 27 adults with ALS and other paralyzing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its main goal is to test the safety of this interface. Its use involves placing up to six small sensors in areas of the brain that control movement and speech. These sensors are connected to one, two, or three small connectors, called percutaneous pedestals, that pass through the skin. Brain signals are recorded through these sensors at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000201707#sec-2"&gt;An interim analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 14 patients, including six &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/als-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with ALS&lt;/a&gt;, showed that the interface’s safety profile was similar to that of other medical devices that stay implanted in the body long-term. Over an average of about 2.4 years, the most common side effect was skin irritation around the percutaneous pedestals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Casey Harrell, the man with advanced ALS and dysarthria who was portrayed in the clinical research study, a set of four sensors allowed him to communicate his intended speech within minutes of activating the brain-computer interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The technology is transformative because it provides hope for people who want to speak but can’t. I hope that technology like this speech [brain-computer interface] will help future patients speak with their family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some system training, starting 25 days after implantation, the brain-computer interface provided access to a 125,000-word vocabulary with an accuracy of up to 97%. This was achieved by recalibrating the decoder over the course of a dozen sessions.&lt;span class="Apple-converted-space"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time the study was published, Harrell said that being unable to communicate was “so frustrating and demoralizing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is like you are trapped,” Harrell said in an earlier &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/brain-computer-interface-allows-man-als-speak"&gt;news story&lt;/a&gt;. “Something like this technology will help people back into life and society.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry P. Selker, MD, chair of the clinical research forum and dean of Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute at Tufts University, noted that Harrell was “actually able to speak using recordings of his own voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This study is spectacular,” Selker said, noting that it allowed Harrell to “communicate with his family and maintain his livelihood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandman said the team’s study “demonstrates the most accurate speech neuroprosthesis (device) ever reported. The technology is transformative because it provides hope for people who want to speak but can’t. I hope that technology like this speech [brain-computer interface] will help future patients speak with their family and friends.”&lt;/p&gt;

Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The report estimates that in the UK and the US, where UPFs account for more than half of calorie intake, 14% of early deaths could be linked to the harms they cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In countries such as Colombia and Brazil, where UPF intake is much lower (less than 20% of calorie intake), the study estimated these foods are linked to around 4% of premature deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lead study author Dr Eduardo Nilson, from Brazil, said UPFs affected health "because of the changes in the foods during industrial processing and the use of artificial ingredients, including colorants, artificial flavours and sweeteners, emulsifiers, and many other additives and processing aids".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By their calculations, in the US in 2018, there were 124,000 premature deaths due to the consumption of ultra-processed food.

But when numerous studies across many countries and culture suggest UPFs could be a risk to health, Dr Burgess says "ultra-processed foods may be more than a bystander".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said the term 'ultra-processed food' "demonises a wide variety of food that can help people achieve a healthy balanced diet, such as yoghurt, pasta sauces or bread". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It said all additives used by food manufacturers are approved by the Food Standards Agency, who ensure they are safe to eat and drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:47:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5jUm5hazRncUZ4T2JQTDdFMUZLaGlHYW1RU3ZCV25SamctUkwtbHM4VmgySW1BR2hYb1dJVjJtc1A3VGRnbzNwUEE4ZHQ4MHZVa3AxQ2FoMXROd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5FT0diYWFieG1sTGpRU293Z0JYcVhwYlFxemJGb0VvLVh1MDFVUjN4dnE3NEtaUk85d0NNS2NNeFlzbVlSVVowc2diLXJ3Rkt0Q3k4Wmt6NUdoRmI0ellF</guid></item><item><title>我的儿子将他的性取向作为他整个生命的秘密。我害怕它帮助杀了他。-赫芬顿邮报 | My Son Kept His Sexuality A Secret His Whole Life.

When my phone woke me, I saw it was my 23-year-old son, Kyle, calling from the other side of the country at 4 a.m. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a queer person, I thought I had pretty good gaydar, and I imagined my son and I were close, yet his revelation left me open-mouthed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d never had the slightest inkling Kyle might be gay. He’d always had crushes on girls, starting with little Kathy on his favorite toddler show, ”&lt;/span&gt;Barney &amp;amp; Friends&lt;span&gt;.” He’d pined over girls in middle and high school and worried over the phone with me about his relationships with girls in college. Now he was calling me from Seattle, where he’d moved for love after following a woman from New York. Never once had he expressed sexual interest in men. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I tried to respond with sensitivity and support. Yet I could barely muster any affirming words — especially when Kyle revealed that when he was 16, he’d started arranging online encounters with grown men who met him in a local park for blowjobs. While I fought back my horror over how unaware I’d been that my young son had been meeting with adult predators, Kyle told me he was wondering if he might really have been gay — or maybe bi — all his life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I could not have been more shocked, or so I thought, until the other reason he’d called became clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think maybe I’ve turned to drugs because I’ve been afraid to admit I’m gay,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I soon realized Kyle was calling for help. He’d been arrested for pot and “party drugs,” such as mushrooms and ecstasy, in high school and college, but had seemed to be doing well the prior two years. He now confessed he’d “tried” crack cocaine and become so uncontrollably addicted he’d spent all his student loan money on the drug and was holed up alone in his apartment, high out of his mind after trading away his PlayStation to get more. He was calling because he was afraid he was about to start trading away his roommates’ electronics too. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Questions about his sexuality fell by the wayside. I suspected he’d only told me about his attraction to men because that felt easier than announcing his addiction to crack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I found a rehab that would take him, I cried with relief, thinking all of our problems would now be solved. Instead his fellow rehab residents told Kyle about the ultimate high, heroin, which Kyle later told me he “knew immediately” he’d have to try. A friend from long-term rehab helped him shoot up for the first time a year later, and he spent the remainder of his too-short life in and out of rehabs and halfway houses. He died tragically of an overdose of heroin and meth when he was 26. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle was a poet who wrote love sonnets. He was a thoughtful gift-giver who bought the best presents. He earned the highest score of any student in his high school on that year’s SATs. He did children’s theater and stand-up comedy. He loved to play games and beat me at Scrabble nearly every time. He was an extreme romantic who once filled a car with balloons for a girl’s birthday. Yet as Kyle stepped into his role as a young man, he engaged in ever more reckless behaviors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Kyle as a camp counselor when he was 18. He and his girlfriend wore one another's clothes for a camp talent show.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Lanette Sweeney"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Lanette Sweeney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He told me he did LSD 45 times in high school. When he got his driver’s license, he drove his car 100 miles an hour up and off a hilly road in order to “catch air,” slamming himself and his best friend into a tree. (Both boys miraculously walked away unharmed, no doubt increasing their belief in their own invincibility.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle was not born a risk taker; he was shy and timid as a toddler. Yet as he grew up, he repeatedly risked his safety to prove how tough he was. A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222499/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="2010 study," data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68070fe5e4b052543c13cab5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3222499/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2010 study,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; “Gender Disparities in Injury Mortality: Consistent, Persistent, and Larger Than You’d Think,” explains &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;boys and men are two to three times more likely than girls and women to die&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; violently and suddenly by injury, accident, homicide, suicide and drug overdose. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/invisible-majority.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research overview compiled by a nonprofit think tank" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68070fe5e4b052543c13cab5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/invisible-majority.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research overview compiled by a nonprofit think tank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2016 found bisexuals are more likely to have mental health issues, attempt and commit suicide, suffer from major depression, and have problems with binge-drinking than either gay or straight people. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bi people may have the most trouble with self-acceptance and often are the most lacking in community, since they may feel rejected by both the gay and straight communities. Nearly three-quarters of gay and lesbian people are “out” to family and friends, but fewer than a third of bisexual people are, leaving them isolated and unsupported. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle was a brilliant, sensitive young man, yet what he wanted more than anything was to fit in as one of the guys, which led him to engage in ever-more-troubling behaviors. Indeed, he seemed more concerned with impressing people with his machismo than many of his peers. I now wonder if this was at least partly because of his shame over his sexuality; was he overcompensating to make sure no one suspected?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite all his outrageous, attention-seeking behavior, my son guarded his one secret closely. While publicly dating girls in high school, he was having multiple secret, sexual encounters with grown men, encounters I consider child abuse, but which may have been the only way my son knew to explore his sexuality without anyone finding out. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle’s secrecy about his sexuality is even more puzzling because I am queer. I had a girlfriend in high school, then was married to a man for 20 years and am now married to a woman. Kyle’s sister is also queer, an identity Kyle encouraged her to embrace with pride. Our family is about as accepting as a family can be, which made it all the more shocking when Kyle came out to me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, he reminded me during that phone call that I’d idiotically told him and his sister I didn’t believe men &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;could &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;be bisexual, which Kyle explained was why he’d never discussed his sexuality with me. He feared I’d insist he was gay, which he didn’t really think he was. (He wound up concluding that night that he was in fact bi, not gay, though he found “bi” harder to say.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My unknowing rejection of my son’s identity is a mistake I have the rest of my life to regret. But a study published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/31/18369" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68070fe5e4b052543c13cab5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/31/18369" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;suggests my disbelief is sadly common. The article begins, “There has long been skepticism among both scientists and laypersons that male bisexual orientation exists. Skeptics have claimed men who self-identify as bisexual are actually homosexual or heterosexual. (The existence of female bisexuality has been less controversial.)”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Kyle in his last rehab, less than a year before he died.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo Courtesy Of Lanette Sweeney"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo Courtesy Of Lanette Sweeney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kyle needed mental health support for the shame society made him feel about being bisexual as much as he did for his addiction, but we only focused on what seemed like the more life-threatening problem, his substance-use disorder. Further, many therapies in rehab are done in groups, and Kyle never felt comfortable discussing his sexuality in those hyper-masculine, gender-segregated rooms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We tried to get Kyle to talk further about this, but he resisted, insisting he was “mostly straight.” He appreciated that I revised my opinion about whether men could be bi, and I told him repeatedly I believed he could have a happy life as either a straight or gay man. (I didn’t realize until I was writing this that even in trying to encourage him, I avoided the word bisexual.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The think-tank &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/invisible-majority.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="research I referenced earlier" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68070fe5e4b052543c13cab5" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.lgbtmap.org/file/invisible-majority.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;research I referenced earlier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; shows both gay and straight people have a bias against bisexual people, for whom “stigma, discrimination, and invisibility … create serious negative outcomes.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bias against bisexual men is so bad, only 12% tell those closest to them they are bi. Bisexual youth are more likely to be bullied, to smoke, to drink, to do drugs, to feel hopeless, to be homeless, to have eating disorders, and to be the victims of violence and sexual assault than either gay or straight youth. Bisexual adults are more likely to suffer from mood disorders and poor health, to have a substance-abuse disorder, to be rejected by their families, and to suffer from depression in their older years than either gay or straight adults. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sharing what Kyle kept as his deepest secret feels on the one hand like a betrayal of how he wanted to be perceived. But the more I’ve learned about the hardships faced by bisexual men, especially, the more I’ve come to believe Kyle’s shame around this facet of himself may have been a factor in his early death. My son may have been taught by our culture to feel ashamed of who he was, but in sharing his story, I am saying I will &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;be ashamed of this part of him anymore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’ll never know how much Kyle’s feelings about his sexuality contributed to his drug addiction, risk-seeking behaviors or early death by overdose. I wish I could have gotten him to talk to a therapist about his sexuality, and the potentially traumatizing encounters he had with grown men when he was a kid, but I don’t think he ever did. (He was an adult in therapy; I didn’t have much input.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can never undo the damage I did by telling him I didn’t believe bisexual men existed. But I hope other parents reading this will think twice about the messages even supposedly accepting families might be sending their children. I wish I could go back and tell my son instead that he could live a happy, healthy life as a bisexual man. I pray we can all work together to build a world where that is true. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

                &lt;p&gt;Eight additional measles cases were detected in the Central region, Emek Hefer, and Modi'in Illit, the Health Ministry announced Monday. According to the epidemiological investigation, four of the patients were infected abroad or through contact with individuals who had returned from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry recommends that the entire population ensure they are vaccinated: completing two doses starting from the age of one, spaced one month apart. Children up to the age of 6 should complete their vaccinations at maternal and child health clinics, children over the age of 7 should do so through school health services, and adults through their health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Individuals born before 1957 who were likely exposed to the virus during childhood do not need to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers tracked neuronal activity in mice and discovered ‘engram-to-be cells’ that synchronize during sleep, preparing to encode new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual role suggests that sleep quality between learning sessions affects both memory retention and the ability to acquire new knowledge. The findings could influence educational practices and treatments for cognitive and memory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Sleep Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep strengthens past memories while preparing neurons for new learning experiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engram-to-Be Cells:&lt;/strong&gt; Specialized neurons synchronize during post-learning sleep, setting the stage for future memory formation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanistic Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Synaptic depression and scaling during sleep are crucial for building readiness for future learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Toyama&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory formation, storage, and retrieval are fundamental processes that define who we are and how we interact with the world. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the cellular level, these processes rely on specialized neurons called engram cells—neuronal populations that physically encode our experiences and allow us to recall them later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109267"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a woman sleeping." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/sleep-memory-learning-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Their findings revealed that two parallel processes occur during post-learning sleep. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, scientists have made significant progress in identifying these neuronal ensembles and understanding some aspects of memory allocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although sleep is widely known to be essential for memory processing and consolidation, many of its underlying mechanisms and functions are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional views have largely focused on sleep as a backward-looking process that serves to strengthen past experiences, but could it simultaneously help prepare the brain for new learning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent effort to tackle this question, a research team from Japan, led by Distinguished Professor Kaoru Inokuchi from the University of Toyama, uncovered a dual role for sleep in memory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their paper, which will be published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; on April 28, 2025, explores how the brain simultaneously preserves past memories while preparing for future ones during sleep periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was co-authored by Specially Appointed Assistant Professor Khaled Ghandour, also from the University of Toyama; Dr. Tatsuya Haga from the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology; Dr. Noriaki Ohkawa from Dokkyo Medical University; and Professor Tomoki Fukai from OIST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers employed an advanced imaging system that combines live calcium imaging with engram cell labeling, allowing them to track neuronal activity in mice before, during, and after learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach gave them unprecedented insights into how specific populations of neurons behave across different cognitive states, including during sleep periods before and after learning events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed that two parallel processes occur during post-learning sleep. First, engram cells that encoded an initial learning experience showed reactivation patterns—confirming the well-established consolidation process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, they also identified a separate population of neurons, which they termed ‘engram-to-be cells,’ that became increasingly synchronized during post-learning sleep. These cells were later shown to encode a new, different learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Engram-to-be cells exhibited increased coactivity with existing engram cells during sleep, suggesting that this interaction helps shape new memory networks,” explains Prof. Inokuchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, the team developed a neural network model simulating hippocampal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model suggested that synaptic depression and scaling, which are mechanisms that adjust connection strengths between neurons during sleep, are essential for the emergence of engram-to-be cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these processes were disabled in the model, the preparation of neurons for future learning was significantly impaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed interesting dynamics between existing engram cells and engram-to-be cells, showing increased co-activation during post-learning sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hints at some form of information transfer or coordination between neural networks representing past and future memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have significant implications for our understanding of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They suggest that the quality of sleep between learning sessions may determine not only how well we remember what we’ve already learned, but also how effectively we can learn new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could influence approaches to education, cognitive enhancement, and the treatment of memory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the research opens new avenues for exploring how sleep disturbances might impact not just memory consolidation but also the brain’s preparedness for future learning challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that manipulating brain activity during sleep or sleep patterns may uncover methods to enhance memory by unlocking the brain’s latent potential,” says Prof. Inokuchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this study underscores the critical role of sleep in maintaining cognitive function and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want people to understand that sleep is not just about rest—it plays a crucial role in how the brain processes information,” Prof. Inokuchi concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With that in mind, we hope everyone will begin to value sleep more and use it as a way to improve their overall quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, memory, and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#770e1c1603183714031059025a03180e161a16591614591d07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yumiko Kato&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://u-toyama.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Toyama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Yumiko Kato – University of Toyama&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parallel processing of past and future memories through reactivation and synaptic plasticity mechanisms during sleep&lt;/a&gt;” by Kaoru Inokuchi et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallel processing of past and future memories through reactivation and synaptic plasticity mechanisms during sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, we experience new episodes and store new memories. Although memories are stored in corresponding engram cells, how different sets of engram cells are selected for current and next episodes, and how they create their memories, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that in male mice, hippocampal CA1 neurons show an organized synchronous activity in prelearning home cage sleep that correlates with the learning ensembles only in engram cells, termed preconfigured ensembles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after learning, a subset of nonengram cells develops population activity, which is constructed during postlearning offline periods, and then emerges to represent engram cells for new learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our model suggests a potential role of synaptic depression and scaling in the reorganization of the activity of nonengram cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our findings indicate that during offline periods there are two parallel processes occurring: conserving of past memories through reactivation, and preparation for upcoming ones through offline synaptic plasticity mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:36:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE80N3BmM0JXei04V19oQnhBcXRab3U3OTBGdGxqOTduckh5QzlzX0RZOVJPc3BhMng4Mkcyck5OUzR3a181SFo3N1Y2WEIwZUZKWVpLVDdMZXFoRnMyQmpXak9ZUE9IR0hL</guid></item><item><title>CT扫描会给您带来癌症吗？ -切口 | Will a CT Scan Give You Cancer? - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQSXFpY212Wi1fOGZueXhibjEwemFhTXBtZDBlTmZmQ0tGa0JUYUg2NmN6OGJ2YnlsQ19fYmYyOW1zYUUzZU03NTloSjJ0TVplZ0tLYjBVdTJMUWJkM3VZakZuU19Pd0Q2eEpDaGdZcmNtVFk4ZmtJVWF4RlhTYkFOSVFodkY5QVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content special-feature" data-editable="content"&gt;

Patients themselves may request CT scans too, if, say, they fear their bad cough could actually be lung cancer or want reassurance that a resected tumor hasn’t reemerged. But here’s the cruel irony: New research shows that these tests, all on their own, are projected to account for 5 percent of new cancers each year. To put that in context, &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/moms-smoke-vape-secret.html"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; leads to 19 percent of cancers, excess weight accounts for about 7 percent of cancers, and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general.html"&gt;alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; makes up 5 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wyd4lx00623b6ddi3h7ems@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;The study, published recently in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778?guestAccessKey=afde7c2e-df6b-4e7b-9ced-7a15ed74dc1d&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041425" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, looked at the estimated 93 million CT scans conducted on 62 million patients in 2023 and projected that the tests will cause nearly 103,000 future cancers. Children, and especially infants, were at highest risk, though adults made up the bulk of expected cancers — namely of the lung, colon, blood, bladder, and breast — since they get the most scans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77j002t3b6df0myscg8@published" data-word-count="90"&gt;While past research has shown a link between CT scans and cancer, the current paper’s findings landed on numbers three- to four-fold higher by accounting for, among other factors, multiphase scans, or those that capture images of your organs by sending ionizing radiation through your body more than once, lead study author &lt;a href="https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/smith-bindman.rebecca"&gt;Rebecca Smith-Bindman, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., told me. Plus, rates of CT scans themselves have gone up more than 30 percent since 2007. In the radiologist-researcher’s view, it was time to take a fresh look — and sound a louder alarm.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75j00273b6dttfmv42t@published" data-word-count="46"&gt;I talked to Smith-Bindman, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics and obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California San Francisco, about her team’s findings and whether there’s anything people can do — short of eschewing needed medical testing — to lower their risk of CT-scan-associated cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo79i003f3b6dqj089qh1@published" data-word-count="43"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do CT scans actually work, and what can they do that other imaging tests can’t? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Computer tomography, CT, is an essential and widely used tool in modern medicine. In some cases, it’s the most appropriate test for achieving rapid and accurate diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75l00283b6dxbzmqxdh@published" data-word-count="65"&gt;Both CT scans and, say, conventional radiographs use X-rays, but if you get a chest X-ray because you’re short of breath, for example, you’re taking an image from the front to the back. With CT scanning, you’re in a doughnut-like machine, and the X-rays are delivered around your entire body. By its very nature, it uses more radiation and leads to a lot more information.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75q002c3b6d9f2frmda@published" data-word-count="27"&gt;Just like all medical procedures, CT scans carry risk. Their most notable risk is exposure to ionizing radiation, which is known to increase the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75o00293b6ds0h8f6y9@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;Nonionizing radiation is used for things like MRI and ultrasound, but you know other sources of nonionizing radiation: your microwave, your cell phone, your cell-phone towers. Ionizing radiation, on the other hand, has enough energy to literally break DNA, so it causes genetic damage. Some of that damage will be repaired, and some of that damage will not be repaired and could lead to subsequent cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75q002a3b6dj7dy6q5f@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It wasn’t until I saw a picture of a CT scanner that I realized I might have had one for a brain-imaging test. When else are they commonly used? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shape of the CT scanner — looking like a big doughnut — is a lot like the shape of an MRI scanner, which doesn’t use ionizing radiation. So I’ve had many conversations with patients who aren’t sure which one of those tests they had. Even physicians are not always knowledgeable about which test has ionizing radiation and which one doesn’t. So you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo761002d3b6d344wjpgy@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;In the year we looked at, one in five people had gotten a CT scan. So many people get scans, and they get them for many, many reasons. You can use them for trauma situations, be it looking for intracranial bleeding or bleeding in the abdomen, or bone fractures that might be complex — it’s a great test for that. If a patient has a symptom that’s suspicious of cancer, CT scanning is often the first test you use to figure out if it is cancer. It’s also used to do surveillance of cancer to see if a particular treatment is working or not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo75q002b3b6dse9zpaer@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;It’s used across many chronic illnesses like autoimmune disease or diseases of the bowel like Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. It’s used to diagnose patients who have kidney stones, to look for vascular abnormalities like a blood clot in the lung, to evaluate patients for a suspected acute stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo765002e3b6da4gndz6s@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;In many scenarios where we use CT scanning, we can either not use a scan at all, or we can replace it with other tests that don’t use ionizing radiation like ultrasound or MRI. But for many indications, it’s absolutely the best test, and we should continue using it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo7c7003g3b6d8scksq7i@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are some people more likely than others to develop cancer from CT scans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The risk of one CT scan, in general, is not very high. The paper quantifies the risk based on age of exposure, type of scan (like head versus abdomen), and other factors. While we can’t say how much a single scan raises any individual’s risk, our figures do show that there’s about one cancer per 50 CTs in girls who get scanned before age 1, for example, and one cancer per 400 CTs in women ages 18 to 29.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76p002k3b6dem6rroup@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;But some patients have genetic syndromes that make them particularly at risk of developing cancer when exposed to radiation. Some of them you most certainly have heard of — Down syndrome and BRCA carriers — but there are lots of others, like Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo776002p3b6du38y9lyb@published" data-word-count="94"&gt;So a patient reached out to me. She has a new colon-cancer diagnosis and had an offer to participate in a trial testing a new medication that looks super promising. But part of the protocol requires her to have seven CT scans over a short period of time. She has Lynch syndrome, and she’s had many cancers because of this syndrome. So she’s between a rock and a hard place. In those cases, it’s hard for me to see the value of those scans, and I could definitely see the harm of those scans.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76c002h3b6dpoonqfn6@published" data-word-count="20"&gt;It’s really important to think about every scan. &lt;em&gt;Do I need this scan? How is it going to help me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76t002m3b6dcqsia32y@published" data-word-count="29"&gt;Patients need to have informed conversations with their health-care providers about the necessity of every scan and whether alternative imaging options like ultrasound or MRI might be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78p003a3b6dz2g9sopn@published" data-word-count="37"&gt;If CT is clearly indicated, the benefits likely far outweigh the risk. But it’s estimated that a third or more of all medical scans are not necessary. That’s a lot of scans that we could be avoiding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76u002n3b6df7wpm5ch@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s driving all of these unnecessary scans? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Physicians are incredibly strapped for time, and it’s easier sometimes to order a test than to sit down and spend as much time with the patient discussing the need for the test. It would also be disingenuous to not acknowledge that medical imaging is a very profitable part of the health-care system, and one of the drivers of scanning is that it brings in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76z002o3b6drdckc0ab@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;Sometimes the desire to get imaging comes from the patient, who feels that having the image is a reflection of really high-quality care. Even if the clinician has informed them that the likelihood of finding an actionable finding is extremely low, they still might want to get the CT scan because they want to be sure that their headache doesn’t reflect a brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77e002r3b6d2yw5rtk0@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;I know brain cancer — I lost a kid sister to brain cancer — I understand that anxiety very well. But if someone wants to get a scan just to reassure them that everything’s normal, they should understand that that scan comes with a small risk of cancer. So they’re looking for a needle in a haystack, and … they could be causing the cancer that they’re hoping to get reassurance about.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo76s002l3b6d1bwoi0uz@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the rise of sort of “advocacy TikTok” has anything to do with the surge in scanning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I fully support patients advocating for themselves, but they need to do so with information. I don’t think anyone’s advocating for themselves to have, let’s say, surgical exploration of their body to look for hidden cancer. That would be crazy. Obviously, surgery is fantastic in the right setting, but to just look around through surgery makes no sense. The same thing is true with medical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo7c8003h3b6dgsuxy34k@published" data-word-count="50"&gt;We have a website at UCSF called &lt;a href="https://knowyourdose.ucsf.edu/"&gt;Know Your Dose&lt;/a&gt;, and it shows patients how to advocate for themselves, how not to question the doctor’s authority, but to work with them to get both fewer tests as well as something we have not touched on yet: lower doses per test.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo7e4003i3b6dvd9hk6p3@published" data-word-count="55"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So some CT scans have lower doses of radiation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patients may assume that no matter where they go for a CT scan, they get the same dose. That’s not the case. Radiation doses are extremely variable — up to 20 times stronger at one facility than another — depending on where the patient goes for care.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77f002s3b6de3aaiwuq@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;UCSF was awarded a cooperative agreement with Medicare to develop a quality measure that judges the doses for CT scans to try to help incentivize physicians to lower them. That quality measure — it’s called &lt;a href="https://ecqi.healthit.gov/ecqm/eh/2025/cms1074v2?qt-tabs_measure=measure-information"&gt;excessive radiation dose&lt;/a&gt; — was rolled out, as an optional program, this year in hospitals and outpatient clinics across the country. For patients who really care about this topic, they should ask their doctors to send them to a place that has adopted this measure.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77m002w3b6dnfu82lfe@published" data-word-count="42"&gt;Patients should also ask their doctors, “Where should I go? Where are they going to ensure I receive the lowest dose?” And, when they get a scan, patients can further ask the technologist, “Can you do that scan with a lower dose?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77n002x3b6dcartq5bo@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does lowering the dose actually mean for the clinician? Are they seeing a less clear picture? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a really interesting question. If you’re talking about a radiograph and an X-ray in the chest that we mentioned earlier, there’s a very close relationship between the size of the dose you use and how the image looks. So if you use too much, you can’t see; the image gets unreadable.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77k002u3b6dp91mu2aq@published" data-word-count="13"&gt;If you use too little, it’s unreadable. So there’s a narrow sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78800323b6dy74xngos@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;For CT scanning, however, there’s a very, very wide sweet spot, all at the high-dose range. But your point is well taken — we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; push it down too low. The quality measure that I mentioned includes a balancing component to make sure that doses don’t go too low.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo77w002z3b6d9a7gmb40@published" data-word-count="66"&gt;The problem is not just selecting the dose — it’s the approach for setting the dose. The CT scanners look a little bit like a fighter-pilot console with all these buttons, and the manufacturers have not even standardized the approach to use to lower the dose. For one method, you raise the dial to get a lower dose, and for the other, you lower the dial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78000303b6d3j6rv6zf@published" data-word-count="48"&gt;Technologists are not empowered to do the best work they can because the manufacturers have created so much variation. If you go to a particular hospital, there may be 500 different ways to program that CT scan for a head scan, and there should be three or four.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo7ec003j3b6dn1yyuyhw@published" data-word-count="54"&gt;This work, to standardize CT use and dosing protocols, has to be done, and there are publications and people who have done it. Our team ran a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2763413?resultClick=1"&gt;randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; where we showed across 100 hospitals in the U.S., we could lower doses by 40 percent by giving feedback to hospitals on how they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78v003b3b6dqxv865wz@published" data-word-count="71"&gt;There are also many examples of physician groups that are leading the way to address CT overuse, offering models for improving patient safety and care. A pediatric oncologist at UCSF published a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18465805/"&gt;pivotal paper in 2008&lt;/a&gt; highlighting the risk of frequent surveillance CT scans in pediatric oncology patients. Many of these children were cured with chemotherapy, then faced an unnecessary increased risk of radiation-induced cancer due to repeated imaging. Totally tragic.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78100313b6d6yrrymbn@published" data-word-count="57"&gt;In response, the children’s oncology groups reevaluated their imaging protocols during and after treatment. They significantly reduced the number of scans that children had to undergo, and they favored using safer alternatives like MRI, ultrasound, and plain X-rays. That’s the kind of thoughtful, evidence-based reassessment that’s key to safer imaging that we need to see more of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78900333b6dd7yd3yh8@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With every new headline about a carcinogen, people say, “Everything causes cancer these days!” How do you respond? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s very hard. We’re bombarded with information about what does or doesn’t cause cancer. But seeing that the magnitude of this association is the same as the other risk factors — obesity, alcohol consumption — should help people see this is not a small thing. This is a big thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo79b003e3b6dbn0azfiu@published" data-word-count="49"&gt;The impact of the things that we do to try to reduce our risk of cancer like eating broccoli is pretty small. I’m not discouraging people from eating broccoli. I’m a big fan of eating broccoli. But we’re talking about really small things. Radiation is a really big thing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78o00393b6dh39ix20x@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you hear from people who regret past CT scans after coming across your work, and if so, what do you tell them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I spend a long time responding to those emails because the goal for me is not to frighten patients. I’ve gotten a CT scan. My children have gotten CT scans. I’ve both agreed to some CT scans and not agreed to others.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78g00373b6dg9iv9bq2@published" data-word-count="90"&gt;My youngest son, at one point, fell out of a tree, hit his head, and started falling asleep at the dinner table. We took him to the emergency room, and he got a CT scan. He didn’t have a bleed, and that was the right test to do. When we were leaving the emergency department, they said, “Let’s do one more CT to make sure it’s still nothing.” My husband said, “Can’t we just watch him and make sure he’s okay?” So we accepted one, and we didn’t accept one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo78a00343b6drj80ylfg@published" data-word-count="40"&gt;I don’t think twice about the scans that I’ve undergone or my children have undergone. They’re in the past. There’s nothing you can do about them — there’s no way you can counterbalance them with any potent serum or anything.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cm9wwo796003c3b6dyuaknma4@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;The risk of the scans tends to happen right away. So the more time that has passed since that scan, the risk of cancer goes down. But risk does depend on overall exposure, so limiting future exposure will lower your risk, and if you have one and avoid the second, that will give you a lower risk too.&lt;/p&gt;

These encompass dietary habits, physical activity levels, smoking status, and sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2021-part-2/adult-health-cholesterol" rel="nofollow"&gt;NHS England Digital&lt;/a&gt; reports that a concerning 59% of adults in England have elevated total cholesterol. High cholesterol typically doesn't present any noticeable symptoms, earning it the ominous moniker of a 'silent killer'. The only way to determine if you're affected is through a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-top-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol levels are detrimental as they can lead to plaque build-up in the arteries, resulting in a condition known as atherosclerosis. This can increase the risk of serious health complications like heart disease, stroke, and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes is another alarming health concern, as persistently high blood sugar levels can cause severe and potentially fatal complications affecting various organs and systems within the body. These complications can include heart disease, stroke, nerve damage, kidney disease, eye issues, and foot problems, reports &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/what-cardiovascular-dietitian-eats-prevents-31524101%22" rel="nofollow"&gt;Surrey Live&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-mce-linkchecker-status="valid"&gt;To combat high cholesterol and reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes, it's crucial to adopt a heart-healthy diet, engage in regular exercise, and make lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking and moderating alcohol consumption. This involves cutting back on saturated and trans fats, increasing your fibre intake, and incorporating healthy fats into your meals. Your doctor may also suggest medication like statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/welcome/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;UC Davis Health&lt;/a&gt;'s esteemed dietitian, Margie Junker, with a special focus on cardiovascular nutrition, has shared her top recommendations for avoiding heart disease. She dishes out seven food suggestions, alongside pointers on what to shun for optimal cardiac wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="jw-player-container"&gt;&lt;h3 class="jw-player-title"&gt;High cholesterol: Nutritionist reveals top prevention tips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Plenty of fruits and vegetables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junker champions the consumption of abundant fruits and vegetables. Her personal choices include: "My favourite is blueberries because they're a great snack, either fresh or frozen. I also love how easy spinach is to use. You can use fresh spinach as a salad or quickly sauté with garlic and onions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She identifies a fruit and veg-rich diet as crucial for lowering heart disease risk. Whether they are dried, fresh, frozen, or low in sodium if canned, all are beneficial. However, she cautions against certain items: "I avoid canned fruit in heavy syrup and any foods with high fructose corn syrup."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="wunderkind-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Whole grains rather than refined grains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For grains, whole options trump refined versions every time, according to Junker. She shares her preferred choices: "My favourite grains to eat are quick oats and quinoa. Both are whole grains and easy to cook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then warns against specific unhealthy alternatives: "I stay away from foods containing processed white flour because there are fewer nutrients and no fibre."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="whatsapp-group "&gt; &lt;strong class="wapp-head"&gt; Get seasonal recipes and cooking inspiration straight to your phone &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class="wapp-btn" href="https://www.express.co.uk/whatsapp-group-web/12?utm_source=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article_widget&amp;amp;utm_content=whatsapp-group-signup-in-article"&gt;Join us on WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wapp-inf"&gt;Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Healthy sources of protein&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plant protein:&lt;/strong&gt; "I love to eat a serving of nuts daily. Walnuts and almonds are known for their omega 3 fatty acids. A quarter cup of nuts makes a great snack. Eating more nuts was associated with lower risk of heart disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Lentils are high in fibre, high in protein, easy to cook, and may cause less gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort than beans. A higher intake of legumes (beans and peas) is linked to lower heart disease risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish and seafood:&lt;/strong&gt; "My favourites are salmon or seared ahi tuna because they are high in protein, have fewer calories and contain healthy heart Omega 3 fatty acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low-fat or fat-free dairy products:&lt;/strong&gt; "My favourite is non-fat Greek yoghurt because of its versatility. It's high in protein, has a lot of calcium, and can replace sour cream in many recipes. It's a great breakfast option, stirred with quick oats and berries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean cuts of meat and poultry:&lt;/strong&gt; "There is a direct association between eating red meat and the risk of heart disease and death. That relationship is even stronger for processed meat such as bacon or hot dogs. Instead of processed meats, I often choose skinless chicken thighs. It's leaner than most beef, affordable and has more flavour than chicken breast, which I get tired of. I avoid processed meats. What's in it? It's a mystery! I also steer clear of full-fat dairy products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.avif?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.webp?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.jpg?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.avif?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.webp?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.jpg?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.avif?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.webp?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.jpg?r=1745845154414" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.avif?r=1745845154414" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.webp?r=1745845154414" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Whole-wheat-pasta-6124335.jpg?r=1745845154414" alt="Whole wheat pasta" title="Whole wheat pasta" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;The dietitian avoids choosing and preparing foods high in salt &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Liquid plant oils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health guru steers clear of fats that remain solid at room temperature, such as bacon grease, shortening, and margarine. She also shuns tropical oils (coconut, palm, and palm kernel), animal fats (butter and lard), and partially hydrogenated fats. However, she occasionally utilises small quantities of coconut oil or butter to enhance the flavour of certain dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her preferred choice is avocado oil. "It has a high smoke point at 520 degrees", she noted. "I like to bake with walnut oil for added flavour. Liquid plant oils are rich in unsaturated fats, which reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and heart disease risk. These include oils from peanuts, most tree nuts, and flax seeds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Foods with limited salt and added sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margie Junker opts for dried herb blends, fresh herbs, and citrus to boost the natural flavours of foods. Explaining her minimal use of salt (sodium), she states: "There is a direct relationship between increased salt intake and high blood pressure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to healthily satisfying a sweet craving, the dietician shares: "I love using maple syrup in my coffee and oatmeal. I also sweeten with small amounts of local honey. I avoid any chemically based sweeteners and processed white sugar. Added sugars are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and being overweight. Alternative sweeteners have shown mixed effects on metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="photo changeSpace"&gt;&lt;p class="withoutCaption"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.avif?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.webp?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:10000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.avif?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.webp?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/674x400/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:100000px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.avif?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.webp?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/940x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" media="screen and (min-width:1200px)"&gt;&lt;source type="image/avif" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.avif?r=1745845154426" media="screen"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.webp?r=1745845154426" media="screen"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/590x/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" class="zoomEnabled" data-img="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426" alt="Woman cooking artichokes in frying pan" title="Woman cooking artichokes in frying pan" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="newsCaption"&gt;The health expert opts for whole grains rather than refined grains &lt;span class="caption"&gt;(Image: Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="magnifier" data-img="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/126/1200x712/secondary/Woman-cooking-artichokes-in-frying-pan-6124350.jpg?r=1745845154426"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Limited alcohol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dietician recommends: "Water with a splash of lemon or cucumber is a great option for added flavour. If you don't drink alcohol, don't start. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit your intake. The risk of atrial fibrillation (A-fib) and of stroke increases with increased alcohol intake. Stroke and coronary heart disease are lowest in those who drink 1-2 alcoholic beverages daily."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Staying active and eating right&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emphasising the importance of an active lifestyle combined with a nutritious diet, the secret to maintaining a healthy weight lies in balancing the two. Achieve the perfect energy balance by matching a healthful eating plan with a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dietician points out that sound nutrition isn't about extreme calorie cuts or embracing a diet high in saturated fats, as popularised by regimes like the Keto diet. Rather, it's about savouring fresh, whole, plant-based foods that are seasonal, providing crucial vitamins and minerals that support overall health and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这种韩国饮食有望在4周内减少脂肪，而不会损伤肌肉：将其添加到日常生活中的简单方法-印度时报 | This Korean diet promises fat loss in 4 weeks without muscle damage: Easy ways to add it to your daily ro - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle damage is one of the key side effects of weight loss that many of us are not aware of. When you lose weight too fast or don’t eat right, your body can start burning muscle instead of just fat. Muscle isn’t just about looking toned; it keeps your metabolism strong, helps you burn more calories, and keeps you feeling energetic. If you’re not getting enough protein or you’re doing extreme dieting, muscle loss can sneak up on you. You want to lose fat, not the good stuff your body needs! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Korean diet is going viral over social media for every right reason. The Switch-On diet, designed by Dr. Park Yong-Woo, is being adopted by many people because of its role in fat burning and not damaging the muscles. The diet pattern centres around intermittent fasting, protein rich meals with special emphasis on gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what exactly is the Korean Switch-On diet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, it’s about switching up the way you eat — not just cutting out calories, but focusing on the right types of food to fuel your body for fat loss while preserving muscle. It’s a diet that’s based on traditional Korean eating habits, which are naturally rich in whole foods, fermented items like kimchi, and lots of veggies and lean protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you ever experienced muscle loss during a weight loss journey?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of this diet are whole foods that promote fat loss, such as lean proteins (think chicken, fish, tofu), vegetables, and healthy carbs like sweet potatoes or brown rice. The diet encourages eating more fermented foods (a staple in Korean cuisine) like kimchi and miso, which are not only good for gut health but also for overall digestion. These foods help regulate your metabolism, reduce bloating, and prevent that sluggish feeling that often comes with restrictive diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this approach so effective is that it focuses on nutrient-dense foods that support your metabolism, help balance your hormones, and prevent muscle loss while burning fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Focus on protein intake and workout in the first week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first week focus on having protein drinks 4 times a day, take probiotics on an empty stomach in the morning and walk for 60 minutes a day. After 3 days you can reduce protein intake to 3 times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Focus on intermittent fasting in the second week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor recommends starting the second week with a cup of black coffee in the morning and cutting down protein drinks to only twice a day. "Do a 24-hour fast once a week. Instead of fasting for 24 hours starting at midnight, fast from an early dinner to an afternoon snack the next day, and then eat dinner normally," he recommends. "On fasting days, avoid high-intensity exercise, but exercise at a moderate level will be more effective. After fasting, eat a hearty, low-carb meal," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fast twice a week in the third week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor recommends fasting for 24 hours in the third week, but not on two consecutive days. "You should eat a high-protein meal after fasting to prevent muscle loss. After completing week 3, if your muscle mass has recovered to the level of the day you started the diet, proceed to week 4. If not, do it again," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fast thrice a week in the fourth week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last week of the diet, the doctor recommends eating low-carb meals for both lunch and dinner and drinking protein rich drinks for twice a day. "Fast for 24 hours three times a week, but do not do them consecutively," he recommends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add this diet to daily routine in easy steps:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kick off your mornings with a good source of protein. Try scrambled eggs, a smoothie with protein powder, or a bowl of Greek yogurt topped with fruit and nuts. This helps keep you full longer, gives you energy, and prevents muscle loss while you’re burning fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporate a serving of fermented foods into your lunch. Fermented foods are key to the Korean diet because they support digestion and gut health. A simple bowl of raita with your regular lunch will do wonders!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include healthy fats in your meals. A drizzle of olive oil on your salad, a handful of nuts, or some avocado on toast will help keep you satisfied between meals and support fat burning. Don’t skip the fats — they’re good for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein should be part of your snacks to help maintain muscle and keep cravings at bay. Grab a handful of nuts, a small piece of grilled chicken, or even a boiled egg to snack on between meals. This helps avoid overeating and keeps your energy stable throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final step is all about slowing down and enjoying your food. No more scarfing down meals on the go! Take the time to chew slowly, savor each bite, and listen to your body when it tells you it’s full. This helps with digestion and keeps you from overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Foods not to include in the switch-on diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When following a healthy eating plan or diet, it’s important to steer clear of several food categories. Avoid sugar-laden products like soft drinks, snacks, candies, and desserts, as well as milk with added sugars or soy milk. Flour-based foods like bread, cake, and pasta should also be limited. Alcohol, regardless of type, is best avoided entirely. Foods high in saturated fat (pork belly, ribs) and trans fats (cookies, fried foods) should be kept to a minimum. Caffeine is restricted at first, but black coffee is allowed after the second week. Avoid sweeteners like Zero Cola and salty foods like salted snacks and seasoning sauces for better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>医生说， “放屁”可能是健康老龄化的秘诀-英国赫芬顿邮报 | 'Fart Walks' May Be The Secret To Healthy Ageing, Doctor Says - HuffPost UK</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxOa29HNUtzaEktdzR1VGFMcEo3aEFuY0lXQUNiZEwxQ0FWMVhwd0I5X2tuNHUxaWhybTY1aTlNbGIwM2RJZDUybkgwd0h1SzNmXzdWaUE4NUNqNjZWZjdlUFFPOTVKc0l5SjBSWjlEbkRmME1PZEY5VjFHb2RyOHUwRGpGYjkwZDdrUFlFdUlQWTJpSDlXWkdF0gGeAUFVX3lxTE1Qeml6YllIclFDZnBjOXRtdmdiWFRIWW5ILXVWQXRXWDdyQzFhZVJoUWNieUJDOWdQRElxUzBCUVB2TURhbHY5anFlN0lLamNKM1cxbmp6Rk1jaEVtWjNCSGFfdjh0NUtVNEVtLUZLRVBVZFJjUHFjSS1ScURicDJrRjIweEpncHBkdUV0VVpEVno4SGtXRWc0Smh1NHdn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/walking/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="walking" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680f50e8e4b049bc73d58343" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/walking/" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;

It typically causes diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting that gets better naturally within a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, however, it can be life-threatening for vulnerable groups, including young children, the elderly and immunosuppressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study could not prove that the bug is directly responsible for rising rates of the disease, researchers said campylobacter jejuni may put the public at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as Italian scientists last week discovered that regularly eating chicken could double your risk of dying from 11 different types of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5f3b3790-21bc-11f0-9fa1-878caa005253" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, including colon and stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those that consumed over 300g of poultry — equivalent to about four portions — per week, had double the risk of dying from a digestive cancer, compared to those who are&lt;span&gt; less than one portion of poultry per week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Supermarkets must report data on the prevalence of campylobacter among their poultry products every three months so the FSA can monitor food quality. They share the proportion of their raw roasting chickens which have more than 1,000 colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) of campylobacter. At this level, chickens are considered highly contaminated and carry a risk of food poisoning. Retailers are supposed to ensure that no more than seven per cent of their chickens breach this levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colon cancer, long considered a disease of old age, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14631623/doctor-five-signs-colon-cancer-rise-Gen-Z-Millennials.html"&gt;increasingly striking people in their 20s, 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt; in a phenomenon that has baffled doctors around the world. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the new study, US researchers tracked over 70 patients with the disease and compared campylobacter jejuni levels in their digestive system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over a follow-up of three years they found a higher number of campylobacter jejuni in the 34 patients whose cancer had spread to other parts of the body, compared to the 37 which had not. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-host-microbe/fulltext/S1931-3128(24)00437-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1931312824004372%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell Host &amp;amp; Microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, they said the toxin cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), often found in campylobacter jejuni strains, may be behind the cancer's rapid acceleration because it causes DNA damage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Professor Christian Jobin, an expert in cancer microorganisms at the University of Florida and study co-author, added: 'These findings confirmed that CDT is essential for the bacteria's role in promoting cancer spread.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'When bacteria that produce CDT move to tumours outside the gut, it appears to accelerate the spread of these tumours.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tests on mice with human colon cancer tissue also found that CDT accelerated the spread of colon cancer tumours to other parts of the body, the researchers said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But further human studies are needed to confirm this direct link.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions. Some people also suffer with weight loss a s a result of these symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Latest UK data shows campylobacter laboratory confirmed cases have surged, with a 27 per cent rise logged between 2022 and 2024. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, supermarkets must report figures on the prevalence of campylobacter among their poultry products every three months so Food Standards Agency (FSA) officials can monitor food quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They share the proportion of their raw chickens which have more than 1,000 colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) of campylobacter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this level, chickens are considered contaminated and carry a higher risk of food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from the misery and pain of the illness itself, the FSA estimates the bacteria costs the economy some £900million a year in terms of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-eab22c20-240f-11f0-bcd2-1b1a3144889c" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; treatment and lost days at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid food poisoning, people should make sure they cook chicken thoroughly, separate meat from other foods, keep it in the fridge and wash their hands and utensils after touching raw meat, according to the FSA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chicken should also not be washed because it may splash bacteria elsewhere in the kitchen, it added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as Italian scientists last week suggested eating chicken multiple times a week could double your risk of dying from 11 different types of cancer including colon. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rates of a rare strain of the bug E.coli — known as non-0157 shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) — have risen almost 10-fold in England in just seven years &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, Italian scientists analysed diet and health information of nearly 5,000 people, mostly in their 50s, over almost two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggested chicken proteins exposed to high temperatures during cooking may form chemicals that can harm human cells, triggering changes that could develop into cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found those that consumed over 300g of poultry — equivalent to about four portions — per week, had double the risk of dying from a digestive cancer, compared to those who are&lt;span&gt; less than one portion of poultry per week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It could also be the result of feed given to poultry, or hormones or medications animals may be exposed to during the rearing process, the experts added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other recent research has also suggested food poisoning bug helicobacter pylori may too raise the risk of colon cancer by altering the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other bacteria, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and certain E. coli strains, have also been strongly linked to an increased risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerning research last week suggested E.coli may be to blame for a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14215241/doctors-reveal-tragic-young-people-colon-cancer.html"&gt;disturbing rise in colon cancer cases in under 50s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;US researchers analysed the DNA of 981 colon cancer tumours in patients aged either under 40 or over 70, across 11 countries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They found traces of colibactin, a cancer-linked toxin produced by certain strains of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/e-coli/index.html" id="mol-13f00d30-21e2-11f0-9fa1-878caa005253"&gt;E.

It’s still a once-a-week drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Bermuda’s health insurers vary, but Mr Lozier spelt out the Argus approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Ozempic is approved to treat type 2 diabetes, reduce heart risks in people with diabetes and heart disease, and, starting in 2025, help slow kidney disease in those with diabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Its active ingredient, semaglutide, is exactly the same as that contained in another drug, Wegovy — but only the latter, approved for weight loss, is covered by the insurer, which adheres to the book when it comes to deciding coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In that regard, Mr Lozier said that Ozempic, if prescribed for weight loss without a medical diagnoses, would not be covered under the company’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Bosch de Noya said she supported such vetting of payment by insurers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“People who have diabetes, generally there isn’t an issue with it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Some of the insurance companies may require more of pre-authorisation, particularly with Mounjaro, because it’s more expensive. And rightly so — there should be some level of pre-authorisation with both of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Regardless, Mr Lozier said, the island’s demand for the medications was increasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Monthly use of the drugs “surged by nearly 600 per cent between 2020 and 2023 for individuals under 25, and 300 per cent for those over 25”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mr Lozier said the monthly cost for Ozempic in Bermuda ranged from $936 to $1,300, “significantly higher than in regulated markets”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;The company estimated the annual cost per patient at about $10,00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mr Lozier said generic versions of the drugs stood to bring down costs “significantly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He added: “However, a generic version of Ozempic isn’t expected in the US until late 2031 or early 2032.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“In Canada, the semaglutide patent expires in January 2026, and several companies are expected to launch generics. Pending approval, these could lower the monthly costs by more than 50 per cent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Annabel Fountain, an endocrinologist with many years of experience with the medications, questioned Argus’s figures for cost, maintaining that she had seen substantially cheaper deals for the treatment described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Her advice to patients was: “Call around and see how much it costs elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Dr Fountain said use of the drugs was best undertaken with education on nutrition and a study of individual body composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said their results were “amazing” when properly deployed with attention to diet and fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Seventy-four per cent of us are overweight or obese,” Dr Fountain said. “The biggest health problem we have in Bermuda is diabetes and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Oncologists and cardiologists will agree. If we could prevent people from becoming obese or developing diabetes, we would have significantly less cancer or heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Dr Fountain said the weight loss triggered by the drugs could be a catalyst for the lifestyle changes required to eventually come off them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If your knees hurt when you’re 250 pounds, it’s hard to exercise,” she said. “But if you were to lose 50 pounds, it’s easier to exercise. It becomes a positive snowball effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Dr Fountain agreed that the emergence of cheaper, generic versions of the drugs held some promise for cutting costs, but said pricing on the island needed to be regulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If a wholesaler brings it in, and it only costs them $10, they can still charge people $100 for it — there’s no regulation at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said the development of a national drug formulary similar to Britain’s, now under way in Bermuda, would bring much needed precision to the prescription of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She added: “Potentially, there will be regulation in the future of the price of medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Bosch de Noya, whose focus is on diabetes, said she was optimistic that the medications could help to turn the tide on a host of chronic and debilitating diseases linked to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Are we winning the war on it yet?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“That still remains an outcome for us to watch and wait for, but that’s our hope — that with the improved outcomes, we will certainly see less of the devastating complications that we used to see with diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;

Now, he’s at a turning point. - Chicago Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9Vb2JsN1NxVVpOSUdzRTd0bGVBX1ZuOGluN1NjMVFxMTZ5MzVzZUkxNUFrWVo5Q0MzRENTNlQ1VWV2SjlocTVLalVyYkZGRUpZd245cGdSN2xTc0NxT3hqRmszVllTYmprUEo1RUVhMHY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly a year after he was diagnosed with colorectal cancer, WGN-TV reporter Mike Lowe’s cell phone pinged as he drove to work early last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a message from his doctor — the results of his latest colonoscopy, a test meant to show whether six weeks of radiation and four months of chemotherapy had worked. The results were exactly what he had hoped to see: The cancer was no longer detectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Getting those results, it was just the most amazing feeling,” Lowe said. “I think back to one year ago, when I went to the initial doctor’s appointment … .In some ways it feels like forever and in some ways it feels like the blink of an eye — but what a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a year that started with surprise at his diagnosis at the age of 44. Lowe’s surprise, however, quickly turned into a conviction that he would use his platform as a television news reporter to raise awareness about the disease, which has increasingly been striking people at younger ages. For the past year, he’s&lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/video/i%e2%80%99m-going-try-to-go-into-this-cancer-fight-as-strong-as-i-can-possibly-be-wgns-mike-lowe-shares-health-journey/10200561/"&gt; taken WGN viewers along on his journey&lt;/a&gt;, talking about his diagnosis in news segments, inviting cameras into his appointments and procedures and sharing  very personal details about his experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is a public health crisis in this country where younger and younger people are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 20% of colorectal cases were in people ages 54 or younger in 2019 — almost double the percentage as in 1995, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. Scientists aren’t sure exactly what’s causing the increase in diagnoses among younger patients, but they’re urging people to see their doctors if they experience unusual symptoms such as abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, diarrhea, bloody stools or constipation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth-most common type of cancer in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a journalist, Lowe felt it was his duty to share his experience with viewers.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“It’s my job to ask people about some of the worst experiences they have in their lives and be open and honest about it,” said Lowe, who’s won 39 Emmy Awards. “How I could do that for a living, and then when something like this happens to me, not be open and honest with the public about my own story?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe, who grew up in Evanston, knew he wanted to be a journalist from an early age. He attended Northwestern University before taking a series of broadcast jobs across the country. He earned a spot at WGN about a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe is a “born storyteller,” said Dominick Stasi, news director at WGN-TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s probably the best storyteller that I’ve ever worked with, and when it came time for this journey that he was going on … he saw this as a way for him to tell his story and also educate people,” Stasi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The diagnosis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lowe was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago, he now realizes that the disease had been building for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About five years ago, Lowe began experiencing concerning symptoms, such as blood in his bowel movements. He knew he had a family history of the illness, because his grandfather had colon cancer. Lowe went to his general practitioner at the time, who recommended a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I fumbled the ball,” said Lowe, a huge Chicago sports fan. “She gave me the referral and I just never made the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

(Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s indicative of especially a lot of young men who are apprehensive about a colonoscopy,” Lowe said, adding that, “I guess you’re also worried about what they might find.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years later, he had a new doctor. He told the new doctor he was ready to get the colonoscopy and asked for another referral. That doctor, however, told him he’d get a colonoscopy when he was 45, Lowe said. The &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening"&gt;U.S. Preventative Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; lowered the age at which it recommends most patients be regularly screened for colorectal cancer from 50 to 45 in 2021, partly in response to more younger people developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe moved on. He was still having some constipation and a little abdominal pain, but he was an otherwise healthy guy in his early 40s. He did triathlons and was known among friends and colleagues for his energy, humor and positivity. He jokes now that he thought, at the time, that maybe he just needed to lay off the Mexican fast food and eat more kale salads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by February of last year, he could no longer ignore his escalating symptoms. He had blood in every bowel movement and felt like he couldn’t empty his bowels all the way. One night he ended up in an emergency room with stabbing abdominal pain. He waited for a few hours but started feeling better and left without being seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he told his mom about the episode, she was alarmed and insisted he make an appointment with his doctor — in front of her. She watched as he sent a message over his phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe got an appointment, and the doctor did a rectal exam. Almost immediately, he was fairly sure that Lowe had cancer. A colonoscopy soon confirmed the doctor’s suspicion. Lowe had stage 3 colorectal cancer. The cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes, but not yet to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ll always have in the back of my mind, ‘Man, I wonder if I had had a colonoscopy back then if we would have caught this as a polyp instead of stage 3 cancer,’” Lowe said of his earlier visits to doctors. “What I later learned is you really have to advocate for yourself if you think there’s something wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sharing his battle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, Lowe faced a winding path of medical appointments, treatments and side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he started with radiation. He had about 30 rounds of radiation treatments over six weeks. The worst side effects, he said, were fatigue toward the end and a burning sensation during urination. “Radiation is a lot easier on the body today than it was 20 or 30 years ago,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also making radiation a little easier was the patient in line before him each day: famed former Cubs player Ryne Sandberg, who has been battling prostate cancer. As a child, Lowe had a poster of Sandberg on his bedroom wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two ended up spending a lot of time together, talking about everything from radiation side effects to the Rolling Stones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was unbelievable to me because he was one of my childhood heroes,” Lowe said. “To see one of your heroes like that, in that context, it was surreal.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe would get radiation treatments early in the morning and then head to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were certain setbacks, but he just tackled each and every one of them and wanted to keep working as much as he could,” said Stasi  of WGN. “He approached the whole thing with a positive attitude. It was really kind of inspiring.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe also continued working through his chemotherapy, which took a heavier toll on him than radiation. The side effects of chemotherapy intensified as the weeks went on. He experienced nausea, numbness in his hands and feet, and the skin on his feet and palms peeled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, he developed sores in his mouth and throat, as part of a condition called mucositis, which he described as akin to the worst case of strep throat he’s ever had — times two. He detailed his ordeal with mucositis, which happened while he was on a pre-planned vacation from work, &lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/news/medical-watch/there-have-been-some-really-hard-stretches-mike-lowe-reflects-on-his-cancer-fight/"&gt;in a segment on WGN&lt;/a&gt;, describing how he couldn’t swallow or sleep for six days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in general, the side effects never got so bad that he needed to take a medical leave from work. Rather, he went to work most days, sometimes wearing a small zippered pouch across his chest that contained chemotherapy medication, which traveled via a tube from the bag to a port in his chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted cancer to be something important that was going on in the background of my life but not completely dominating it,” Lowe said. “If I could have a real purpose and go to work and feel like I was able to do it and do it well still, then I was going to do it no matter what.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe believes that he may have been able to keep working through cancer treatments partly because he was relatively young and healthy going into them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August he did live shots each night from the United Center. He worked election night in November and then allowed &lt;a href="https://wgntv.com/video/there-have-been-some-really-hard-stretches-mike-lowe-reflects-on-his-cancer-fights/10255870/"&gt;WGN’s cameras to follow him&lt;/a&gt; to Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital for chemotherapy the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to kind of demystify cancer treatment or show exactly what it looks like,” Lowe said. “If you can help anybody understand what they’re about to go through, I think that helps, and the position of a journalist is to do that, to explain things and make them more understandable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Daniel Dammrich, one of Lowe’s doctors and an oncologist at Northwestern’s Lake Forest hospital, said he’s already seen people benefiting from Lowe’s news segments, getting screened for cancer earlier than they might have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, before Lowe and Dammrich were patient and doctor, they were teenage football teammates at Loyola Academy in Wilmette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s just always been a great guy,” Dammrich said. “Mike has been extraordinarily brave to share his story, and there’s no doubt in my mind that it’s going to benefit a huge amount of people who are going to go for early colorectal cancer screenings so they can catch it in a time where we can intervene in a meaningful way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;‘Keep up the fight!’&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his treatment, Lowe received support from many unexpected quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after hearing about Lowe’s diagnosis, Joe Johnson, founder of &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/06/24/meet-joe-johnson-the-chicago-cubs-fan-behind-obvious-shirts-a-t-shirt-company-built-on-one-liners-a-love-of-baseball-and-a-little-luck-it-worked-i-cant-believe-it/"&gt;Obvious Shirts&lt;/a&gt;, released a T-shirt that said “Lowe Strong” with a similar design to the Bears sweaters coach Mike Ditka used to wear. Lowe had done stories on Johnson and Obvious Shirts in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you know Mike, you know he’s a huge Bears fan, a diehard Bears fan, so I thought it was only right we show our support,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, Gov. JB Pritzker sent Lowe a handwritten note expressing support and encouraging him to, “Keep up the fight!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have really felt the outpouring of support from really the entire city,” Lowe said. “I think that’s kind of a hallmark of Chicago. … You see how much you’re loved and you see how much people care and want to help. That is almost as important as the medical part, in terms of making you well again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in January, after chemotherapy, Lowe underwent an MRI and had a sigmoidoscopy, a procedure that involves using a camera to look at the lower part of the colon. If the tumor was still there, the next step would be surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe got tentatively good news. The doctor couldn’t see the tumor anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

(Stacey Wescott/Chicago Tribune)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe was optimistic about his prospects, but he would need a colonoscopy and biopsies months later to see if the cancer had really retreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That colonoscopy happened earlier this month. Biopsies were performed on polyps found during the procedure, and they came back clear of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of like singing Hallelujah from the church balcony,” Lowe said of learning the results. “It definitely felt amazing because up until that point I didn’t know …I feel like it’s the complete response I’d been hoping against hope for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Lowe is characteristically optimistic, he knows he won’t be leaving cancer totally behind him just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’ll continue to undergo regular tests to ensure the cancer hasn’t returned. He’s also still dealing with lingering side effects, such as the numbness in his hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe also has no plans to step back from the public stage when it comes to discussing his experience. He has a calendar full of events in coming months where he’ll give speeches and emcee events to raise awareness and money for various cancer-related efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel like I owe it to anyone who’s dealing with cancer, if I can be the voice, whether it’s for fundraising, awareness or even if it’s just to comfort them, to show them, ‘Hey you can get through this,’ because at the time you get the diagnosis, it doesn’t always seem like that. It seems like a pretty steep hill to climb,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I can continue to be that example to anyone, I want to continue to do that because I know how lucky I am to be through it.”&lt;/p&gt;

She shared that maintaining optimal brain, heart and bone function as well as immune health and disease prevention are all linked to having a nutrient-rich diet in place. “What we eat today shapes how we function tomorrow,” Mahajan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In terms of how to eat in a way that supports your healthspan, there are no gimmicks or surprises; it’s the tried-and-true dietary advice that has long been backed by scientific research. “Focus on whole foods: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes and lean protein.

The body absorbs it better and it’s definitely tastier,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you approach the years you will qualify for an AARP membership, it’s important to up your protein intake. “Muscle mass naturally declines with age, so regular protein intake is key,” Mahajan said. She added that increasing fruit and vegetable intake is also important as we age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5293796/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="One meta-analysis of nine studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a76eee4b0d1cc4a5a9665" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5293796/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One meta-analysis of nine studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that older adults with high fruit and vegetable intake had a significantly lower risk of cognitive decline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Good nutrition helps our brain and cognition, lowering the risk of memory problems. It helps with bone and muscle strength, which lowers the risk of falling, and it also lowers the risk of diabetes and hypertension,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/Laurie-Archbald-Pannone-1356544233" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Laurie Archbald-Pannone" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a76eee4b0d1cc4a5a9665" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/Laurie-Archbald-Pannone-1356544233" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Laurie Archbald-Pannone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;a geriatrician and associate professor of medicine at UCLA. “It’s important to think about how we can have an impact. Healthy aging isn’t all about diet, but it is something we can [control]. Regular movement and maintaining healthy relationships are other important parts of healthy aging we can control,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what geriatricians avoid consuming to support healthy aging.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Certainly, one meal isn’t going to destine you to years of failing health. Especially considering Archbald-Pannone’s point about the importance of healthy relationships, it’s important to remember that meals are about more than just getting nutrients; they’re also about enjoyment and a way to spend time with loved ones. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Maria Korneeva via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Maria Korneeva via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;If you're wondering whether diet soda is an option, think again.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, there is something all of the geriatricians we talked to said they avoid because of how detrimental it is to health: sugar-sweetened beverages.

For flavoring, consider adding fruit (like lemon or sliced strawberries) or herbs (like mint).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While one soda every once in a while isn’t going to make or break your golden years, if you drink soda every day, it’s a habit worth reconsidering. After all, it’s the foods and drinks we consume regularly that impact health the most. If soda is a habit you just can’t quit, Archbald-Pannone said it can be helpful to reduce your soda intake gradually instead of trying to give it up completely right off the bat. Slowly and over time, you’ll find you won’t miss it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 11:00:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPd1dWak80cWU1SGJpWllmTUJoQWFOZExIY09jYVdXYjREd0NwRVdMaU10RGFxaW5WLVZNUjFRQ2lLSHczMUhZZ2dqSUppaDRXUU82YWlTdHdCekd4WjNsTER1Z3NZRlB2cWExS1F1cEwwOXRIOVFaTm9xS3EwVTBiWXFwa1R1cGpWeFNMTkhLcmtjaWZMUHU1R9IBngFBVV95cUxNUEM5bElUM2E4VFkxWmYyUDVtLTJDS2RheF92XzNoV2EyVGxMU3VCRzVRZjBjMnpUbzRKMEcybmEyVVZzdE5mU0FVazZheFpZNlhlOVlqUnZmUWlxbjhKZFVwOGdYV1FtaDBmMlIxRmJoSHJxX2JGc0JuQUxIYVlrb0tBR0JXcTdibDA2eUdLcFdPTl9DYWFwaTVhV3dXQQ</guid></item><item><title>来自全国各地的人都想来CT进行健康手术。这是为了什么。- Hartford Courant | People from across the country want to come to CT for a health procedure.

A stroke in 2013 had immobilized much the left side of his body. He’d lost the job he loved running a marina and the housing that came with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nute’s life changed significantly over the last 12 months following the implant of a technology known as &lt;a href="https://www.vivistim.com/"&gt;Vivistim&lt;/a&gt; that’s gaining attention in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State lawmakers are looking to establish a program at the University of Connecticut, where 10 veterans will be able to undergo the procedure for free and physicians will conduct further research to improve the &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/2024/11/26/a-stroke-changed-a-teachers-life-how-a-new-electrical-device-is-helping-her-move/"&gt;effectiveness of the treatment. &lt;/a&gt;The $55.7 billion two-year budget adopted by the legislature’s Appropriations Committee last Tuesday includes $2 million in fiscal year 2027 to establish a Center of Excellence for Neuromodulation Treatment at UConn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vivistim device, implanted in a patient’s neck and chest, includes a battery and a narrow cable that wraps around the vagus nerve. When turned on, the device sends electrical signals to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-iLgdKCFX" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_iLgdKCFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation, as it’s known, refers to the process of altering how the brain receives information from the body by stimulating nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reasons physicians still don’t entirely understand, employing &lt;a href="https://www.neuromodulation.com/about-neuromodulation"&gt;neuromodulation&lt;/a&gt; by stimulating the vagus nerve through electric signals appears to rapidly increase the rate at which the brain learns new tasks. When paired with physical therapy, the device can help stroke survivors regain lost functionality — even if, like Nute, their stroke occurred several years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It supercharges therapy,” Christopher Conner, the &lt;a href="https://health.uconn.edu/"&gt;UConn&lt;/a&gt; neurosurgeon who performed the procedure on Nute. “You basically get into a state where your brain is able to learn or adapt more quickly,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conner was among a group of physicians on the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.housedems.ct.gov/genga/veterans-disabilities-task-force-meeting"&gt;Veterans with Disabilities Task Force&lt;/a&gt; who sought funding from the legislature to cover the procedure at UConn and subsequent rehabilitation at &lt;a href="https://hartfordhealthcare.org/"&gt;Hartford HealthCare&lt;/a&gt; for 10 veterans. The funding would offer much-needed health care to an underserved group, as well as provide physicians and researchers with more data about how exactly the procedure improves results for stroke patients, according to supporters.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;h4&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who suffer strokes often hit a recovery plateau beyond which it’s difficult for them to continue making progress towards regaining mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation offers results far beyond what’s been available in stroke recovery up to this point, according to several providers in the state. Connecticut physicians said they’ve seen patients regain basic functionality and return to hobbies — like cooking, playing guitar, and golfing — that they had to give up after their stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nute was still struggling with physical side effects when he saw an advertisement on Facebook promoting a new technology that could boost hand and arm function after a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just got tired of having my mobility impaired and wanted to improve it,” Nute said. Eager for results and open to new solutions, Nute reached out to the company and then an occupational therapist to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they met roughly a month later, in January 2024, Conner told Nute that he wanted to be transparent: He had never done the procedure before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘Well, I haven’t either, so that’s two of us,’” Nute recalled with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nute underwent the procedure in May of 2024, and since then he said his range of motion has increased significantly. He loves to cook, so he’s most excited about the accomplishments that translate to the kitchen. Nute still attends group rehabilitation regularly, both in-person and on Zoom, and he also receives Botox injections every three months that help to relax the muscles in his arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When I first got the thing done, I wasn’t noticing improvements right away,” Nute said. But over time, he said, that changed. “When I look at videos of myself before and after, I can see significant differences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conner has now done a total of 12 implants, with another five booked in the next few months. He said he gets calls weekly from patients all over the country who want to come to Connecticut for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The interest in this is unbelievable,” Conner said during public testimony at the state legislature. “Here at the &lt;a href="https://uconn.edu/"&gt;University of Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve established ourselves as a nation-leading center for this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagus nerve stimulation isn’t entirely new, Conner said. It’s been used in the past to treat seizures and depression, with limited results. But using the treatment for stroke recovery is novel — the Food and Drug Administration approved Vivistim to treat upper extremity impairments post-stroke in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real “magic,” as Conner puts it, happens in therapy, which patients begin two weeks after getting the implant. For six weeks, patients attend rehabilitation three times a week, for 90 minutes per session. The sessions focus on completing upper extremity exercises, like reach and grasp, object flipping and needle threading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each task is repeated about 50 times, and patients might perform a total of 300 repetitions in a single session, Subramani Seetharama, a rehabilitation specialist at Hartford HealthCare, said. As the patient performs these exercises, the physician turns on the Vivistim system, which sends those electric signals to the patient’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seetharama, who’s been practicing medicine for 30 years, said he’s been frustrated that treatments available to stroke patients up until now have only offered temporary improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s been kind of disappointing,” Seetharama said. “But here I see an amazing, lasting, persistent improvement in strength and function.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolyn Brown, cofounder of &lt;a href="https://www.strokeot.org/"&gt;StrokeOT Inc.&lt;/a&gt; and an occupational therapist who has treated Nute and other Vivistim patients, stated in written public hearing testimony that she has “witnessed truly miraculous results.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vivistim has given chronic stroke survivors renewed hope and optimism for their continued recovery journey,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;State funding&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicians still have lots of questions about how the mechanics of neuromodulation helps facilitate better results for stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed state funding would go towards studying brain activity in patients at different points in their treatment. It would also fund research on the effects of the treatment on patients’ ability to walk. Vivistim is currently only FDA-approved for upper extremity recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the dirty secrets of many things in modern medicine is we have a poor understanding of how it works,” Conner said. “The problem with that is that it makes it very difficult to make to optimize that therapy. So what we want to do is we want to figure out what parts of the brain are actually leading to this improved learning ability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Foust, CEO of Vivistim distributor &lt;a href="https://www.microtransponder.com/"&gt;MicroTransponder Inc.,&lt;/a&gt; said in emailed comments that “the company applauds UConn Health, Hartford HealthCare and all the champions of this bill for bringing it closer to fruition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MicroTransponder is incredibly honored that this legislation will make Vivistim available to our Veterans to improve their hand and arm function post-stroke,” wrote Foust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the public hearing for the proposal, Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien, asked whether there are other potential funding sources for this treatment and research outside of the state government. Conner said that in the current environment, much of grant funding is on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Granting agencies and the program officers are telling people that nothing is getting reviewed,” Conner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nute said the idea of more people getting access to Vivistim is “wonderful” and that funding for research is “needed.” More than a decade after his stroke, he remains deeply involved in the survivor community. He serves on the board of a stroke survivors support group and regularly speaks about his experience with neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I talk to people virtually everyday who’ve either had a stroke or they know somebody that’s had a stroke and try to get them thinking that this is not the end of the road,” Nute said. “There is hope. Don’t give up.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As humans age, particularly after middle age, their brain functions, cognitive abilities and memory can deteriorate to varying degrees. Aging-related disorders marked by cognitive decline, particularly dementia, have become increasingly widespread over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Estimates suggest that the number of individuals diagnosed with dementia could increase from 55 million in 2019 to around 139 million by 2050. Understanding the factors contributing to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; and devising methods to detect the first signs of dementia is thus of the utmost importance, as it could help to reliably pick up its emergence and plan therapeutic interventions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some studies have found a link between people's ability to perceive and identify odors (i.e., olfactory function) and their cognitive abilities as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;. While the relationship between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/olfactory+dysfunction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;olfactory dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive decline is now well-documented, whether one causes the other or they are the result of similar aging-related or neurodegenerative mechanisms remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Fudan University in China recently carried out a study to further explore the link between olfactory dysfunction and cognitive decline in older adults. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-025-03346-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Translational Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that the nasal &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/microbiome/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;microbiome&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., the set of microorganisms residing in each individual's nasal passages) could contribute to the relationship between olfactory function and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Emerging evidence has highlighted that olfactory dysfunction, a common feature of aging, is increasingly linked to cognitive decline in older adults," wrote Huiling Song, Jiaojiao Zou and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, research on the underlying mechanism, particularly the role of nasal microbiome, remains limited. In this study, we investigated the associations between olfactory function, the nasal microbiome, and cognition among 510 older adults with an average age of 77.9 years."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of their study, the researchers recruited 510 older adults and looked at their olfactory function, nasal microbiomes and cognitive abilities. Their olfactory function was assessed using a procedure known as the brief Chinese smell identification test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+abilities/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive abilities&lt;/a&gt; of the study participants, the researchers asked them to complete tests based on two psychometric measures, known as the mini-mental state examination and a revised Hasegawa dementia scale. Finally, they generated microbiome profiles for each participant using a method known as 16S RNA gene sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We observed that olfactory dysfunction (i.e., hyposmia) was associated with a higher richness of nasal bacteria, and such observation was replicated in an external dataset," wrote Song, Zou and their colleagues. "A total of 18 nasal bacterial genera were identified to be associated with olfactory function, with eight genera such as Acidovorax and Morganella being enriched in the hyposmic group."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;When they analyzed the data they collected, the researchers unveiled correlations between some microbial profiles and different levels of cognitive impairments. In fact, they found that people with microbiome profiles marked by a prevalence of some genus of bacteria were found to have milder cognitive impairments than those that predominantly contained other genus of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A composite microbial index of nasal olfactory function significantly improved the reclassification accuracy of the traditional risk model in distinguishing hyposmic from normosmic participants (P = 0.008)," wrote Song, Zou and their colleagues. "Furthermore, participants with a nasal biotype dominated by Corynebacterium had a lower prevalence of mild cognitive impairment compared to those dominated by Dolosigranulum or Moraxella."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results suggest that the types of bacteria populating the noses of individuals could contribute to the previously reported link between older people's &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/olfactory+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;olfactory function&lt;/a&gt; and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, their study could pave the way for further research focusing on the nasal microbiome profiles they identified, which may help to devise new strategies to detect cognitive decline early and plan targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/signs-symptoms-screenings-treatments-bowel-cancer/"&gt;Bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; is on the rise in young people – even in those with no family history of the disease or obvious risk factors, like being overweight, smoking or drinking too much alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases among the under-50s have shot up by 22 per cent over the last few decades too. Now every year, more than 2,600 people in this age group are told they have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/signs-symptoms-screenings-treatments-bowel-cancer/"&gt;bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason behind the surge remains unknown. Our sedentary lifestyles, the rise in obesity, heavy drinking and low-fibre, high-fat diets are some of the reasons that scientists have put forward as contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that exposure to a toxin in childhood – called colibactin and produced by certain strains of E. coli – could, at least in part, be fuelling the surge. Here’s what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What are the strains of E. coli that are causing concern?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/e-coli-outbreak-uk-symptoms-how-does-it-spread/"&gt;Escherichia coli (E. coli)&lt;/a&gt; bacteria is commonly found in our guts. Most strains are harmless and some, such as Nissle 1917 (EcN) are even beneficial and aid in digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, others, such as pks+ E. coli, release toxins that may cause bowel cancer. Scientists don’t yet know how these “bad bug” make there way into our gut or how we can avoid them. Additionally, they may not be harmful in all cases and some strains that produce toxins are even used in probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of a research study, it’s not currently possible to tell whether the bacteria in your gut are producing harmful toxins that could raise your bowel cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is colibactin, the worrying toxin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain strains of E. coli produce a bacterial toxin called colibactin. This is thought to be a defence mechanism to protect itself from other bacteria, explains Dr Paul Brennan, who runs the genetics section at the International Agency for Research on Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colibactin can damage the DNA in our bowel cells by introducing mutations, adds Justin Stebbing, an oncologist and professor of biomedical sciences at Anglia Ruskin University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How could colibactin be fuelling the rise in bowel cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DNA damage caused by colibactin leaves a trail of mutations that scientists have previously found in 10 to 15 per cent of all bowel &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/least-survivable-cancers/"&gt;cancer cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the new study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, strengthens this link, suggesting that exposure to colibactin in early childhood by the age of 10 sets the stage for cancer, long before symptoms arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists led by the University of California San Diego analysed nearly 1,000 bowel cancer genomes and found that mutations caused by colibactin were 3.3 times more common in patients who developed bowel cancer before they turned 40, compared to those who developed the disease after the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests a strong link between colibactin exposure and early onset bowel cancer,” says Dr Vivian Li, the group leader of the Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The latest research on this shows a clear correlation, especially in younger people, between colibactin and the production of mutations that potentially caused bowel cancers to grow,” adds Prof Trevor Graham, the director of the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at The Institute of Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is more work to do to really prove that colibactin is responsible for the increase that we’re seeing in early onset bowel cancer, but we should be looking very hard at the link with colibactin producing bugs going forward,” Prof Graham adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it may be that colibactin is just one part of the jigsaw puzzle of risks fuelling the rise in bowel cancer among young people, Prof Stebbing notes. “I’d describe it as a potential culprit. We just can’t say it’s causative,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How can I avoid being exposed to colibactin?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists don’t yet know how children are being exposed to colibactin-producing bacteria, so it isn’t yet clear what actions will reduce the risk of it &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/the-little-known-cancer-thats-linked-to-the-gut/"&gt;taking hold in your gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are working to try to understand exactly when these mutations occur,” says Dr Brennan, who is also co-investigator for Cancer Research UK’s Cancer Grand Challenges, which funded the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they occur within the first weeks of life then this would implicate exposures around childbirth and weaning. This is when the infant microbiome is formed. Conversely, if they occur later in infancy, this could implicate dietary sources.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just don’t know yet what might disrupt the natural bacteria in the gut early in life to lead to growth of these strains of bacteria that produce colibactin,” Prof Stebbing adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dr Li notes that contaminated food and untreated water can contain these bacteria, so improving food safety and hygiene may help minimise exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And some colibactin-producing bacteria are used in probiotics, she notes. “More research would be needed to address the safety [of this],” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the latest study are now investigating potential sources – such as diet, the environment and lifestyle behaviours – and what can be done to prevent or mitigate that contact with these bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also not currently possible to find out whether you have worrying mutations caused by the bacterial toxin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is very much laboratory based research just now, and there’s no routine test for it,” Prof Stebbing explains. However, the researchers are currently developing an early detection test to analyse stool samples for colibactin-related mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, even if these tests become available, it is unclear what can be done to reduce the risk of bowel cancer occurring. “We don’t have a treatment available, or know if removal of the bugs would be beneficial to prevent bowel cancer, or even if there could be other unintended consequences,” notes Prof Graham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What can I do to protect against bowel cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are exploring whether &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/probiotics-gut-health/"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; could safely eliminate harmful bacterial strains from the gut, which produce colibactin. In the meantime, there are plenty of other actions that can dramatically lower your bowel cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding more fibre to your diet – such as by eating plenty of fruit, vegetables, legumes and wholegrains – can drive down the chance of developing the disease because it helps to keep bowel movements regular, meaning harmful chemicals in stools spend less time in the bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, fibre interacts with bacteria in the gut to make butyrate, which helps keep the cells in the bowel healthy, reducing the risk of tumours developing. More than a quarter (28 per cent) of bowel cancer cases are caused by not consuming enough fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting red and processed meat intake can help to reduce your risk of bowel cancer. Around 13 per cent of bowel cancer cases in the UK are linked to having too much of it in our diet because the foods contain substances such as nitrates and nitrites, which damage the cells in the bowel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is another cause of bowel cancer (estimated to be behind 11 per cent of cases) so losing weight by eating a balanced diet and exercising more can help to reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being physically active and cutting back on alcohol are also changes you can make to reduce bowel cancer risk,” says Sophia Lowes, a senior health information manager at Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter how old you are, if you notice anything that isn’t normal for you, don’t ignore it, speak to your doctor. In most cases it won’t be cancer, but if it is, spotting it early can make a real difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of bowel cancer include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/what-the-colour-and-consistency-of-your-poo-says-health/"&gt;changes in stools&lt;/a&gt; – such as having softer stools, diarrhoea or constipation that is not normal for you – needing to go to the toilet more often and blood in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whatever your age, it’s important that you contact your GP and ask for an at-home test if you spot any symptoms,” says Dr Lisa Wilde, director of research, policy and influencing at Bowel Cancer UK. “Bowel cancer is treatable and curable especially if diagnosed early.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Phase 3 study of the M72/AS01E vaccine, which is taking place at 54 sites across five countries, started delivering shots to volunteers last March. While its sponsors had originally said it may take up to two years to complete enrollment, they announced Monday that the sites in South Africa, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, and Indonesia have successfully recruited the 20,000 participants needed for the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People have generally been really enthusiastic about participating,” said Lee Fairlie, a researcher at Johannesburg’s University of the Witwatersrand and one of the principal investigators for the South Africa trial sites. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two-dose M72 vaccine has generated high hopes among experts that they could in the coming years have a new tool to reduce deaths from and cut transmission of one of the world’s leading killers. But its clinical trial is advancing at a time when the TB field is grappling with dramatic U.S. global health funding cuts, which are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/health/tuberculosis-kenya-us-cuts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;already threatening treatment and surveillance programs&lt;/a&gt;. The U.S. has also moved &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;to pull support for Gavi&lt;/a&gt;, which helps low-income countries — including those with the highest TB burdens — purchase vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know yet what the full impacts are of the cuts, but almost certainly it will have a huge impact on TB screening, diagnosis, and probably treatment,” Fairlie said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine trial is being funded by the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, and has not been affected by the U.S. withdrawal from the global health stage. The Gates Medical Research Institute, which is a subsidiary of the foundation, is leading the development of the vaccine, which includes an adjuvant — an ingredient that can supercharge the immune response a vaccine elicits — provided by GSK.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis, which is a bacterial infection, still kills more than a million people a year. It’s estimated that perhaps a quarter of the global population has a latent case, meaning cases in which individuals are not sick despite harboring the bacteria, but some percentage of them will eventually get seriously ill from their infections. When people develop this full-blown, pulmonary form of TB, it’s also when they’re likely to spread the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is designed to prevent adolescents and adults from advancing to the dangerous stage of an infection. An existing TB vaccine, which is known as BCG and dates back to 1921, can protect babies and young children against severe TB, but isn’t particularly effective in older people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those involved in the trial said it completed enrollment so quickly because it was designed to focus on sites in areas that previous epidemiological studies had identified as TB hotspots. TB is so pervasive in these communities that many people were eager to volunteer for a study, having a personal understanding of the potential impact of being able to prevent cases. Sponsors also credited the trial sites for working in their communities over time to build trust with people. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Community engagement was something that was built in at a very early stage at all the clinical trial sites,” said Alex Pym, the director of infectious disease at Wellcome, who earlier in his career worked on TB control in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, the trial was set to&lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2023/06/funding-commitment-m72-tb-vaccine-candidate" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; enroll 26,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers refined the protocol over time, and found that they could get an answer about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine with 20,000 volunteers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study is powered to measure a vaccine efficacy of about 50%, which the shot reached in an earlier Phase 2 study. Though researchers hope for even better results, they emphasize that having a tool that is 50% effective at reducing pulmonary TB could still have dramatic effects, given that there are millions of cases each year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to take three to five years, though it will depend on how quickly cases of pulmonary TB develop among participants, some of whom will receive the vaccine and some of whom will receive placebo doses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even so, the vaccine’s backers are already starting to make plans to move toward potential regulatory approval, manufacturing efforts, and an eventual rollout — including decisions on which groups to target and where to launch it first.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the long term, we have to make the vaccine available, accessible, and affordable,” said Alemnew Dagnew, who leads M72’s clinical development at Gates MRI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Author Gender in Elite Philosophy Journals&lt;br&gt;
by Eric Schwitzgebel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, the gender situation has been improving in philosophy. Women &lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2023/09/percentage-of-women-philosophy-majors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;now constitute about 40%&lt;/a&gt; of graduating majors in philosophy in the U.S., up from about 32% in the 1980s-2010s. There is, I think, substantially more awareness of gender issues and the desirability of gender diversity than there was fifteen years ago. And yet, &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/DiversityUS.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;at the highest levels of impact and prestige&lt;/a&gt;, philosophy remains &lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2025/03/the-gender-and-raceethnicity-of-authors.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;overwhelmingly male&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One measure of this is authorship in elite philosophy journals. For this post, I examined the past two years’ tables of contents of &lt;i&gt;Philosophical Review, Mind, Journal of Philosophy,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Noûs&lt;/i&gt;—widely considered to be the most elite general philosophy journals in mainstream Anglophone philosophy. (&lt;a href="https://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/best-general-philosophy-journals-2022.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Some rankings&lt;/a&gt; put &lt;i&gt;Philosophy &amp;amp; Phenomenological Research&lt;/i&gt; alongside these four.) I estimated the gender of each author of each article, commentary, or response (excluding book reviews and editorial prefaces), based on gender-typical name, gender-typical photo, pronoun use, and/or personal knowledge, generally using at least two criteria. Of 291 included authors, there were only two who were either non-binary or defied classification—in both cases, based on an expressed preference for they/them pronouns. There’s always a risk of mistake, but for the most part I expect that my gender classifications accurately reflect how the authors identify and are perceived, with at most a 1-2% error rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authorship Rates In Four Elite Philosophy Journals (Past Two Years):&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Women: 46 authorships&lt;br&gt;
Men: 243 authorships&lt;br&gt;
Nonbinary/unclassified: 2 authorships&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Percent women: 16%&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women now earn &lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2023/11/percent-of-us-philosophy-phd-recipients.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;about 30% of PhDs&lt;/a&gt; in the United States and constitute &lt;a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/data_on_profession/fy2024_demographic_statistic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;almost 30% of American Philosophical Association members&lt;/a&gt; who report their gender, so authorship in these journals is substantially more gender-skewed than faculty in the US. Of course, many authors are neither located nor received their PhD in the US, so these percentages aren’t strictly comparable. However, PhD and faculty percentages are &lt;a href="https://bpa.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021-BPA-SWIP-Report-Women-in-Philosophy-in-the-UK.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;broadly similar in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and, impressionistically, in other high-income Anglophone countries. (I’m less sure outside the English-speaking world, but researchers in non-Anglophone countries author only a small percentage of articles in elite Anglophone journals; see here for an analysis of the &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/Anglophone.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;insularity of Anglophone philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, one possible explanation of this skew is that women are more likely to specialize in ethics than in other areas of philosophy (see these &lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/11/percentage-of-women-at-apa-meetings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ten-year-old data&lt;/a&gt;), and these four journals publish relatively little ethics. To explore this possibility, I did two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I coded each article in the big four journals as either “ethics” or “non-ethics”, based on the title or the abstract (if the title was ambiguous). I included political philosophy, social philosophy, metaethics, and history of ethics as ethics. (Of course, there were some gray-area cases and judgment calls.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, I added two journals to my list: &lt;i&gt;Ethics&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Philosophy &amp;amp; Public Affairs&lt;/i&gt;, generally considered the two most elite ethics journals (though after the &lt;a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/05/22/editors-at-philosophy-will-launch-new-oa-journal/"&gt;editorial turmoil&lt;/a&gt; at PPA last year, it’s not clear whether this will remain true of PPA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the big four, I classified 60/291 (21%) authorships as ethics. (Perhaps this is a slight underrepresentation of ethics in these journals, relative to the proportion of research faculty in the Anglophone world who specialize in ethics?) In these journals, I found that indeed women have a higher percentage of ethics authorships than non-ethics authorships:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authorship by Gender in Big 4 Philosophy Journals Ethics vs. Non-Ethics&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Ethics: 17/60 (28% women)&lt;br&gt;
Non-ethics: 29/231 (13% women)&lt;br&gt;
[Fisher’s exact 2-tail, p = .005]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we juice up the sample size by adding in &lt;i&gt;Ethics&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PPA&lt;/i&gt;, we get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authorship by Gender in 6 Elite Philosophy Journals Ethics vs. Non-Ethics&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;Ethics: 40/142 (29% women)&lt;br&gt;
Non-ethics: 29/231 (13% women)&lt;br&gt;
[Fisher’s exact 2-tail, p &amp;lt; .001]
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strikingly, women appear to be more than twice as likely to author ethics articles than non-ethics articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2015/12/only-13-of-authors-in-five-leading.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ten years ago, I did some similar analyses,&lt;/a&gt; comparing ethics vs. non-ethics authorships in two-year bins every 20 years from 1955 to 2015. In those samples, too, I found women to author only a small percentage of articles in elite journals overall (13% in 2014-2015) and to be more likely to author in ethics, so the trends are historically consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ow do animals understand death? That is the question animating this story, which convention dictates I start with an anecdote. But which one? While working on the story a friend told me how his dog saw his closest canine friend run over; the dog becomes disconsolate and agitated whenever they pass the street where it happened. My algorithms surfaced a story about &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/grieving-goose-shows-new-rescue-friend-around-farm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a grief-stricken widower goose&lt;/a&gt; who found new love. Someone I follow on social media &lt;a href="https://x.com/TamarHaspel/status/1833172008340701515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;argued that&lt;/a&gt; it’s ethically acceptable to kill animals because they don’t know what death is. I read about a primatologist who runs an animal sanctuary in Costa Rica; every year, a monkey she rescued brings her latest baby to the sanctuary for introductions, but one year the monkey brought a dead baby. Perhaps she hoped a human who once helped her could help again. There was nothing the primatologist could do, though, and after several hours the mother monkey, seeming to admit defeat, screamed. &lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;p&gt;I read dozens of scientific papers—about a mother dingo who carried her dead pup for days, elephants who appear to bury their dead, dolphins who would not let a deceased podmate sink—and debates about how those behaviors should be interpreted. I often did so while cradling my cat Maya, then dying from kidney disease, and thought sometimes of Ingmar, my cat who died last winter from cancer. On the final night of her life, her body hollowed, she summoned the energy to visit her favorite spots, as if paying them a last visit. I thought often about the inevitable death of those I love, which troubles me constantly. I thought sometimes about my own death, which for now is less of a concern. I attended the passing of a goat named Caramel at the sanctuary where I volunteer. Goats have very large pupils, and near the end, as he lay on his side, they were like galaxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much of what matters most in our experience of life is found not in what is unique to us, but in what we share?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom, among scientists and much of the public as well, holds that animals know little about death. They perceive it, obviously, and may distinguish between dead and alive, but do not grasp it. When a rabbit runs from a fox, then, they flee pain rather than the end of experience. The successful fox, for his part, knows that his prey is immobile, not that they have ceased living. They have no concept of death; it is not part of their mental models, much less a source of anguish or concern or motivation. Or so the thinking goes. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mortals are they who can experience death as death. Animals cannot do this,” wrote the philosopher Martin Heidegger. “The knowledge of death is reflective and conceptual, and animals are spared it,” pronounced anthropologist Ernest Becker in &lt;em&gt;The Denial of Death&lt;/em&gt;. Becker was notably contemptuous of animals—“Inside they are anonymous,” he wrote. “They live and they disappear with the same thoughtlessness”—but even Charles Darwin, who embraced the mental commonalities between humans and other animals, thought them incapable of understanding that they could die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all that people now appreciate the minds of other animals, understanding death has remained a clear divide. In the last few years, though, more scientists have turned their attention to the subject. They argue that some exceptionally intelligent creatures can indeed comprehend death. The comprehension might be rudimentary compared to that of a typical 21st-century adult, but it’s close enough to blur the divide. And some researchers and scholars want to go even further: Understanding death, they argue, is not so complicated, is meaningful even in simpler forms, and may be shared by many creatures rather than just a few. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Far from being a divide, a knowledge of death may be something we have in common with other animals. Rather than framing this in terms of how their understandings resemble our own, we might consider how ours resemble theirs. In doing so we are confronted by a question with implications for how we relate to animals, and indeed to ourselves: How much of what matters most in our experience of death is found not in what is unique to us, but in what we share?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n late November of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;2008, Pansy, the elderly chimpanzee matriarch of a small troop living at a safari park in the city of Stirling, Scotland, fell ill with a respiratory virus. She was already in her 50s—ancient for a chimpanzee—and not strong enough to recover. Patsy started nesting on the ground instead of climbing up to the chimps’ usual sleeping platforms. The other chimps followed suit and started sleeping on the ground beside her. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An afternoon came when Pansy clearly wouldn’t live much longer. She found the strength to pull herself up to her platform one last time, lying down in a nest her daughter made the previous night. Her breathing was now labored; the end was near. The chimps’ caretaker thought about removing Pansy from the group and euthanizing her, but decided that would be traumatic. He also remembered the video cameras installed over the platforms for a research project on chimpanzee sleep patterns. He turned them on, thus recording the chimpanzees’ behaviors at the end of Pansy’s life and the hours following her death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="In Body Image" class="wp-image-1204426" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/DznxUT9k-Keim_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;amp;fit=scale&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;h=682&amp;amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;amp;w=1024&amp;amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/DznxUT9k-Keim_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/DznxUT9k-Keim_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/DznxUT9k-Keim_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chimpanzee deaths had been observed a few times before, but never in such intimate detail. “When we looked at the videotapes, I was just stunned,” recalls James Anderson, a primatologist at Kyoto University who studies primate cognition. “Nobody had ever seen this precise moment, and it was clear that the surviving chimpanzees understood that something momentous had happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As night fell, the three members of Pansy’s small troop were unusually attentive. They groomed and caressed her with unusual frequency. They peered into Pansy’s face as her breathing slowed and then stopped, at which point they gently shook her body. One of them, named Chippie, pounded on her chest—and then, when Pansy did not move, ran away. They slept poorly that night; Rosie, Pansy’s daughter, stayed up late and then slept beside her mother’s body, while the other two chimps huddled together and groomed one another as much that night as they would over the course of a month. Chippie “attacked” Pansy three more times—although those interactions could just as easily be interpreted as denial or anger, or an attempt to rouse her, wrote Anderson and colleagues in an &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/comments/S0960-9822(10)00145-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis of the event&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day zookeepers removed Pansy’s body. The chimps were “profoundly subdued,” wrote Anderson’s team, and for a week afterward they avoided the platform on which she had died. For weeks after that the chimpanzees remained subdued; they were lethargic, ate less than usual, and were unusually quiet. By all appearances they seemed to be grieving—not just the absence of Pansy, but her &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without death-related symbols or rituals, chimpanzees show several behaviors that recall human responses to the death of a close relative,” wrote the researchers. “Are humans uniquely aware of mortality? We propose that chimpanzees’ awareness of death has been underestimated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand death is to know that you can die; and that you and everyone else will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That this was a tentative, controversial claim to make about humanity’s closest living relative speaks to just how radical the idea was in scientific circles. Some scientists pushed back: Though Anderson and colleagues were careful to say the chimps’ behavior &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be evidence of awareness of death, not that it &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;, they accused Anderson of &lt;a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/6/monograph/chapter/763971/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;careless, anthropomorphic speculation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controversial as it was, though, the idea had entered the realm of serious consideration. It catalyzed the field of comparative thanatology, as the scientific study of death-related cognition, emotion, and behavior in other animals is known. Scores of studies have since been published. We are still far from knowing what they think, but it helps to start by reflecting on what it means to understand death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not the same thing as recognizing death. Many ants remove dead kin from their colonies, but this is a reflexive rather than reflective process. Dab a living ant with oleic acid, a chemical produced by decomposition, and their nestmates will carry them out even as they struggle. No true understanding is involved. In a similar vein, opossums and hognose snakes feigning death to escape from predators need not realize they are feigning &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;. They’re simply performing an instinctive set of movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, by contrast, psychologists have codified a mature concept of death as containing several components: non-functionality, irreversibility, causality, universality, personal mortality, and inevitability. To understand death is to know that it ends physical and mental functions; that the dead cannot return to life; that death is caused by the breakdown of life-sustaining processes; that all living beings can die; that you can die; and that you and everyone else &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; die. This understanding can have more layers, such as belief in an afterlife, and the ostensibly immature understandings possessed by children are a subject to which we’ll return, but it’s a foundational framework. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most scientists who study the topic would agree that no animal has this level of understanding, though a few species—certain great apes, elephants, and some cetaceans—have the cognitive sophistication to grasp non-functionality, irreversibility, and perhaps causality and a limited sense of universality. Beyond them, though, understanding death in any meaningful way is considered rare or nonexistent. Certainly it’s not something one would expect to find.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet to Susana Monsó, a philosopher and author of &lt;em&gt;Playing Possum: How Animals Understand Death&lt;/em&gt;, the belief that death is difficult to understand is mistaken. It overemphasizes the mature human understanding of death. Instead Monsó proposes that only two components suffice for what she calls a “minimal concept of death”: irreversibility and non-functionality. To recognize that an animal no longer does what they used to, and realize that this state is permanent, is the essence of understanding death. It is at once simple and profound, and the cognitive requirements are basic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanisms for distinguishing between animate and inanimate entities emerged early in evolutionary history and are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763414003546?casa_token=8OEX8ujN_YkAAAAA:1elirsTJy9kvJoeO9XaBs3p1D1ci8VoJ6e3bmjlWJEpZGoKBFJWz0_cHFGr8SIzJz2h0hNSiaw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;widespread among animals&lt;/a&gt;. Add the ability to generate expectations about how an animal ought to behave, then an encounter with a dead body, and voilà: It is an opportunity to recategorize that body from one who does what is expected of them to one that does not, and will not again. A concept of death can be born. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From my point of view, death is nothing but broken bodies,” says Antonio Osuna-Mascaró, an animal cognition researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. Take away the big ideas and mythology, he says, “and we end up facing death as death should be looked at in nature. We find out that understanding death is recognizing when a body is broken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This minimal concept is a foundation, say Monsó and Osuna-Mascaró. Many animals will be able to add other aspects of death, such as causality and a knowledge of their own mortality—not necessarily that they will die, but that they could—yielding an even richer awareness. How many species are capable of this? “It’s too early to give a well-grounded answer to that question,” Monsó says. “But definitely way more species than scientific and philosophical history would have you believe.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;J&lt;/span&gt;ames Anderson thinks dolphins and elephants are capable of understanding death at a level “roughly equivalent to a human adolescent.” When I asked what he thought of Monsó’s ideas, he agreed that non-functionality and irreversibility are likely the first components of death that an animal may grasp. But to him, this minimal concept of death contains such a dim impression of what is being understood that it barely counts as an understanding. To be meaningful, it needs something more: a grasp of causality, perhaps of universality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Anderson answered, I was reminded, however, of my experiences with death as a child—first a rabbit, later a babysitter. I understood those deaths in terms of irreversibility and non-functionality, with only a faint knowledge of what caused them and none of death’s universality. By the standards of developmental psychology my understanding was far from mature—yet those were still powerful experiences. “I don’t think universality is required at all. I don’t think inevitability is required at all. There are so many things about the concept of death that I think are superfluous. They are not required for having a concept of death that is meaningful to us,” says Osuna-Mascaró. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="In Body Image" class="wp-image-1204428" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/h1jnDjnQ-Keim_BREAKER-3.png?auto=compress&amp;amp;fit=scale&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;h=675&amp;amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;amp;w=1024&amp;amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/h1jnDjnQ-Keim_BREAKER-3.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/h1jnDjnQ-Keim_BREAKER-3.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/h1jnDjnQ-Keim_BREAKER-3.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A MOTHER’S LOVE: &lt;/strong&gt;A mother macaque and her infant embrace.

Some children construed death as a sleep from which one could not wake. Which isn’t to say some animals conceive of death this way—although I do wonder—but to illustrate how even a concept of death that contains a faulty grasp of non-functionality and irreversibility, those most elemental components, can be powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson recommended I talk to André Gonçalves, a fellow primatologist at Kyoto University with a particular interest in comparative thanatology. Gonçalves had reservations about the ability of animals to flexibly extend a concept of death from one occurrence to other situations. Humans are especially good at this sort of thinking, Gonçalves said. Though some animals display the necessary cognitive abilities, for many it may be difficult or impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also talked about anthropocentrism—the tendency to think of humans as superior to and fundamentally different from other animals—and whether it has made comparative thanatologists reluctant to recognize understandings of death in other animals. To Gonçalves, being open to the possibility that other animals can understand death is the opposite of anthropocentric. His colleagues are simply studying this phenomenon rigorously. It is difficult to measure and to interpret; even highly suggestive behaviors have many possible explanations. Seeming anthropocentrism is actually rigor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes me as anthropocentric, however, is not some sense of human superiority among comparative thanatologists, or close-mindedness to the richness of animal experience, but rather how the default hypothesis is always that animals do not understand death. Why start there, rather than from the position that animals might, or even that they do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An instructive example of an excessive reluctance—in my eyes—to recognize animal understandings of death involves the discourse around why mammal mothers sometimes carry their infants for days or even weeks after they die. This has been observed in many species, including &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Sea_Otter_in_the_Eastern_Pacific_Oce/EpHY-DEpj50C?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;bsq=dead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sea otters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376635713000387?casa_token=K0V3CzaYxl4AAAAA:P2tZ--Py_tI7aGoCdSZwMPptFoW58JkxsmkIIVn5qrnkVHn7vlR8lUPfLqqjN0TY2HrdJC9Qvg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dingoes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944200618300473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;some cetaceans&lt;/a&gt;, but is &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;especially well-documented in primates&lt;/a&gt;. At a glance it seems maladaptive: It’s tiring, makes it harder to forage, and leaves mothers more vulnerable to predation. What, then, could explain it? &lt;/p&gt;

The most obvious is that a mother’s love for her baby is not sundered by death. Mothers still care; they are grieving. There are other possible explanations, though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="In Body Image" class="wp-image-1204427" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/QgZ1PGSh-Keim_BREAKER-2.png?auto=compress&amp;amp;fit=scale&amp;amp;fm=png&amp;amp;h=1024&amp;amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;amp;w=778&amp;amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/QgZ1PGSh-Keim_BREAKER-2.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/QgZ1PGSh-Keim_BREAKER-2.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/QgZ1PGSh-Keim_BREAKER-2.png?q=65&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe carrying one’s dead baby is a form of practice that improves future mothering. Perhaps, for primates in societies where females benefit from the status conferred by motherhood, they carry the corpse in order to keep getting extra grooming and support. It has been suggested that some primates are &lt;a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10192639/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;attracted to anything mammal-like&lt;/a&gt;, whether it’s a living baby or a corpse or just a stick with hair attached. In fact mothers may not even recognize their baby any more; they might perceive the corpse as an interesting baby-shaped object. Or it could be that female mammals are innately attracted to infants and want to nuzzle them, dead or alive. In fact, mothers may not even realize their babies have died, especially when the causes are not obvious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confronted with these uncertainties, where should one end up? There is no clear scientific answer. My own hunch is that mothers know their babies are dead—perhaps not immediately, but certainly after a few days—and cannot let go, figuratively or literally. It seems the most parsimonious explanation; the one truest to the experience of motherhood. Alecia Carter, an anthropologist at University College London, favors that explanation for &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.192206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the baboons she has studied&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://disi.org/do-baboons-understand-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Many Minds&lt;/em&gt; podcast she called infant corpse-carrying “an extension of maternal care and inability to break the maternal bond.” As for the behavior’s deeper function, Carter said the best explanation “is that it’s a form of grief management.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An understanding of death is not required to grieve, but it perhaps makes grief more powerful. The presence of grief in animals is also debated, as seen in the famous case of Tahlequah, the orca who held her dead calf above water for 17 days in the summer of 2018, swimming more than 1,000 miles and becoming a global celebrity. Some scientists called this grief; others resisted. They insisted that it was impossible to know for sure and that, lacking this certainty, the default explanation should be that Tahlequah failed to realize her calf was dead and simply hoped she would revive. To think otherwise was a matter of faith, not science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a case study in anthropocentrism. And I would offer this: It is possible to imagine that Tahlequah both grieved her baby’s death and hoped she would revive. Many of us have stood beside the casket of someone we loved, looking for movement. Of course we know they are dead. The desperate, irrational wish to reverse what cannot be reversed is part of our grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n early 2024, researchers studying Asian elephants in northern Bengal &lt;a href="https://threatenedtaxa.org/index.php/JoTT/article/view/8826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported something extraordinary&lt;/a&gt;: Five accounts of elephant calves found buried in tea plantation irrigation ditches, with their legs aboveground and pointed toward the sky. The soil around them was patted level. Footsteps and dung deposits showed that the burials were performed by the calves’ herds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burials took place at night. Nearby villagers heard loud trumpeting but none witnessed the events. Later autopsies showed the calves were in poor health and died of natural causes, not from drowning in the ditches. Bruise patterns on their bodies suggested they were carried long distances by their legs and trunks. A camera trap snapped a picture of two elephants walking together, one dragging the tiny figure of a calf by her trunk across a plantation’s red earth. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers—Parveen Kaswan, an officer in the Indian Forest Service, and Akashdeep Roy, a political ecologist at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research—interpreted the burials as intentional. Burial “reflects the care and affection of the herd member(s),” they wrote. Although elephants are celebrated for their intelligence and social complexity, nothing like this had ever been reported. Headlines followed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, mortuary practices—rituals and customs, such as burial, for disposing of the deceased—emerged roughly 100,000 years ago. Anthropologists consider it a defining moment for &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, in which a recognition of death combined with symbolic thought to give deeper meaning to loss and also to life. That elephants might have their own such practices was viscerally powerful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If an animal did comprehend the inevitability of death, what then? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were, of course, other explanations. Perhaps the elephants indeed carried their dead calves but lost hold while crossing ditches, then dislodged loose soil from the banks as they tried to recover them. Distinguishing intentional from inadvertent is difficult “unless we directly observe the elephants carrying a carcass to a particular site for ‘burial,’ ” opine elephant biologist Nachiketha Sharma of Kyoto University and Sanjeeta Pokharel, a behavioral ecologist with the Indian Institute of Science.* “We are not dismissing the possibility that elephants can or do bury their dead”—but from what was observed, who could know?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Sharma and Pokharel published &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-019-00739-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;three detailed accounts&lt;/a&gt; of Asian elephants attending to dead or dying kin. One involved two adult females seen beside the body of an elderly female who died from disease; when forest officials chased them away to inspect the body, they found withered leaves and twigs deposited around the dead elephant’s head. Once again it is tempting to impute some greater significance, some ritual of farewell or gift for the afterlife. Once again it is impossible to know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Placing twigs and leaves could be a symbolic gesture. However, there could be other explanations,” say Sharma and Pokharel. Perhaps elephants dropped what was in their mouths, or lost interest in eating, while inspecting the dead elephant. “We can only speculate,” they say. Yet the fact that such speculation is plausible speaks to the marvelous intelligence of elephants and raises the question of how complex their understanding of death could become. Might some elephants comprehend not only that death is the end of the being they once knew, but also that death will someday come, for themselves and for others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding that oneself could die is arguably not too complicated. Monsó gives the example of a monkey who sees other monkeys die after falling from trees or being eaten by leopards. To associate death with those events, and then extrapolate that more monkeys—including oneself—could experience a similar fate were they to fall or be eaten is not so difficult. It requires induction and analogical reasoning, which are found in many animals, and the opportunity to learn about death from experience, of which nature provides no shortage. Quite a few animals might be able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about understanding that one &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; die, though? As will everyone else? For Monsó, understanding death’s inevitability and the full scope of universality is likely a uniquely human trait, or at least dependent on the ability to talk about it. Modern humans, after all, learn through stories or lessons that death comes to all. Monsó thinks it unlikely that other animal communication systems have the conceptual abstraction necessary to convey this. &lt;/p&gt;

He is fascinated by how chimpanzees and other primates communicate as they attend to their dead. “They are certainly expressing communication about what has happened,” he says. “What we don’t have any evidence of yet—and this will be an amazing step, if that happens—is if there’s some signal,” such as a vocalization or gesture, “that conveys &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt;.” Pokharel and Sharma recorded the trumpeting of elephants beside their dead, and think it possible that elephants speak about death, but this has yet to be studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anderson thinks chimpanzees may be able to learn about death’s universality and inevitability. Pokharel and Sharma say the same about elephants, but “empirically substantiating this would be extremely difficult, if not impossible.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet again we are confronted with the tension—central to comparative thanatology, and indeed to the study of animal behavior—between what may be possible and what can be scientifically ascertained. It is important for scientists to be careful in their empirical claims, but the limits of our measurements should not prescribe the limits of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if an animal did comprehend the inevitability of death, what then? The late geneticist Danny Brower hypothesized that awareness of one’s own mortality brings such paralyzing fear and anxiety that it’s an evolutionary dead end. Humanity survived the realization by devising intellectual workarounds. “Man cannot endure his own littleness unless he can translate it into meaningfulness,” wrote Ernest Becker in &lt;em&gt;The Denial of Death&lt;/em&gt;. In the 1980s, Becker’s work inspired terror management theory, which postulated that much of human behavior is shaped by a deep-seated fear of death. The theory also distinguished between complex forms of terror management—transcendent values, religious frameworks—and simpler ones, like contributing to one’s community and caring for loved ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to psychologist Tom Pyszczynski, one of the theory’s architects, there are three cognitive requirements: the ability to think symbolically, to think about the future, and to reflect upon one’s own life and self. Forms of these capacities are found in many species. I asked Pyszczynski: Might some animals engage in mental activities akin to what is described in his theory? Not the complex forms, but the simpler ones. Might a monk parakeet find some sense of greater purpose in adding sticks to the car-sized, multi-generational colonial nests in which they live? Could a gorilla groom a friend with extra care, knowing such moments are finite? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is certainly possible. I don’t think we know,” said Pyszczynski. He is uncomfortable speculating about the inner lives of other animals, but “every decade or so, we learn that things are a lot more complicated—and other animals are more sophisticated and capable—than we used to think.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here exist caves &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0012496621030017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;used continuously for thousands of years&lt;/a&gt; by hibernating bears. Inevitably some bears die during hibernation and so the caves are full of skeletons. Might not some bears—creatures whose intelligence is little-studied but may compare to that of great apes—look upon and smell those remains, grasp their ancience even as they feel time’s passage in their own bones, and intuit what must happen? How might a monk parakeet conceive of the greater good? Those are speculative, possibly unknowable questions, but others are more immediate and tractable. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At his lab at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Osuna-Mascaró is developing methods for testing whether Goffin’s cockatoos comprehend irreversibility and non-functionality. Another question is whether that understanding can be flexibly applied, and also how readily it is acquired. If a fox can come to understand death as they hunt mice, how many must they kill for the lesson to sink in? Can they make inferences from when they chased beetles as a kit? And perhaps researchers could adapt methods used in studies of terror management theory, in which people are presented with reminders of death as a way of assessing whether it’s on their mind and how they cope. “Expose the animal to a dead conspecific and then see if that leads them to engage in more nurturing or protective behavior,” suggests Pyszczynski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many more species need to be studied, too. Comparative thanatology has focused mostly on primates, with elephants and cetaceans also receiving some attention. Few other animals have been studied, a disparity that reflects circumstance rather than potential. Parrots are obvious candidates, says Osuna-Mascaró. Anderson mentioned wildebeests and monogamous birds. A few years ago a camera trap set up for an 8-year-old Arizona boy’s science fair project &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/eth.12709?casa_token=9jsqUepYkW8AAAAA:VtQ9cBCyERSoJk1lSrjf53XxDxdgrPqcFiSO0G41Esv7_s1EIrIPky9ms-eKE6nkeOqlZkAjpSwWEyA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recorded a herd of collared peccaries&lt;/a&gt; who visited a fallen comrade for 10 days, sleeping beside her body and defending it from coyotes.

Some are ethical: Gonçalves, for example, balks at playing recordings of a deceased chimpanzee to her family in order to see how they react. Other limits are fundamental. “There are certain questions that we can ask, but that we’re not going to be able to address scientifically,” says Monsó. “That’s okay.” Is there any way to truly know whether my cat Ingmar, visiting her old haunts on her final night, knew the end was near? Or was she simply seeking psychological comfort in a time of great pain? I want neither certainty nor the rigorous weighing of competing hypotheses. And even what we do understand is necessarily partial; an ocean exists between scientific description and lived experience. It may be true that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11097-023-09945-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;grief emerges from dissonance&lt;/a&gt; between a brain’s model of the world and its new reality, but those words are incommensurate with the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should we do with our knowledge and our uncertainties? “One question is paramount,” says anthropologist Barbara King. “How might research around animal responses to death compel us to be better and do better for animals?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are low-hanging implications. Anderson mentioned the importance of allowing chimpanzees in captivity to spend time with deceased kin, rather than immediately removing the body, so that they might understand what has happened and have some sense of closure. Monsó made the same point about companion animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important implications, though, are in how we relate to animals. In the study of calf burial in Indian tea plantations, the researchers described how local people’s attitudes reflect their appreciation of elephant sentience. To believe they bury their calves and mourn their dead “strengthens the morale of coexistence,” the researchers wrote. People there care about elephant conservation less because of their ecological roles than because of the ethical regard due to them as intelligent beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King stresses that understanding death should not be a litmus test. Every being deserves our respect. And given how many of us spend much of our lives oblivious to death, we ought not find animals wanting for being incapable of more. But to know what death may mean to other animals is to take each life seriously and to honor them. We are called, says King, to consider the lives we treat so casually: animals kept in captivity for entertainment, or killed for the sake of knowledge or a soon-forgotten meal, whose suffering may be compounded by an awareness of death and loss. Where people follow those ethical implications will vary, but that animals could share with us some understanding of death, not necessarily identical to our own but similar in some ways—and in ways that matter deeply to our own experience—is grounds for a deeper kinship.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is not to deny that some human understandings may be singular. If anything is truly unique to us, I think, it is our ability to refract death through our extraordinary capacity to imagine possible futures and alternate histories. Perhaps no other animal is capable of being annoyed at a loved one’s irritating habit, then feeling sadness at the thought of how someday that habit will be remembered with affection and regret. Perhaps no other animal can be consumed by how death could have been averted, or what they might have done differently. Perhaps no other animal judges themselves for this, or forgives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is more important, though: the differences between how humans and other animals understand death, or the similarities? To me it is the latter. The common essence of life’s preciousness and the finality of its loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the thanatological literature, much attention is given to the ritual trappings of death: the ceremonies, the mythology, the symbolism. Those, it is said, are deeply human. I think about the peccaries’ vigil and of the funerals I have attended and will. Long after the funeral is over, we still stand by the grave.  &lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These analyses used imputed data to address missing primary and secondary outcomes for the 18% of patients in the trial who were lost to follow-up and did not provide data at 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this provides a different approach that has the potential to slow this rapid move towards knee replacements for early OA,” Cicuttini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.oarsijournal.com/article/S1063-4584(22)00746-4/fulltext"&gt;earlier systematic review&lt;/a&gt;, which Cicuttini co-authored, found consistent preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting metformin had chondroprotective, immunomodulatory, and pain-reducing effects in knee OA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Metformin has a whole lot of different actions or benefits on joint cartilage, on low-grade inflammation, on the metabolism,” Cicuttini commented to &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt;. “What’s also attractive about metformin is it doesn’t cause hypoglycemia; you can use it in normal healthy people, you don’t have to monitor their blood sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was some weight loss in both groups (mean change, −1.8 kg in the metformin group and −1.2 kg in the placebo group), but Cicuttini said the impact on OA symptoms was independent of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some patients experienced adverse events, with 15% of the metformin group reporting diarrhea compared with 8% of the placebo group, but there were high levels of adherence to the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatologist &lt;a href="https://www.arthritiscentre.com.au/dr-anita-wluka.html"&gt;Anita Wluka, MBBS,&lt;/a&gt; PhD, of the Alfred Hospital and Monash University — who was also a co-author on the study — said to &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt; that “metformin ticks all the metabolic boxes, and it’s cheap as chips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the findings, physiotherapist &lt;a href="https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/bpatterson"&gt;Brooke Patterson, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, of La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, said there are numerous trials looking for medications to help with OA, but it is challenging to find effects because of the nature of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got all these different subgroups within the 50 participants that are getting the intervention, but only a small proportion of those might respond to one treatment,” she said. “I would just recommend that people with OA talk to not only their doctor but a range of health professionals or get their doctor to try and understand potentially what are some of their risk factors” and their OA disease phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The study was funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia. Cicuttini reported receiving funding from the NHMRC Investigator Grant and being on the advisory board of Magellan Stem Cells.

Unlike other digestive diseases, IBS doesn't cause physical damage to the digestive tract, but significantly impacts quality of life due to its disruption of the brain-gut connection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;April is marked as IBS Awareness Month, aiming to spread more knowledge about this condition.

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pariksha Rao said, “Despite its prevalence in India many suffer without proper diagnosis or management strategies. Modern lifestyles, increasing stress levels and changing dietary patterns have contributed to rising cases across the country. There’s also increasing evidence that IBS is closely linked to the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis — the two-way communication system between our brain and digestive system. When this system is out of balance, it can make the gut overly sensitive or change how the muscles in the intestines move, causing IBS symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How diet affects IBS symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet plays a crucial role in managing IBS. Pariksha Rao revealed, “Indian food is often rich in spices, fiber, and fermented ingredients, which can either help or harm those with IBS, depending on how the body reacts. Traditional diets may offer some relief, but modern diets — which are increasingly full of processed foods, sugar, and fats — can make symptoms worse.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She explained, “One of the major triggers for IBS is food that is high in FODMAPs [Fermentable Oligosaccharides (e.g. fructans and galacto-oligosaccharides) Disaccharides (e.g. lactose) Monosaccharides (e.g. excess fructose) and Polyols (e.g. sorbitol and mannitol)] — short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. Common FODMAP foods in the Indian diet include garlic, onions and fruits like apples. These foods ferment in the gut, creating gas and causing bloating, pain and irregular bowel movements.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2021/11/26/550x309/pexels-daria-shevtsova-1070984_1637902115863_1637902151004.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)" title="Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Avoid gassy founds: You need to avoid foods such as beans, cabbage, cauliflower, and lettuce during the initial days of your periods to make sure the bloating doesn't get enhanced.(Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expert added, “Caffeine and carbonated drinks are also triggers for many IBS patients. They can stimulate the gut too much and lead to diarrhea or gas. Artificial sweeteners like sorbitol, xylitol, and mannitol — often found in sugar-free products — are also known to cause bloating and discomfort because they are not fully absorbed in the gut.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing IBS through balanced diets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pariksha Rao suggested, “A balanced diet, rich in the right kind of fiber and low in irritants, can make a big difference. Probiotics — found in yogurt, kefir, or supplements — can help restore a healthy gut microbiome and reduce symptoms. However, fiber intake should be monitored. For people with IBS-D (diarrhea-dominant IBS), too much fiber can worsen symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to her, what works best is a personalised approach. Pariksha Rao said, “Some people may benefit from reducing dairy or gluten, while others might need to stay away from specific vegetables or fruits. Eating smaller meals, staying hydrated, and avoiding foods that are hard to digest or cause gas are all recommended steps. Keeping a food diary can also help identify which foods trigger symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2022/07/01/550x309/jusfilm-43seK8CwOGM-unsplash_1656685190192_1656685334925.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Ginger: Ginger helps speed up the process of the movement of food through the GI tract while protecting the gut.

In India, as awareness grows and more people seek professional advice, better management is becoming possible. With the right combination of diet, probiotics, and stress-relief practices, people living with IBS can enjoy a better quality of life. As we observe IBS Awareness Month this April, it’s the perfect time to start making thoughtful food choices and take care of both our gut and mind.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

The first is that a person's earwax can actually convey a surprising amount of information about them – both trivial and important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, the vast majority of people of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10886-014-0533-y" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;European or African descent&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;i id="wet" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;wet&lt;/i&gt; earwax, which is yellow or orange in colour and sticky. However, 95% of East Asian people have &lt;i id="dry" class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;dry &lt;/i&gt;earwax, which is grey and non-sticky. The gene responsible for producing either wet or dry earwax is called &lt;i id="abcc11," class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;ABCC11, &lt;/i&gt;which also happens to be responsible for whether a person has smelly armpits. Around 2% of people – mostly those in the dry earwax category – have a version of this gene which means their armpits &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/dependence-of-deodorant-usage-on-abcc11-genotype-scope-for-person" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;have no odour&lt;/a&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, perhaps the most useful earwax-related discoveries relate to what the sticky stuff in our ears can reveal about our health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="important-clues" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="important-clues" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Important clues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In 1971, Nicholas L Petrakis, a professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco, found that Caucasian, African-American and German women in the USA, who all had "wet earwax", had an approximately four-fold higher chance of dying from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.173.3994.347" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; than Japanese and Taiwanese women with "dry" earwax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;More recently in 2010, researchers from the Tokyo Institute of Technology took blood samples from 270 female patients with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ar.iiarjournals.org/content/30/12/5189" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;invasive breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and 273 female volunteers who acted as controls.

The key, it turns out, is down to the waxy secretions' ability to reflect the inner chemical reactions taking place inside the body – a person's metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;The researchers identified 27 compounds in earwax that served as a kind of "fingerprint" for cancer diagnosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Many diseases in living organisms are metabolic," says Nelson Roberto Antoniosi Filho, a professor of chemistry at the Federal University of Goiás in Brazil, who lists &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/diabetes#tab=tab_1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3941741/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5555796/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10792406/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; as examples. "In these cases, mitochondria – the cell organelles responsible for converting lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins into energy – begin to function differently to those in healthy cells. They start to produce different chemical substances and may even stop producing others." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Antoniosi Filho's lab have discovered that earwax concentrates this great diversity of substances more than other biological fluids such as blood, urine, sweat, and tears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It makes a lot of sense because there's not a lot of turnover in earwax," says Bruce Kimball, a chemical ecologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre, a research institute based in Philadelphia. "It kind of builds up, and so there's certainly a reason to think that it might be a good place to capture long-term snapshots of changes in metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;&lt;span id="tricky-diagnoses" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="tricky-diagnoses" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Tricky diagnoses&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;With this in mind, Antoniosi Filho and his team are developing the "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48121-4" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cerumenogram&lt;/a&gt;" – a diagnostic tool they claim can accurately predict whether a person has certain forms of cancer based on their earwax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a 2019 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48121-4" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;study,&lt;/a&gt; Antoniosi Filho's team collected earwax samples from 52 cancer patients who had been diagnosed with either lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukaemia. The researchers also took earwax from 50 healthy subjects. They then analysed the samples using a method which can accurately detect the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) – chemicals that evaporate easily in air.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers identified 27 compounds in earwax that served as a kind of "fingerprint" for cancer diagnosis. In other words, the team could predict with 100% accuracy whether someone had cancer (either lymphoma, carcinoma, or leukaemia) based on the concentrations of these 27 molecules. Interestingly, the test could not distinguish between different types of cancer, suggesting that the molecules are produced either by, or as a response to, cancer cells from all these types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Although cancer consists of hundreds of diseases, from a metabolic point of view, cancer is a single biochemical process, which can be detected at any stage through the evaluation of specific VOCs," says Antoniosi Filho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While in 2019 the team identified 27 VOCs, they are currently focusing on a small number of these that are exclusively produced by cancer cells as part of their unique metabolism. In as-yet unpublished work, Antoniosi Filho says they have also shown that the cerumenogram is able to detect the metabolic disturbances that occur in pre-cancerous stages, where cells exhibit abnormal changes that could potentially lead to cancer, but are not yet cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Considering that medicine indicates that most cancers diagnosed at stage 1 have up to a 90% cure rate, it is conceivable that the success in treatment will be much higher with the diagnosis of pre-cancer stages," says Antoniosi Filho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l69qh0.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC Earwax helps to trap invaders such as bacteria and fungi before they can enter our heads (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Earwax helps to trap invaders such as bacteria and fungi before they can enter our heads (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/ BBC)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The research group is also studying whether the metabolic changes caused by the onset of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's could also be picked up by such a device, although this work is in the early stages.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"In the future, we hope that the cerumenogram will become a routine clinical examination, preferably every six months, that allows, with a small portion of earwax, to simultaneously diagnose diseases such as diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's, as well as evaluate metabolic changes resulting from other health conditions," says Antoniosi Filho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Brazil, the Amaral Carvalho Hospital has recently adopted the cerumenogram as a diagnostic and monitoring technique for cancer treatment, says Antoniosi Filho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Musah is also hopeful that her research will one day help people suffering from Ménière's disease, a condition for which there is currently no cure.

That's on average. Mistakes happen because we're so often rushed and take shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of those shortcuts happen based on how frequently we see a problem in clinical practice. For example, if someone comes in and they say, 'It burns when I urinate.' Yes, it could be a urinary tract infection, but it could also be a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia or gonorrhea, and that needs a separate test, not just a urine culture," Gorfinkel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So, landing on a diagnosis after the first symptom we hear, and not listening to the whole story, is risky."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another big problem, which Gorfinkel believes is also accelerated by AI, is that doctors aren't personally connecting enough with their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Medicine isn't just a pill. It's very much the person who's providing it. It's that interaction," she highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the bottom line is patients shouldn't be afraid to ask more questions, to get more answers, even if it means challenging their doctor. And if that doctor should act angry or defensively, that by itself needs to be addressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8583084"&gt;  &lt;p id="8583084" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/incorrect-medical-diagnosis-people-received-16-680b76df43f2b__700.jpg" alt="A parent soothing a crying baby, illustrating an incorrect medical diagnosis." title="A parent soothing a crying baby, illustrating an incorrect medical diagnosis."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I took my 1 day old to A&amp;amp;E and I was told I was a overprotective new mum, and my daughters "movements" were normal reflexes for a newborn. turns out she was having multiple seizures every few seconds and had brain damage from lack of oxygen at birth.

"One thing that would help is making sure that we're communicating with the healthcare workers on the team," Gorfinkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether it's a specialist or a physiotherapist, we just want to make sure that their understanding and our understanding [of a particular case] match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Open charting for patients is one of the ways that makes a difference. It allows patients to see their records, follow them, and be proactive in their care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice engages us, and we care more as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing worth mentioning is that difficult, uncommon diagnoses are often delayed (for a variety of reasons). Because of this, Gorfinkel believes that it's important for clinicians to adapt and slow down their thinking as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the pieces of the puzzle don't fit, patients shouldn't be afraid to say, 'Wait a second, what about this symptom that doesn't quite fit the picture?' As I mentioned, having the sense that you've been heard by itself is important medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes, it's being threatened by AI, but it certainly hasn't been lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8583029"&gt;  &lt;p id="8583029" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/incorrect-medical-diagnosis-people-received-8-680b6e81705a9__700.jpg" alt="Man in discomfort, holding his head, possibly reflecting on an incorrect medical diagnosis." title="Man in discomfort, holding his head, possibly reflecting on an incorrect medical diagnosis."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;My dad suffered a head injury and then constant headaches for 6 weeks.

Was only rushed to hospital on blue lights when he stopped walking and talking.

"If there's a feeling that you just aren't better, or if there are unanswered questions, asking them is really important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People with family doctors actually live longer because they have one conductor who sees the big picture instead of multiple specialists trying to [glue together the pieces]," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-11"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorfinkel acknowledges that doctors' attitude also plays a role in these cases. "I think misdiagnosis frequently comes from overconfidence, and there's nothing more humbling than the practice of medicine," she said. "The best doctors know that and aren't afraid of eating humble pie when it's served."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that we want doctors to be experienced, but at the same time, we should respect those who can admit when they're not certain or when they lack experience in treating a certain problem. "These are physicians who keep overconfidence in check and know that hubris is the bedfellow of misdiagnosis," Gorfinkel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Ipsos Global Trustworthiness Index &lt;a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2024-11/ipsos-global-trustworthiness-index-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; that doctors and scientists are considered the world's most trustworthy professions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across 28 countries from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/around-the-world" class=" staff-link"&gt;around the world&lt;/a&gt; that took part, doctors came in first with an average of 58% of the global population claiming they have full confidence in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unreasonable to expect that the 11% that we mentioned in the intro can be brought down to 0.

The most prevalent type is Type 2 diabetes, which emerges when blood sugar becomes difficult to control, often due to weight issues, lack of &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/exercise" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; or genetic predisposition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; has clarified that Type 2 diabetes arises when insulin production falters, a reality for about one in ten people over 40 in Britain. Foods high in sugar can trigger increases in blood sugar levels, and everyday items can have hidden sugars that exacerbate this issue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Prolonged high blood sugar can cause serious &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; complications, including organ damage and heightened chances of strokes and heart disease. Recognising which food items spike your blood sugar is thus essential in managing diabetes, as highlighted by the &lt;a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/seven-foods-diabetics-should-avoid-30630012" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;Daily Record.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/food-and-drink" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; deemed &lt;a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/healthy-eating" rel="Follow" target="_self" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" data-content-type="section-topic"&gt;healthy&lt;/a&gt; might adversely affect blood sugar.

Because of this, diabetic people should moderate their grape consumption, particularly if they are prone to high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"If you consider a serving of dried fruit is only a tablespoon and packs in 20g carbs total sugar, you can see how easily this happens."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diabetes.co.uk also points out that it's not usually necessary to cut down on fruit consumption, but maintaining a food diary could be beneficial in monitoring your intake. The British Dietetic Association (BDA) highlights the importance of steering clear of high Glycaemic Index (GI) foods, stating: "Each time you have a sugary or starchy food or drink, the blood glucose level in your body rises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Some of these foods are quickly digested and cause quick and sharp rises in your blood glucose levels – they are called high GI foods and drinks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conversely, low GI foods take longer to digest and result in a more gradual increase in blood glucose. These are often referred to as 'slow-release' carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31520419" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Which foods can help to lower blood sugar levels?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some foods that may aid in balancing blood sugar levels:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Seafood&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Broccoli&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lentils&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sauerkraut&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Berries&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Avocado&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Oats&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Citrus fruit&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Yogurt&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/newsletter-preference-centre/?utm_source=newslettersignupfooter" target="_blank" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt; &lt;b&gt;If you want ideas and inspiration to plan your next UK adventure plus selected offers and competitions, sign up for our 2Chill weekly newsletter here&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 07:49:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOMU1xS1RWSmFOc09yRHhLLVE2LVdpUmhsMUNBVjQwcUdhalVEWE5LRWNSX1pFcEI1eF80cHp0clJnTFZxWlVnNDZKdFN3RUZTVEgtN0JBT3ZoT1hVOFp1b2NXNnI2UlBZalhkYXhfczctaFYzSVdnXzdvTkN1cVVvdGZB</guid></item></channel></rss>
