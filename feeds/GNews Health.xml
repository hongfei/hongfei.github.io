while taking phentermine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brady Henderson, 52, from Atlanta, Georgia, was desperate to lose weight and he managed to get a prescription for the appetite suppressant phentermine, sold under the brand name Adipex-P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The interaction of the two substances can lead to a range of potential health concerns including an increased heart rate, impaired liver function, excessive drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, phentermine has also been known to cause paranoia and other psychotic symptoms due to its structural similarity to amphetamines such as meth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on Mr Henderson's case, Dr Colin Haile from University of Houston's Drug Discovery Institute, told DailyMail.com: 'Adipex-P, or phentermine, can significantly increase blood pressure and lead to dizziness and other symptoms described. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further, phentermine should not be combined with alcohol because it can mask its depressant effects and people can end up drinking too much.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Henderson claims he was not warned about these dangers during a consultation at a local weight loss clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he says he should have done his own research around the drugs before taking them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I take some of the blame because I should have known better,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To make matters worse, Mr Henderson was already suffering from high blood pressure but he claims this was also ignored during his consultation and he was able to get the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adipex-P - which are taken by mouth once daily, typically in the morning - were previously one of the go-to weight loss medications approved by the FDA before the advent of GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Wegovy and Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adipex-P is generally not recommended to patients with high blood pressure as it stimulates the central nervous system and can worsen cardiovascular conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are now warning patients to be vigilant as the demand for weight loss medications skyrocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medical bariatrics specialist Dr Jada Moore-Ruffin, who did not treat Mr Henderson, says she has seen people sourcing weight loss drugs online, from friends and 'from people who are not in the medical field'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She warns people: 'Don't just trust your body to anybody. Don't give yourself over to someone that can't really support you for the long game.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Haile notes that Adipex-P is a cheaper alternative to GLP-1 agonists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he also highlights that they work differently and have different potential side effects and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medic told this website: 'The GLP-1 agonists are all the rage in the US right now for weight loss and would seem to be a better alternative because they do not increase blood pressure however they are very expensive and probably not an option for the average person unfortunately.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following his unnerving experience with Adipex-P, Mr Henderson has now changed his approach to losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm doing it the natural way this time - you know, going to the gym, watching what I eat,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:57:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPbWxySU5SakdGSXJNaTY2YWQ1Wnl5WnU1NU9Lb010dGtmaTBsaHIwbjZ4OG9IQjNEN1p1aVJVM0ZycF9JZnl4U3Q4UFVibjFBR1Q4T3c2eTFsOXIwQXhnakZQd2xGazRYUVJWZHM3UGJPNEU3WHgwa0dfam1MQ2ZBc0dTVFNCVlpPRlhiRjBLUmlUN0VaejE2aEh0Mzh2QdIBowFBVV95cUxPLXVqenFlSlA1TC1GN2k4dE5HR25FazRSZzhUZEdpLWRKWGVrS3U1M1BmTm5kanQwUmFNQjFxd3RJUEZMNXlnNzg3cWs5ZU9fNkl5OG1HRlNVWkFBX3lHVUxkaHRTU00xVUk0am9MRjZrRVYyTDFsR3JpX1U5UWx5akdqM1N5d2hMOVd1M1hBYUJSVlltVjRVOGFySk1iYUN4Nk5Z</guid></item><item><title>Higher Depression Risks for Night Owls - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTFByS3ExUkFSSlhBc2I0a2Y1UG8zd3hDb21JcEpRWWV1VTFSemt3NnFwZGJjY3dPTkVDTEFmOUJUSTJmQmtLaThIaDhwOEhJZlZCY1R3NEUxdlVuWVNYaUNibmlRaGpmOHZFc1VJeE45Q0w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study finds that staying up late, known as having an “evening chronotype,” is associated with a higher risk of depression. Researchers analyzed data from 546 university students and found that this link is influenced by sleep quality, alcohol consumption, and mindfulness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evening chronotypes had poorer sleep, consumed more alcohol, and exhibited lower mindfulness compared to morning chronotypes. The study suggests that these factors may contribute to mental health risks in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Quality Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Evening chronotypes reported poorer sleep, affecting mental health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness Connection:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower mindfulness levels were linked to higher depression risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Late sleepers consumed more alcohol, further increasing depression risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness, total sleep quality, and alcohol consumption may help explain why people who stay up late have a greater risk of depression, according to a new study publishing March 19, 2025, in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; by Simon Evans of University of Surrey, UK, and colleagues.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that night owls who stay up late, called “evening chronotypes,” have more depression symptoms than people who are early risers, or “morning chronotypes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108185"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two people awake at night on their phones." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/night-owl-depression-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;With those caveats in mind, the authors conclude that interventions aimed at mindfulness, sleep and alcohol use might have the potential to reduce depression risk, amongst young adults in particular. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Evans and colleagues collected data from 546 university students using an online questionnaire. The data included self-reported information on the students’ sleep patterns, mindfulness, rumination tendencies, alcohol use, and depression and anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirmed that people with an evening chronotype were at a notably higher risk for depression and that the association could be explained by differences in mindfulness, sleep quality, and alcohol consumption. On average, evening chronotypes had poorer sleep quality, higher alcohol consumption, and acted with less mindfulness than morning chronotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was limited in its ability to prove cause-and-effect because of its cross-sectional design which relied on data at only one time point. In addition, the findings may not apply to age groups outside of the university students included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With those caveats in mind, the authors conclude that interventions aimed at mindfulness, sleep and alcohol use might have the potential to reduce depression risk, amongst young adults in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add: “With many young adults’ experiencing poor mental health, these study findings are particularly important—many young adults tend to stay up late and the results point to how interventions could be implemented to reduce their risk of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b9d6d7dcc9cbdccacaf9c9d5d6ca97d6cbde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hanna Abdallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hanna Abdallah – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319915" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mindfulness mediates the association between chronotype and depressive symptoms in young adults&lt;/a&gt;” by Yatagan Sevim G et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness mediates the association between chronotype and depressive symptoms in young adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronotype influences risk of depression, with evening-types at higher risk, although the reasons for this are uncertain. Potential mediating factors include mindfulness, sleep quality, rumination, and alcohol consumption, but research is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explored the role of these factors in the association between chronotype and depressive symptoms amongst young adults, using cross-sectional data collected from a university student sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; =  546).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evening-types had significantly higher levels of depression symptoms, poorer sleep quality, and lower levels of ‘acting with awareness’ and ‘describing’, as well as higher rumination and alcohol consumption. Mediation analyses demonstrated that the link between chronotype and depression was fully mediated by ‘acting with awareness’, ‘describing’, sleep quality, and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only subjective measures were employed, and due to the cross-sectional design, no causal inferences can be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mediation results shed light on the crucial role of specific mindfulness facets, sleep, and alcohol consumption for explaining why evening types are at higher risk of depression; findings have import for potential interventions aiming to reduce depression risk amongst young adults in particular.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:19:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFByS3ExUkFSSlhBc2I0a2Y1UG8zd3hDb21JcEpRWWV1VTFSemt3NnFwZGJjY3dPTkVDTEFmOUJUSTJmQmtLaThIaDhwOEhJZlZCY1R3NEUxdlVuWVNYaUNibmlRaGpmOHZFc1VJeE45Q0w</guid></item><item><title>Adult ADHD prescriptions still on the rise, especially among women over 35 - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxPdWszb1o5QmE3bEZHUHVsQ0lPVUs2eVZ3X2YxTzY1UHl0NlllTGVHVjNmNHZkdTFzeFd6T2FMU0Z1Y2RSLUd6U1hseXlGVnluWFdzMktXUDFNc3k3YjdKS1BodnZTdVJfTUE0WktybW1GZ2g4dmpRdldVd0hwRzFuQzBnNVJIYTE2RmNNT2x5VFQ1Y19lQzVfalhmZVlDUTJhQnZrWklIaWJIck1Yc1HSAVZBVV95cUxNaDhEUmhBX09FQXpvR1otYS13amlBMFg2T3N3TXM1elhOZTdNS3pLTl9RelI1M1RtdHNRVFVSRWlQNlBZWDNONjdkSUVsS242SERtNFRkdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Prescriptions for ADHD medications have been spiking in recent years, with the sharpest increase among middle-aged and older women.

At the end of 2022, 1.7 million women in this age group were prescribed stimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin for ADHD, compared to 1.2 million prescriptions in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s been an overall jump in ADHD prescriptions since the pandemic and the rise of telehealth. The new analysis, published in JAMA Psychiatry by researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also looked into how the medications are being misused — that is, taking more of the drugs than prescribed, taking them at times that differed from what the doctor ordered or using medication from someone else’s prescription&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers used data from more than 83,000 adults, ages 18 to 64 who participated in the 2021-2022 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Information on prescriptions came from the 2019-2022 IQVIA Total Patient Tracker and National Prescription Audit New to Brand databases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They found that the prevalence of misuse of prescription stimulants among women aged 35 to 64 was significantly lower than it was among men of the same age (13.7% versus 22.0%). Middle-aged women also misused their medications less than younger women (13.7% versus 36.8%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Three types of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/prescriptions-adhd-drugs-spiked-pandemic-cdc-report-finds-rcna77430" target="_blank"&gt;stimulants are approved for ADHD&lt;/a&gt;: amphetamine (Dexedrine, Adderall); methamphetamine (Desoxyn); and methylphenidate (Ritalin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, just over a quarter of people with prescriptions for ADHD medications reported misusing them. About 9% had what is called &lt;a href="https://library.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/pep20-06-01-001.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;prescription stimulant use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, or addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People taking an amphetamine or methamphetamine were more likely to misuse than those taking a methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers aren’t sure why there was such a big increase in older adult women being prescribed stimulants for ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It is a very large increase that I can’t fully explain,” said a study co-author, Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director at the National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The size of the increase in middle-aged women is surprising, said Aaron Brinen, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Girls with the neurodevelopmental disorder may not be diagnosed because their symptoms are often more subtle than those exhibited by boys, who are more likely to show symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsiveness, research indicates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I wonder if it speaks to women feeling more empowered to talk about what they are needing and about their struggles in life,” Brinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They may realize that they had ADHD as children but were never diagnosed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Girls are more likely to be overlooked because the way they express ADHD isn’t likely to be captured by teachers,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Brinen has female friends who weren’t diagnosed and treated until they were in their 50s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was the first time in their lives that they felt functional,” he said. “It’s a tragedy that it took so long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Untreated ADHD can lead to feelings of failure and depression, Brinen said. “People think of them as not trying, but they are constantly trying and meeting disappointment,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Brinen suspects women with ADHD are less likely to misuse the stimulants because their prescriptions make life easier. They don’t get high from the stimulants, they just feel more normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Women with ADHD sometimes manage to get by until they hit a stage where life becomes more difficult and challenging, said Mariely Hernandez, a clinical psychologist who specializes in addiction and ADHD and is a postdoctoral research fellow in the department of psychiatry at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The symptoms of ADHD might become a much bigger problem when women have children, Hernandez said. “The executive function needed to manage a family may exceed their cognitive resources, especially when the children are young,” she added. “Then their symptoms become too impairing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hormonal status can also affect the severity of symptoms, Hernandez said. “We see a lot of women diagnosed at menopause,” she said, adding that low estrogen levels in a woman with ADHD can lead to a dopamine deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Dopamine underlies our reward system,” she explained. “If you don’t make enough or aren’t able to properly utilize it, you won’t be able to focus as well. Women will say, ‘I can’t live like this. I want to be evaluated.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:27:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPdWszb1o5QmE3bEZHUHVsQ0lPVUs2eVZ3X2YxTzY1UHl0NlllTGVHVjNmNHZkdTFzeFd6T2FMU0Z1Y2RSLUd6U1hseXlGVnluWFdzMktXUDFNc3k3YjdKS1BodnZTdVJfTUE0WktybW1GZ2g4dmpRdldVd0hwRzFuQzBnNVJIYTE2RmNNT2x5VFQ1Y19lQzVfalhmZVlDUTJhQnZrWklIaWJIck1Yc1HSAVZBVV95cUxNaDhEUmhBX09FQXpvR1otYS13amlBMFg2T3N3TXM1elhOZTdNS3pLTl9RelI1M1RtdHNRVFVSRWlQNlBZWDNONjdkSUVsS242SERtNFRkdw</guid></item><item><title>10 Common Foods With Microplastics and Ways to Reduce Exposure - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPbVk1MGRrVVd4MUw4aVVOamEzanlVVVIwTzJ4RnVvbEhURUtZbHZCWURiZDRjTlpwaWZhbkV4am14QmZkR281NHR1YmVka1k4cDROQ2NIT2wxS1c5ektMTmlfRmgtUkM1ekpIUVZZNmlFMEhNbUFCSVRCY1JGYm1MTTVsZXdYYmlrcXJ4WTdkci1kS19qQVlmYWRobjZVenBkM0VV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Some researchers have estimated that people consume between &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184127/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;39,000 and 52,000 microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; each year. If we add how much we take in when breathing, that number goes up to 74,000 to 121,000. Recently, a new study &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a plastic spoon's worth of tiny plastic shards in human brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Microplastics are everywhere. They're in our water, our clothes and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/microplastics-in-your-kitchen/" target="_self"&gt;our kitchens&lt;/a&gt;. Experts have also found them in the foods we eat. OK, that sounds bad, but &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;bad is it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no officially established 'safe' or 'unsafe' level of microplastic intake. It makes sense to want your exposure to be as low as possible," Dr. Joseph &lt;a href="https://www.mercola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Mercola&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified family medicine osteopathic physician, said in an email.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics can enter our food due to contamination where the food was grown, raised or processed. Mercola explained that using plastic mulch and plastic seed coatings in agriculture, and irrigation with contaminated water, are among the various ways microplastics can end up in food. Plastic packaging, utensils and containers are additional sources.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the US Food and Drug Administration, current &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/microplastics-and-nanoplastics-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;evidence doesn't suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the levels of microplastics in food are a risk to us. However, you still might want to minimize how much microplastics you passively consume. These are the most common foods that contain microplastics, and the measures you can adopt to reduce your plastic intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Top 10 foods in your diet that contain microplastics &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Seafood &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant ways plastic particles end up in our food is through single-use plastics that break down and find their way into waterways and soil. When they reach the oceans, they end up in our seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microplastics are then taken up by plankton and mistaken for food by fish and selfish," Mercola said. "The tiny particles accumulate in the flesh ... then end up on our plates." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published by Portland State University discovered a variety of microplastics in &lt;a href="https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/researchers-detect-microplastics-in-the-muscle-tissues-of-oregon-seafood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;180 out of 182 tested seafood&lt;/a&gt; samples. Microfibers are the most common type of microplastic present, but this isn't the only type that ends up in our oceans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Tea bags &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plastic called polypropylene is often used to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10389239/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;make tea bags&lt;/a&gt;, and even if you choose paper tea bags, there can still be microplastics in them. The issue is that when the bags contact hot water, microplastics may be released into your tea.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona discovered that polypropylene tea bags can release plastic &lt;a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/-1345830290613.html?detid=1345940427095" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;particles in the billions&lt;/a&gt; and nylon and cellulose tea bags can release them in the millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it: &lt;/strong&gt;You don't have to stop drinking tea. Switch to loose-leaf tea and invest in a &lt;span class="c-shortcodeCommerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Infusers-Upgraded-Strainers-Flavoring-Seasonings/dp/B0DHVFKHW6?th=1&amp;amp;tag=cnet-buy-button-20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-aps-asin="B0DHVFKHW6" data-aps-asc-tag="cnet-buy-button-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="__COM_CLICK_ID__|-|dtp|cn" data-location="BODY"&gt;stainless steel diffuser&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to enjoy your tea free of microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Rice &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice is also a hot spot for microplastics. A University of Queensland study found that for every half cup of rice, there are &lt;a href="https://stories.uq.edu.au/news/2021/instant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punchinstant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punch/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;3 to 4 milligrams of plastic&lt;/a&gt;. If you use instant rice packets, that number is four times higher, at 13 milligrams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it: &lt;/strong&gt;The study found that &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/why-you-should-think-twice-about-eating-leftover-rice/" target="_self"&gt;washing your rice&lt;/a&gt; can reduce plastic contamination by 20% to 40%, though it's worth noting that the study used filtered water for rinsing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Salt and sugar &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you top off your dinner with a sprinkling of salt, you're getting an unintentional side of microplastics. It's hard to outrun salt. It's in almost everything we eat, and our bodies need a certain amount of sodium to keep our fluids and electrolytes balanced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, one study found that &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b04180" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;90% of the 39 sampled salt brands&lt;/a&gt; worldwide contained microplastics. This likely results from environmental contamination and the production and packaging process, which includes plastic. Microplastics have also been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157523001357" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;found in sugar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it: &lt;/strong&gt;To cut down on exposure to microplastics in your salt and sugar, you can buy them packaged in glass or cardboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yuliia Kokosha/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Bottled water &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottled water is one of the most well-known sources of micro and nanoplastics. One study estimated that there are about &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300582121" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;240,000 plastic particulates&lt;/a&gt; in a liter of bottled water. Most plastic water bottles you buy at the store are made from polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, plastic, so it wasn't surprising to see it represented. Plastic particles break apart when bottles are squeezed or exposed to heat. And PET plastic isn't the only type of nanoplastic researchers &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/bottled-water-can-contain-hundreds-thousands-nanoplastics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; in plastic water bottles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking tap water from a stainless steel or glass container can reduce your risk of ingesting plastic particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Honey &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not expect your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/is-honey-actually-good-for-you-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_self"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; to harbor microplastics, but it does, even if it's in a glass jar. Microplastic fibers can be traced back to bees and pollution. One study exploring whether microplastics ingested or carried by honeybees were then incorporated into hives found that bees can continue the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749123000805?__cf_chl_tk=MSXhDg.kFtGbZ0xj.BqEf_1RKejtd_VJPcTtz_7IQmw-1740000824-1.0.1.1-zSGcmly1meJNCQ1shRWNbSkegK_60v3.YZLjpZlvflc" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;dispersal of microplastics&lt;/a&gt; through honey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it:&lt;/strong&gt; Buying honey from local beekeepers who often use more-natural and sustainable harvesting methods may reduce the risk of microplastic contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Fruits and veggies &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetables and fruits are an essential part of a balanced diet. Unfortunately, they can also contain microplastics. One study that sampled &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/put-in-extra-effort-to-wash-these-12-pesticide-prone-fruits-and-vegetables/" target="_self"&gt;fruit and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305703" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;apples were the most&lt;/a&gt; contaminated fruit and carrots were the most contaminated vegetable. How does this happen? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plants have been shown to uptake micro- and nanoplastics from soil through their root systems, thereby contaminating the edible portions," Mercola said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many grocery stores also package fruit and vegetables in plastic to keep them fresh. According to the FDA, there isn't &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/microplastics-and-nanoplastics-foods#:~:text=Health%20Effects%20Information&amp;amp;text=While%20some%20studies%20suggest%20there,a%20risk%20to%20human%20health." target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;enough evidence&lt;/a&gt; to determine that microplastics from plastic food packaging migrate into food. But Mercola suggests you avoid it as much as you can anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it:&lt;/strong&gt; Wash your fruit thoroughly, peel when possible, and opt for local or organic produce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Animaflora/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Proteins &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study from researchers at the Ocean Conservancy found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;88% of vegetable and animal proteins&lt;/a&gt; contain some level of microplastics. But highly processed proteins, like plant-based alternatives, fish sticks or chicken nuggets, harbor the most microplastics, suggesting the microplastic contamination partly comes from &lt;a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/news/its-not-just-seafood-new-study-finds-microplastics-in-nearly-90-of-proteins-sampled-including-plant-based-meat-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;food processing&lt;/a&gt;. The study found that breaded shrimp had an average of 300 microplastic pieces per serving. Plant-based nuggets had 100 pieces per serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food processing isn't the only way microplastics can get into these protein sources. Microplastics are in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666154324002953" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;animal feeds&lt;/a&gt; and in the environments where animals are raised. Plant-based alternatives can be contaminated through the soil or irrigation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it:&lt;/strong&gt; After reading that, you may be wondering what protein you should eat. The reality is that more research is needed to know the exact levels and their impact on our health. Our bodies need protein to function, so getting enough is important, no matter which source you choose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/an-easy-protein-visual-guide-to-help-you-reach-maximum-muscle-gains/" target="_self"&gt;An Easy Protein Visual Guide to Help You Reach Maximum Muscle Gains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What do microplastics in food mean for you? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, do all foods contain microplastics? I can't say for sure. I can tell you, however, that more research is needed to understand just how eating foods with microplastics affects us. Still, though the long-term health effects remain under investigation, microplastics are something to watch out for and guard against if you can, as Mercola explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ingested microplastics have been found to accumulate in the circulatory system and various organs, including the brain, where they can cause inflammation and tissue damage," said Mercola. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential side effects are hormonal imbalances caused by the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151227/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;endocrine-disrupting chemicals&lt;/a&gt; found in plastics. Microplastics can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749123021929" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;absorb other&lt;/a&gt; environmental toxins and introduce them into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no established safe level of microplastics, and we can't completely outrun them: They're everywhere and in everything. But it's a good idea to minimize exposure where you can. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Expert tips for reducing your intake of microplastics &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can cut down by following this advice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be careful how much shellfish you eat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Shellfish like mussels, oysters and scallops have higher levels of microplastics, so don't overdo it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid food-storage containers made of plastic&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This is one of Mercola's biggest suggestions, because of the "plasticizing chemicals" in the plastic. BPA and phthalates are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can transfer from plastic to food. They're fat-soluble, so it happens most easily with fatty foods. It's best to store foods with fat in glass containers. You can store dry foods in plastic if you need to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid plastic-wrapped foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This can be easier said than done, but it's something to strive for in areas where you can make the switch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get rid of plastic kitchen utensils&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;From the spoons we use to stir our sauces to the cutting boards we use to chop our vegetables, if they're plastic, you're ingesting microplastics. A good rule of thumb is: Anything plastic that comes in contact with your food should be swapped out for ceramic, glass, stainless steel or wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help address the overall issue of microplastics in food, you can install a filter in your clothes-washing machine. If you can afford it, a special filter will catch microfibers before they pollute water systems.

Just consume it more often throughout your day,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zumpano-julia-4757482a"&gt;Julia Zumpano&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P2RCLOVBY5ELJD2GCJ4ROAFQTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168462/nutrients"&gt;Spinach&lt;/a&gt; is chock full of vitamins, minerals and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-nutritional-science/article/flavonoids-an-overview/C0E91D3851345CEF4746B10406908F52"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the superfood is a solid source of fiber, which may keep people satisfied longer, and in turn, make between-meal cravings less likely, said &lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/dana-hunnes"&gt;Dana Ellis Hunnes&lt;/a&gt;, a senior clinical dietitian for UCLA Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7VVHPVOSBB6VI4AO5LATNHOZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7551485/"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/03/eat-vegetables-first-food-sequencing/"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, in which vegetables and proteins are eaten before carbohydrates, can reduce spikes in blood sugar. (Blood sugar spikes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5912158/" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to cravings&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for carbohydrates and sugar, experts said.) A recent review of 11 studies &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/27697061.2022.2161664"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that people who consumed carbohydrates at the end of a meal had lower blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRJ5QIVQJVEO7LBLK7GDLRZ6PI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No matter how spinach is eaten, however, it has not been shown to retrain taste buds, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUVTGOQUE5E57HXP6EB4OATHUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In any case, the social media trend is encouraging people to eat more spinach, which is “awesome,” Zumpano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HDNCNFNFBJETLAANDYHXR5FHOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are some risks, while rare, associated with eating too much spinach, though there is no consensus on how much is too much. A serving size is 2 cups of raw spinach or 1 cup of cooked spinach, &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/vegetables" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUFLHHBI6BDSBL5BNZ3JEJGM24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Spinach is rich in &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminK-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, which may interact negatively with some prescription blood thinners. Also, spinach can be high in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/17/3201"&gt;oxalates&lt;/a&gt;, compounds that bind to minerals such as calcium and can exacerbate kidney stones in people who are prone to them, said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/theresa-gentile"&gt;Theresa Gentile&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Cooking vegetables can significantly reduce the oxalate content, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15826055/"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NHGWZI2FAVCKXPNYDRKFWMZKUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As for the nutritional value, Gentile said that while raw spinach has more lutein and vitamin C, cooked spinach better brings out the bioavailability of other vitamins such as vitamin A, beta carotene, thiamin, riboflavin, magnesium and calcium. But there are many factors that affect nutrient content, such as the soil condition, length of storage, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1081/JFP-200033079"&gt;cooking method&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36299246/"&gt;cooking time&lt;/a&gt;, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CWRKNFOCIZB4HGLX2IPOJAY2ME" data-apitype="header" level="3" id="CWRKNFOCIZB4HGLX2IPOJAY2ME"&gt;What else you should know:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IUT5JVB4W5CYFFODY3EKCMFTUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you do not enjoy&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;spinach, there is no reason to choke it down, experts said. You could try baby spinach, which is milder and sweeter, Gentile said.

Once reintroduced back into the body, the T cells replicate, creating a surge of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/melanoma-new-immunotherapy-cancer-treatment-rcna60468" target="_blank"&gt;cancer-fighting immune cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg" alt="The Nielsen family."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Gavin with his parents and younger sister, Aurora.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Jovelle Tamayo for NBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The results of Vitanza’s early-stage &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03451-3" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; were published in Nature Medicine in January. In addition to Gavin, 20 children and young adults with DIPG got CAR-T therapy every two to four weeks. The median survival was about 20 months — nearly double the expected prognosis. Three patients, however, are still alive 3 ½ to 4 ½ years after starting their treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gavin is one of those patients. Now 6 years old, he’s lived four times longer than doctors initially predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s the biggest miracle that I could ever ask for, just to have time,” Ashlee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gavin is still getting CAR-T infusions every two to three weeks. Sometimes, for about 12 hours after the infusions, he has headaches, nausea and vomiting. Other times, he’s ready to run around on the soccer field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Mark Souweidane, director of pediatric neurosurgery at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, who wasn’t involved with the trial, said the results were encouraging, but added that it’s not “out of the realm of the norm” to have some patients survive longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are going to be outliers. You will get 5%-10% of kids who live beyond two years,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:33:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNdGk5TjZGNVpKMUFHdFEyYWZNVWI5TVE0dWl5em5wSURjelVzZWw4UkJHS2NVUG5KZ2FIRGV0WmN6Z0lZeUplTG5VYU5SNF85Y292SUhXa0hhVUd4enEtejhmYXZsVDRuN3ZyM3BVczh5YlhRMDZJdnloM2dzZ1U4VUFzVzk3b0E1a0tuV1dDWjJNS1ZZc01xVkswZDNid19CMGxIVXN4QjM3UjA1U2JRajdRS3JvbTFCb05R0gFWQVVfeXFMUGdTck5DcmhtZ2tFbDZwU18tUTRxT3pSdldMbmtGcVN5enBHZ3NEU0NpQWdFbGc3RUNheUtQRVpYbFpQdU1Od2F6NkFQOE93ZXIyUHdtdGc</guid></item><item><title>A 26-year-old woman's shocking stage 4 colon cancer diagnosis after excruciating stomach pain was mistake - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered a disease of the elderly, colon cancer is increasingly affecting younger generations, with early-onset cases rising at an alarming rate. Many are aggressive or diagnosed at a later stage, leading to a poor prognosis. A 26-year-old woman's excruciating pain in her stomach was dismissed as celiac disease. By the time her scheduled scan came through, her symptoms had intensified and she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, Business Insider reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Colon cancer in young&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer cases in young people have witnessed a sharp rise in recent years even as the overall rate of the deadly cancer is on the decline. Over the years, the average age of early-onset colorectal cancer has decreased. A decade ago, it was in the 40s, but now it has dropped further to the 30s and 40s. In the case of younger colon cancer patients, an inherited genetic mutation could be behind the malignancy. However, lifestyle factors like eating an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle may also contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The young lady's painful predicament&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannin Desroches, 26, was full of life and leading an active lifestyle, eating healthy and clean diet. When she started experiencing stomach pain after meals, she was initially told by her doctor in Ontario that it was likely a gluten allergy, and asked her to get blood work done, a Business Insider report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she booked her own CT scan. However, due to a long waiting time, it took almost a year to schedule a scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she ate smaller snacks to avoid abdominal discomfort, she experienced symptoms like constipation, pencil-thin stools, and felt a nagging pain in her left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter what I ate, I was in excruciating pain, pretty much yelling for help," Desroches, told Business Insider. She feared that she with these symptoms, she wouldn't be able to make it to the scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was eventually admitted for an emergency colonoscopy in early 2024, however, by that time the tumour in her colon got so big that the procedure couldn't be finished. She told the outlet that The GI specialist "couldn't get the camera through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, she was given a three-year life expectancy. She now wishes colonoscopies were more routine for people under 45, the recommended minimum age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I had a colonoscopy done, I could have caught this even in stage 2 or 3," she said. "That's the most frustrating part to me, knowing that I shouldn't have to be here fighting stage 4."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Another nightmare unfolds&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches was able to book an MRI in April 2024 with the help of a friend. A blockage was found and a colonoscopy the next morning confirmed it was a tumour. She subsequently underwent a six-hour surgery, which removed part of her large intestine where the tumour was located, her right ovary, 13 lymph nodes, and part of the membrane lining her liver. The large tumors on the liver could not be removed for the fear of liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning after she woke up with her husband at her side, the surgeon told her she had stage 4 cancer and advise her to start egg retrieval from her left ovary right away, if she wanted children as the cancer may spread quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remember just almost disassociating," Desroches said. She and her husband broke down once the doctor left. "We just had a good cry together and just bawled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches opted for immunotherapy, a targeted treatment designed to help her immune system fight cancer, in combination with two chemotherapy drugs. However, chemotherapy took a troubling turn. During her 13th round of oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug, she suffered an anaphylactic shock, forcing her to stop the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was probably the scariest feeling I've ever felt, knowing that my body is literally shutting down on me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results have been far from encouraging as in the CT scan in January her tumours didn't shrink. The next one is scheduled for April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Desroches is exploring other options. The hepatic arterial infusion pump she needs is only available in Canada through a clinical trial she doesn't qualify for. While the procedure is more common in the US, her oncologist estimates it could cost over $500,000, making it financially out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has started a GoFundMe page for her cancer treatments and looking for options in Europe. "It's very overwhelming, but when you're in fight-or-flight mode for your life, it doesn't matter," she said. "You just do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Desroches and family are trying to stay positive. In October, she married her husband, Cody Desroches, at a beachside wedding in Jamaica. "I would do anything to go back to that day," she said. They're also planning to have kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after surgery, Desroches met with a fertility doctor to start the egg-freezing process right away. "It was the worst pain I've ever experienced," she said, describing intense nausea from hormone injections and dry-heaving so violently she feared her surgical staples would tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following her procedures, she knows she’ll never be able to carry a child but hopes she and her husband can one day have one through surrogacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, picturing a future is still hard for her. "It's just natural when you're at this age — you're always thinking about what's next, whether it's planning a trip, renovating her house, or having kids." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She still tries to cherish every moment with her loved ones, even though her life currently is in contrast with that of a busy nurse prior to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I try not to focus on that three-year mark because that's just a statistic," she said. "That's not me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 15:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>How Sleep Deprivation Affects Your Brain and Overall Health - Indian Defence Review</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFA5cHphaGdTQXdTV29xSU9qYVBlYV9CcE9yN1BBWmVjSXN1YThZSEd3RE9KRHhhejJMWVFScmd3VjdLZDh5RHJWQzZYMndQMk1wTnRDNHNSNmZ4TDVnTE5FUlR6S2h5ZVZfOGQ2N2NXM0VQNDFSaE15ZVU0d0g1Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missing sleep might feel like a minor inconvenience, but its effects go far beyond tiredness, including sleep deprivation that can impact both physical and mental health. &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/researchers-reveal-what-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" data-type="link" data-id="https://scitechdaily.com/researchers-reveal-what-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SciTechDaily&lt;/a&gt; reports that ongoing research links sleep deprivation to memory impairment, cognitive decline, and long-term health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; Sleep plays a crucial role in removing brain toxins, regulating hormones, and maintaining immune function. Yet, many people trade sleep for work, entertainment, or social habits, unaware of its deeper consequences. The full impact of sleep deprivation is more alarming than most realize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetfulness, Slow Thinking, and Poor Decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When sleep-deprived, the brain struggles to store memories, process emotions, and make rational decisions. Research has shown that individuals who don’t get enough sleep experience impaired memory retention, making it harder to recall information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function slows down, affecting problem-solving and learning capabilities. Additionally, emotional instability increases, leading to higher levels of stress, irritability, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study from The University of Hong Kong (HKU), led by &lt;a href="https://neurotlee.hku.hk/people/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://cbh.hku.hk/people-tatia#:~:text=Prof.,American%20Board%20of%20Professional%20Neuropsychology." rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Tatia M.C. Lee&lt;/a&gt;, found that poor sleep directly impacts the glymphatic system—the brain’s waste removal network. This system plays a crucial role in clearing out toxins and harmful proteins that accumulate throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep quality, brain activities, and glymphatic functioning are related. Understanding how sleep quality influences the glymphatic system and human brain networks offers valuable insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning age-related memory change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Explains &lt;strong&gt;Professor Lee&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; When sleep is disrupted, this process is hindered, leading to an increased risk of neurological diseases. Professor Lee explains that sleep quality, brain activity, and glymphatic functioning are closely linked, and understanding these interactions can provide valuable insights into age-related memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HKU study observed older adults using functional MRI scans and found that poor sleep deactivates the glymphatic system, resulting in memory impairment and cognitive decline. According to Professor Lee, this discovery highlights the necessity of maintaining efficient glymphatic functioning to promote healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results clearly reveal the effect of sleep on the human brain’s network through the glymphatic system, which in turn affects memory performance in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lee adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Without proper sleep, the brain becomes overwhelmed with waste, making individuals more vulnerable to Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impaired memory is a common complaint among older adults with poor sleep quality – Lee notes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our results provide a novel perspective on the interplay between sleep, the glymphatic system, and multimodal brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constant Fatigue and Low Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you wake up feeling exhausted despite spending hours in bed, it is a clear sign that your sleep is not restorative. &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/bill-gates-admits-i-thought-i-was-one-mistake-away-from-death-with-microsoft-until-the-late-90s/" data-type="post" data-id="73393"&gt;Chronic sleep&lt;/a&gt; deprivation results in persistent daytime drowsiness, making even the simplest tasks feel draining. Physical energy diminishes, reducing motivation for exercise and overall productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2021 study revealed that sleep deprivation significantly affects balance and coordination, increasing the likelihood of falls and injuries. The brain requires sufficient rest to maintain motor function, and without it, movements become clumsy and reaction times slow down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Chronic sleep deprivation disrupts the brain’s ability to regulate emotions, leading to mood swings, irritability, and heightened stress levels. It also increases the risk of developing anxiety and depression. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that &lt;strong&gt;80%&lt;/strong&gt; of people with depression suffer from sleep disturbances, and individuals with insomnia are twice as likely to develop clinical depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakened Immune System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lack of sleep weakens the immune system by reducing cytokine production, the proteins responsible for fighting infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; As a result, sleep-deprived individuals fall sick more frequently and take longer to recover from illnesses. Chronic inflammation also increases the risk of long-term diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation negatively affects the body’s hormonal balance, particularly those responsible for regulating hunger and metabolism. Levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates hunger, increase, while levels of leptin, which signals fullness, decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; This imbalance leads to uncontrollable cravings for unhealthy foods, particularly sweets and carbohydrates, which contribute to weight gain. Additionally, higher cortisol levels, caused by stress from sleep deprivation, further promote fat storage, particularly in the abdominal area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart Disease and High Blood Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep is directly linked to cardiovascular diseases. Studies show that individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours per night have a higher likelihood of developing high blood pressure (hypertension), irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), and coronary artery disease. The long-term effects of sleep deprivation increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Driving while sleep-deprived is just as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that drowsy driving is responsible for thousands of car crashes, injuries, and deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After 20 hours without sleep, cognitive function declines to the equivalent of having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08%, which is the legal intoxication limit in most U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Ways to Fix Your Sleep Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is crucial for long-term health. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day—even on weekends—helps regulate the body’s internal clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reducing screen time at least an hour before bed is essential, as the blue light from devices suppresses melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol in the evening also improves sleep quality, as both substances can interfere with the sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creating an environment conducive to sleep is equally important. Keeping the bedroom cool, dark, and quiet enhances sleep quality. Regular physical activity during the day can also contribute to deeper and more restorative sleep, but it’s best to avoid exercising too close to bedtime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Lastly, long daytime naps—especially those exceeding 20 minutes—should be avoided, as they can disrupt natural sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If lifestyle adjustments fail to improve sleep quality, consulting a sleep specialist may be necessary to rule out underlying sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

A new review highlights how unpredictable sensory experiences, beyond traditional stressors like abuse and neglect, can disrupt brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers explore key questions, including what stress means for a developing brain and how it shapes neural circuits long-term. Studies suggest that early stress alters gene expression and brain connectivity, influencing lifelong mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional scoring systems for childhood adversity may not fully capture individual risk, as emerging factors like inequality and pollution also contribute. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to new interventions to mitigate long-term effects of early-life stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpredictability Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Inconsistent sensory experiences in early life can disrupt brain development, even without severe trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular Reprogramming:&lt;/strong&gt; Early-life stress alters gene expression and neural circuits, affecting mental health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Traditional Models:&lt;/strong&gt; Factors like social inequality and pollution may also contribute to childhood adversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early-life adversity affects more than half of the world’s children and is a significant risk factor for cognitive and mental health problems later in life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an extensive and up-to-the-minute review of research in this domain, scholars from the University of California, Irvine illuminate the profound impacts of these adverse childhood experiences on brain development and introduce new paths for understanding and tackling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108181"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; Emerging factors, such as societal and anthropogenic characteristics like inequality and pollution, are gaining recognition as potential contributors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study, published in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, examines the mechanisms behind the long-term consequences of childhood stress (adversity). Despite extensive research spanning over seven decades, the authors point out that significant questions remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, how do adults – from parents to researchers – fully comprehend what is perceived as stressful by an infant or child?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such conceptual queries, as well as the use of cutting-edge research tools, can provide a road map, guiding experts toward developing innovative methods and providing solutions to this pressing mental health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that the unpredictability of a child’s early environment may be just as important as more traditionally recognized forms of adversity, such as abuse or neglect,” said lead author Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, Donald Bren Professor of Pediatrics and one of the world’s leading researchers in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our review has important implications for how we approach early intervention and prevention strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and co-author Matthew Birnie, a UC Irvine postdoctoral scholar, identify several key areas for further investigation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does the developing brain perceive as stressful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which aspects of stress most significantly influence brain maturation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which developmental ages are most vulnerable to adversity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the molecular mediators of stress effects on the brain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can transient stressful experiences lead to enduring dysfunction?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notable discovery is a novel form of early-life stress: unpredictable sensory inputs from caregivers and the environment. This factor plays a substantial role in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, even after controlling for well-known adverse childhood experiences, which are collectively referred to as ACEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review highlights the limitations of current ACE scoring systems in accurately predicting individual outcomes and underscores the complexity of early-life stress. Emerging factors, such as societal and anthropogenic characteristics like inequality and pollution, are gaining recognition as potential contributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal models have been instrumental in unraveling the mechanisms underlying brain development effects. Research has revealed that different types of stress can yield distinct outcomes, influenced by the nature and timing of stress, as well as species, strain and sex variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, early-life stress can substantially alter neuronal gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. These changes may lead to long-term modifications in how the brain responds to subsequent experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the circuit level, early stress can disrupt the maturation of brain networks by interfering with crucial developmental processes, including neuronal oscillations and synaptic pruning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re gradually comprehending how early-life stress can ‘reprogram’ the brain at multiple levels, from individual molecules to entire neural circuits. This knowledge presents new avenues for targeted interventions,” Baram said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review also identifies key molecular mediators of early-life stress effects, including glucocorticoids and neuropeptides like corticotropin-releasing hormones. Ongoing research is uncovering novel roles for these molecules in specific neural circuits affected by early stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of these findings, the researchers propose redefining early-life stress as “early-life adversity” to better encompass the diverse experiences that can impact brain development, even those not traditionally perceived as stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of early-life adversity,” Baram said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By focusing on how the developing brain processes and responds to these experiences, we can develop more effective strategies to prevent and mitigate their long-term effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest increased funding for and attention to this critical area of study, highlighting its potential to enhance mental health outcomes and reduce the societal burden of early-life adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baram is also the Danette Shepard Chair in Neurological Studies and director of UC Irvine’s Conte Center, which is supported by a Silvio O.

                The total human cases from bird flu is still low but if the virus mutates in certain ways, scientists fear pandemic. They're studying how immunity from seasonal flu might protect us.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Bird flu has ripped through the animal kingdom for the past few years now, killing countless birds and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08054-z" target="_blank"&gt;crossing into&lt;/a&gt; an alarming number of mammals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet people remain largely untouched.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the official tally&lt;/a&gt; of human cases in the U.S. is most certainly an undercount, there's still no evidence this strain of H5N1 has spread widely among us. But if the virus gains certain mutations, scientists fear it could trigger another pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This prospect has propelled research into whether our defenses built up from past flu seasons can offer any protection against H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So far, the findings offer some reassurance. Antibodies and other players in the immune system may buffer the worst consequences of bird flu, at least to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There's certainly preexisting immunity," says &lt;a href="http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/krammerlab/" target="_blank"&gt;Florian Krammer&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine who is involved in some of the new studies. "That's very likely not going to protect us as a population from a new pandemic, but it might give us some protection against severe disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This protection is based on shared traits between bird flu and types of seasonal flu that have circulated among us. Certain segments of the population, namely older people, may be particularly well-primed because of flu infections during early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are caveats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While this is a bit of a silver lining, it doesn't mean we should all feel safe," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/microbiology-immunology/research/labs/lakdawala/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seema Lakdawala&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Emory University's School of Medicine whose lab is probing this question.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For one thing, the studies can't be done on people. The conclusions are based on animal models and blood tests that measure the immune response. And how this holds up for an individual is expected to vary considerably, depending on their own immune history, underlying health conditions and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But for now, influenza researchers speculate this may be one reason most people who've caught bird flu over the past year have not fallen severely ill.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Earlier run-ins with flu can pay off&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During the last influenza pandemic — the 2009 swine flu outbreak — people under 65 &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70121-4/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;accounted for most&lt;/a&gt; of the hospitalizations and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was a surprising pattern for influenza, which generally strikes the elderly hardest. Scientists attribute it to the fact that people had dealt with a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1186430" target="_blank"&gt;similar version&lt;/a&gt; of flu that had circulated until about 1957.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They were still getting infected, but they had an advantage," say &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/labs/sette-lab/" target="_blank"&gt;Alessandro Sette&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. "This is very clear evidence that preexisting immunity against influenza can have a beneficial effect."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So could we hope for a similar phenomenon — this time with H5N1 bird flu?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03599-6" target="_blank"&gt;published this month&lt;/a&gt; is encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By analyzing blood samples from close to 160 people, a team at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago were able to show that people born roughly before 1965 had higher levels of antibodies — proteins that bind to parts of the virus — which cross-react to the current strain of bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's almost certain these people were never directly infected with that virus, meaning those antibodies can be traced to past seasonal flu infections.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They had a much clearer signal of an antibody response" than those born later, says &lt;a href="https://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/people/sarah-cobey/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Cobey&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago and senior author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What's driving that appears to be the viruses that people were infected with in childhood," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This is known as "immune imprinting" — when your immune system learns to respond to viruses that are the same or quite similar to the ones that first infected you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Between 1968 and about 1977, the flu strain going around was more distantly related to H5N1, so people born in those years didn't have the same antibody response. And the picture becomes mixed in the following years because multiple versions of flu were spreading.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Younger individuals, particularly children, could end up being the most susceptible in the event of a pandemic, although the existing bird flu vaccines could boost antibodies in that group significantly, Cobey and her colleagues concluded in their study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's still going to be a lot of individual variation in what this disease could look like," she says. "If I were in my late 60s, I would still not be confident that this is necessarily going to be a mild disease for me.&lt;em&gt;" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Flu immunity guards against the 'worst virus' seen in animals&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/H5N1-seroprevalence-studies.html" target="_blank"&gt;found little to no evidence&lt;/a&gt; of past infections with H5N1 bird flu when they analyzed blood samples from the general population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These tests focus on looking for antibody activity that would directly neutralize the bird flu virus. Other more fine-tuned measures, however, do turn up evidence that we are already familiar with and partly armed to fight this virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When battling an infection, the immune system makes antibodies that are targeted all over the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, Cobey's study measured antibodies that bind to a particular part of a protein that covers the surface of seasonal flu virus in humans and bird flu. Hemagglutinin, or the HA protein, latches onto the receptors of a cell so that it can gain entry and replicate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lakdawala says you can picture the HA as a "lollipop."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The heads can be very different, but those sticks, technically called "stalks," can sometimes be quite similar. That happens to be the case for bird flu and H1N1, which emerged as one of the predominant subtypes of seasonal flu after the 2009 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antibodies directed against the stalks of H1N1 viruses can cross-react with H5N1, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379120301725" target="_blank"&gt;likely indicating&lt;/a&gt; some protection against severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Help may also come from antibodies aimed at the other dominant protein on the surface of influenza viruses, called neuraminidase.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In her lab, Lakdawala has recently run experiments on ferrets (a common stand-in for humans when studying respiratory disease) that suggest antibodies against this N1 protein — gained from previous seasonal flu infections — can also reduce severe illness when the animals catch bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These animals all survived. They didn't get that sick. Importantly the virus remained restricted to the respiratory tract," says Lakdawala.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says this was a sharp contrast to previous studies where scientists took lab animals with no immunity to any kind of influenza and infected them with the current strain of bird flu. In that scenario, the infection went systemic, traveling into the bloodstream and brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People had described it as the worst virus they've ever put into an animal," she says. "So this offers a glimmer of hope."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1485_article" target="_blank"&gt;results appeared &lt;/a&gt;in the journal of &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases &lt;/em&gt;last month, alongside another ferret study &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1489_article" target="_blank"&gt;showing immunity&lt;/a&gt; from H1N1 could also limit the spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A third piece of the immunity puzzle — what could also explain Lakdawala's findings — are T cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unlike antibodies, these immune cells hunt down the virus once it has broken into a cell and started to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/t-cells-may-offer-some-protection-in-an-h5n1-spillover-scenario/" target="_blank"&gt;published last year&lt;/a&gt;, Sette and his team tested blood samples collected from volunteers to identify whether their T cells that target fragments of the flu virus could do the same for H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There was a nearly complete cross-recognition," says Sette.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The reason, he explains, is that proteins inside both of these influenza viruses are quite similar. Those fragments end up decorating the outside of the cell once it's infected, which is how T cells recognize it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is very hopeful, but we do not know how much cross-reactivity is necessary to impact disease severity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Many unknowns about how deadly a pandemic could be&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers caution you can only extrapolate so much about pre-existing immunity from these studies.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's probably one of many factors that could be at play in the current outbreak including: a person's underlying health, whether they were exposed to a big "dose" of the virus, and the route of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And whatever mutations the virus gains in the future could change the risk calculus altogether.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are already concerns a variant of the current strain, known as the D1.1 genotype, might be more lethal, partly because it's linked to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-02262025.html" target="_blank"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; of the severe cases and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/06/nx-s1-5250251/bird-flu-death-louisiana" target="_blank"&gt;the only death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. That variant had circulated widely in wild birds and gained attention recently after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5286265/bird-flu-cow-cattle-nevada" target="_blank"&gt;being detected&lt;/a&gt; in dairy cattle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lakdawala says her lab is still analyzing data on the D1.1 variant, but the initial results make her "hopeful" that their findings on pre-existing immunity apply here, as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, while there are reasons to believe at least some existing protection in the event of a pandemic or spillovers from livestock, scientists stress that bird flu is no joke. The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20250131.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;historical record&lt;/a&gt; of known H5N1 cases offers a harrowing case fatality rate of about 50% among humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's very likely an overestimate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Milder cases were probably missed over the years, as appears to be the case during this current outbreak, says Lakdawala. "Because if it were [that high now], we would be capturing so many more of the infections.&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Krammer points out even a much lower fatality rate would be devastating:  "You don't need a 50% case fatality rate to have a really bad pandemic, right? If you have 1 or 2%, that could also be very bad already."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Since being nominated as America’s new health czar, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said and done a lot of questionable stuff, the latest of which is to share his disturbing approach to the bird flu epidemic. RFK’s strategy for protecting the nation’s fowl population? Eh, just let the flu cull the herd and see if anything good comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html"&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy has been suggesting that to defeat bird flu, you first have to let it get its groove on. The Times quotes a recent Fox News interview, in which Kennedy told the news channel’s listeners that America “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it”—a notion Kennedy has offered multiple times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy is only responsible for human health, not bird health (the Department of Agriculture is the point agency for that). Still, it’s not necessarily super comforting that Kennedy’s first impulse when he hears about a communicable illness is to just sit back and let it do its thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas, told the Times that Kennedy’s plan was “a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” also calling it a “recipe for disaster.” Experts like Hansen seem to agree that giving the virus a free pass to spread would just allow it to mutate and grow more powerful. Indeed, other current and former federal officials and scientists that the newspaper spoke to all said that stepping back and letting bird flu ravage domestic chicken populations was really only a recipe for lost farm profits and more dead birds. Kennedy’s strategy (and the apparent worldview that informs it) also seems to hammer home the point that he is, on a fundamental level, unqualified to head the HHS. The Times writes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy “means longer quarantine, more downtime, more lost revenue and increased expenses,” said a U.S.D.A. scientist who was not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Kennedy has suggested that a subset of poultry might be naturally immune to bird flu. But chickens and turkeys lack the genes needed to resist the virus, experts said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The way we raise birds now, there’s not a lot of genetic variability,” Dr. Hansen said. “They’re all the same bird, basically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This seems like yet another good example of why—when it comes to finding someone to lead the nation’s most powerful scientific policy and research organization—nominating a guy who self-admittedly &lt;a href="https://blog.ucs.org/dminovi/robert-f-kennedy-is-unfit-to-lead-u-s-public-health-agencies/"&gt;isn’t a scientist&lt;/a&gt; and doesn’t know anything about science might have been a stupid idea. But hey, while it seems increasingly unlikely that Kennedy can protect us from easily preventable illnesses like measles, and while he’s demonstrated a willingness to cut funding to critically important health research (including &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/3/18/2311017/-RFK-Jr-s-anti-vax-stance-is-jeopardizing-cancer-treatments"&gt;cancer treatments)&lt;/a&gt;, and while he doesn’t seem particularly concerned that a nationwide chicken plague has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/egg-prices-wholesale.html#:~:text=An%20outbreak%20of%20bird%20flu,a%20dozen%20at%20their%20peak."&gt;driving up egg prices&lt;/a&gt;, at least he’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg"&gt;made America safe for tallow again&lt;/a&gt;, right? Yeah, tasty french fries are a good tradeoff for the breakdown of national health policy.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals that bowel movement frequency significantly influences physiology and long-term health, with the best outcomes linked with passing stools once or twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested associations between constipation and diarrhea with higher risks of infections and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since these findings were observed in sick patients, it remained unclear whether irregular bathroom visits were the cause or result of their conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the studied variables" class="size-medium wp-image-132891" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-461x415.jpg 461w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-600x540.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Participants provided samples of blood plasma and stool, in addition to filling out extensive diet, health, and lifestyle questionnaires.  (&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Johnson-Martínez et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do hope that this work will kind of open clinicians' minds a bit to the potential risks of not managing bowel movement frequencies," senior author Sean Gibbons at the Institute for Systems Biology told AFP, explaining that doctors often view irregular movements as merely a "nuisance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbons and his team collected clinical, lifestyle, and biological data – including blood chemistry, gut microbiome, genetics and more – from over 1,400 healthy adult volunteers with no signs of active disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants' self-reported bowel movement frequencies were categorized into four groups: constipation (one or two bowel movements per week), low-normal (three to six per week), high-normal (one to three per day), and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stools linger too long in the gut, microbes exhaust the available fiber – which they ferment into beneficial short-chain fatty acids – and instead ferment proteins, producing toxins like p-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we found is that even in healthy people who are constipated, there is a rise in these toxins in the bloodstream," said Gibbons, noting that these toxins are particularly burdensome to the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145266" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/fx1.jpg" alt="Graphic showing the study findings" class="wp-image-145266" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145266" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Toxins like p-cresol sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate (3-IS) in the bloodstream are particularly burdensome to the kidneys.

&lt;p&gt;Gibbons explained that during diarrhea, the body excretes excessive bile acid, which the liver would otherwise recycle to dissolve and absorb dietary fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144992" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144992" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642.jpg" alt="Anatomical diagram of upper body with liver highlighted" class="size-full wp-image-144992" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642-295x415.jpg 295w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642-600x844.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144992" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The liver usually recycles bile acid to dissolve and absorb dietary fats.

&lt;p&gt;However, Gibbons emphasized that more research is needed to define this optimal range more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographically, younger people, women, and those with a lower body mass index tended to have less frequent bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormonal and neurological differences between men and women may explain the gap, Gibbons said, along with the fact that men generally consume more food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144950" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642.png" alt="Food on a table with hands grabbing it" class="size-full wp-image-144950" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642-533x415.png 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642-600x467.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A more plant-dominant diet can have health benefits.

&lt;p&gt;"It was eating more fruit and vegetables, that was the biggest signal we saw," said Gibbons, along with drinking plenty of water, regular physical activity, and eating a more plant-dominant diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the research could involve designing a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="154973" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to manage the bowel movements of a large group of people, followed over an extended period to assess its potential in disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, the US has been experiencing its most severe flu season in more than a decade. After a slow start, the second severe wave of influenza overwhelmed the healthcare system of the USA with many hospital admissions. Brain complications among kids have been one of the most concerning trends that has been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 19,000 people have died this year including 68 children, out of whom at least nine had flu-associated brain complications, according to a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published on February 27. A Maryland family is yet to recover from the death of their 10-year-old daughter due to complications of flu. She was sent back from the hospital twice after receiving medication and flu. However, it didn't help as soon, as the girl couldn't feel her legs and feet. By the time she was rushed to hospital, her brain showed no activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's how the tragic incident unfolded&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka Aisha Greene, the healthy and lively 10-year-old developed low energy and a lack of appetite in late January, leaving her mother Kymesha Greene concerned. Greene noted that the girl's behavior changed. "She normally doesn’t get sick. This was like her first time getting sick,” the mother told DC News Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Minka was taken to the emergency room, she was diagnosed with the flu and a UTI. She was sent back home after receiving ibuprofen. However, soon the girl started experiencing headaches and was taken back to the hospital where she was given fluids and sent home for the second time again to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning, Minka's health deteriorated as she started vomiting in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard her screaming, ‘Mommy!’ And I’m like, ‘What’s wrong?’ That’s when she said she couldn’t feel her legs and her feet,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka who was not vaccinated for flu was rushed to hospital and on her way back Minka's eyes rolled to the back of her head and her tongue started moving uncontrollably. By the time they reached hospital, Minka stopped breathing. While CPR and other life-saving procedures were performed on her, the parents were told that their daughter had no brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was the last time I carried her, the last time I held her in my arms. I will cherish that for the rest of my life," said David, her father. The girl died on February 10 at the hospital. The heartbroken mother said they had to let their baby go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reason for Minka's death&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka suffered from severe brain inflammation caused by the flu.

In January, the CDC received anecdotal reports of kids getting affected by it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encephalopathy can cause brain dysfunction while encephalitis may cause brain swelling, according to the Cleveland Clinic. IAE symptoms include seizures, decreased level of consciousness, hallucinations and personality changes lasting more than 24 hours, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of influenza viruses&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of influenza viruses namely Flu A, and Flu B with the former considered more dangerous.

That's the case with a Cockatoo named Furby, who bosses his mama around and tells her when to stop and start filming him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He's just too adorable for words and such a smart fella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The sweetly hilarious video was uploaded to the TikTok account for @Furbythebirb, and everyone is so floored about how smart this sweetie is.

Don't record" and then he full on wilds out and tells her to record him because&lt;em&gt; he's flapping&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another person said, "I have seen plenty of birds that say words, but I’ve never seen one.

It's just such a sweet way to parent such an intelligent bird! She always asks him what he wants to do and if it's okay she does certain things with him, and it's just so kind and respectful. I'm pretty sure one of the reasons Furby is as amazing as he is has to do with the fact Robin is really careful with how she interacts with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/cockatoo-helps-mom-finish-work-day-in-hilarious-destructive-way" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Cockatoo 'Helps' Mom Finish Her Work Day Early in Hilariously Destructive Way;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Cockatoo 'Helps' Mom Finish Her Work Day Early in Hilariously Destructive Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Furby is such a smart Cockatoo, and it's so wonderful that his mom respects that so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Intelligent Are Cockatoos?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon-Crested Cockatoo tilting head while sitting on perch.

The article states: “Unlike most other mammals, &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/birds/best-bird-names" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:birds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; are very similar to humans in the way they perceive the world around them — being visually and auditorily oriented, as well as intelligent and highly spatial. Thus, it makes sense that birds would perform quite well on these tests, reflecting similarities to human children in cognitive development.” The conclusion was, “So far, the performances turned in by a number of corvid and parrot species do rival those of human toddlers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, the next time you hear someone use the phrase&lt;em&gt; bird brain &lt;/em&gt;to describe someone of low intelligence, you can feel free to correct them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 12:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVVh5OGFrbFlxTTJmeThTTEFtQ0xabUxsNlh4VTV2ZkY0aFR4ajhEd010TUpycTBRMDFSbXQ4MjJ4MExaa3FueGs0WUY4RjlXRTE2NlRGejRvSjJmUThwMlFGajZFTU93UFd2OVRPU1FwUFRKbzk0WGFjRFJwWkQzaUQ1dHdEU19YUElqVHByQQ</guid></item><item><title>Florida man eats feral pig meat, contracts rare biothreat bacteria - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPVzFxTzdEdW5ETU9reUJoakxORlBCODdzbWNYV3hPYmVxSmpjam1neXZ6SGZncFl6Ym9KOU9JOEQyUm5qcFJnWW9RazBkZmdVcWRDN0ZDNkx0T0lheFhwanZCTXd2dVk3bjc5NVlIVzRINXRMa0ZWX3BGTFV0a2xZUWdVNmJ1VlZyNE5yd1hHWWhrV182TmtMYjVhZ2RkMlpYN1haQnFHdl8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B. suis &lt;/em&gt;is an extremely infectious bacteria that's usually found in pigs. The most common symptom in pigs is reproductive losses, such as stillbirths, though they can also develop other symptoms, such as abscesses and arthritis. In humans, it causes an insidious, hard to detect infection called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;brucellosis&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to describe an infection from any &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; species: &lt;em&gt;B. suis, B. melitensis,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;B. abortus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;B. canis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, there are only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/BrucellosisFactSheet.pdf"&gt;80 to 140 brucellosis cases&lt;/a&gt; reported each year, and they're mostly caused by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/brucellosis"&gt;B. melitensis and B. abortus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. People tend to get infected by eating raw (unpasteurized) milk and cheeses. &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt;, however, is generally linked to hunting and butchering feral pigs and hogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; species were designated as select agents by the US government, a classification to flag pathogens and toxins that have the potential to be a severe threat to public health, such as if they're used in a bioterror attack. &lt;a href="https://www.selectagents.gov/sat/list.htm"&gt;The current list&lt;/a&gt; includes things like anthrax and Ebola virus. &lt;em&gt;Brucella &lt;/em&gt;species were originally listed because they can be easily aerosolized, and only a small number of the bacterial cells are needed to spark an infection. In humans, infections can be both localized and systemic and have &lt;a href="https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_suis.pdf"&gt;a broad range of clinical manifestations&lt;/a&gt;. Those include brain infections, neurological conditions, arthritis, anemia, respiratory involvement, pancreatitis, cardiovascular complications, like aneurysms, and inflammation of the spinal cord, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441831/"&gt;among many other things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/17/2024-29567/agricultural-bioterrorism-protection-act-of-2002-biennial-review-and-republication-of-the-select"&gt;In January&lt;/a&gt;, federal officials removed &lt;em&gt;Brucella &lt;/em&gt;species from the select agents list—a designation that limits the types and amount of research that can be done on a pathogen. According to the US Department of Agriculture, the reason for the removal was &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/aphis-updates-select-agents-toxins-registration-list-removes-agents"&gt;to ease those limits&lt;/a&gt;, thereby making it easier for researchers to conduct veterinary studies and develop vaccines for animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perilous present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt;, the doctors went to gather more information about how the man could have contracted this rare species. The man said he wasn't a hunter, but recalled receiving a gift of feral swine meat on several occasions in 2017 from a local hunter. Though he couldn’t recall the specific hunter who gave him the biohazardous bounty, he did remember handling the raw meat and blood with his bare hands—a clear transmission risk—before cooking and eating it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you need a quick meal, nothing hits the spot like a hot piece of cheesy &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/fast-food-pepperoni-pizzas-taste-test/" target="_blank"&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt; loaded with your favorite toppings. But not everyone has time to run to their favorite pizza joint or wait for delivery. That's where &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/tag/frozen-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;frozen pizza&lt;/a&gt; comes in and makes a good option for those in a time crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're in the mood for an all cheese pizza or one packed with meat and veggies, there's plenty of choices. An entire grocery aisle is dedicated to frozen pizza in many stores with affordable delicious options, making it easier on consumer's wallets for a fast cheap meal. In fact, according to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5030661/frozen-pizza-global-strategic-business-report?utm_source=GNE&amp;amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;amp;utm_code=tcq9st&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2031408+-+Frozen+Pizza+Industry+Analysis+Report+2024%3a+Global+Market+to+Reach+%2427.4+Billion+by+2030+from+%2420+Billion+in+2023+-+Online+Grocery+Trends+Influence+Sales+Dynamics&amp;amp;utm_exec=chdomspi" target="_blank"&gt;Research and Market&lt;/a&gt;, the global market for frozen pizza was at $21.2 billion last year and is projected to reach $27.4 billion by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;While you can't beat the convenience of a frozen pizza, it doesn't mean they're all healthy for you. Many are filled with so much salt and fat that if consumed often it could pose a serious health risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are key things to look for when shopping for a frozen pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories&lt;/strong&gt;: Depending on age range and fitness goals, on average, the guidelines for calorie intake range between 1,600 to 2,000, per &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-many-calories-a-day-should-i-eat#:~:text=Calories%20per%20day%20for%20men%20and%20people,moderately%20active%202%2C600%2066%E2%80%9375%20Calories:%20sedentary%202%2C000" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated fat&lt;/strong&gt;: Saturated fat is something you'll often find in frozen meals like pizza. According to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats#:~:text=AHA%20Recommendation,of%20saturated%20fat%20per%20day" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, if you're following a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, you should not have more than 13 grams of saturated fat. Too much can lead to serious health issues like high cholesterol and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium&lt;/strong&gt;: Some frozen pizza contain a lot of salt for flavor. While it might be tasty, you're risking your heart. The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; says too many Americans consume more salt than recommended. The organization suggests having no more than 2,300 milligrams a day, but many people have 3,500mg daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help guide you through the plethora of frozen pizzas, Eat This, Not That! spoke with dietitians who reveal the worst ones on the shelves ranked in order from unhealthiest to absolutely terrible for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p class="nutrinfo-black"&gt;&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/span&gt;: ⅕ of the pizza&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Calories&lt;/span&gt;: 320&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Fat&lt;/span&gt;: 16 g (Saturated fat: 8 g)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Sodium&lt;/span&gt;: 730 mg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Carbs&lt;/span&gt;: 28g (Fiber: 2g , Sugar: 3g)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Protein&lt;/span&gt;: 15g&lt;/p&gt;
        
&lt;p&gt;Pizza is already tasty enough, but when you add a cheese stuffed crust, it takes the pie to a whole other level, but one that's really bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you are looking for a better option health-wise for a frozen pizza – it would seem obvious to steer clear from a product with its crust stuffed with cheese and topped with cured meats," says Michelle Rauch MSc RDN, Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist for &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-rauch-msc-rdn-55a6773/" target="_blank"&gt;The Actors Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Digiorno's brags that each pizza is stuffed with 2 ½ feet of cheese in its crust in addition to what is on top of the product, but for only 1/5 of this pizza you'll be eating 320 calories, and 16g of fat (of which half is saturated)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the alarming amount of calories and fat for a small slice, salt is another concern to be aware of with this pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauch says, "One serving, which is just 1/5 of this pie contains 730 mg of sodium is half (48.6%) of the recommended daily sodium amount as recommended by the American Heart Association for those with conditions such has high blood pressure and kidney disease (1500mg) and approximately 1/3 (31.7%) for of the daily value for the general population (2300mg).  Some of the excessive sodium in this product is coming from the pepperoni and the cheeses."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a healthier choice, Rauch recommends a thinner crust without  extra meat and cheese toppings. Or make one yourself with fresh pizza dough and choose better ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://screaminsicilian.com/product/original-ultimate-deluxe/" target="_blank"&gt;Screamin' Sicilian Ultimate Deluxe&lt;/a&gt; has generous toppings with a variety of crunchy veggies, but according to Rauch, this frozen pizza doesn't deserve space in your freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says, "This pizza from Screamin' Sicilian is advertised as 'everything but the kitchen sink' with a buttery crust, mounds of whole-milk mozzarella cheese and 'piled high with Italian sausage, premium pepperoni", and some veggies such as peppers, onions, and mushrooms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean it should be eaten very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauch explains, "A single serving of the Ultimate Deluxe is listed as 1/5 of the pie which contains 350 calories and 770 mg of sodium. This is 33% of the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association's recommendatio&lt;/a&gt;n for sodium per day for the general population and just over half (51%) for those who are supposed to limit salt intake due conditions such as hypertension and kidney disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adds, "Italian meats such as sausage and pepperoni along with cheese are known to have a high salt content and should be limited for those with high blood pressure and kidney disease.  This high sodium product, if eaten, doesn't leave room to stay in those recommended guidelines for the remainder of the day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauch also emphasizes, "Once slice (based on the recommended serving size) contains 20g of fat – 8g of which is saturated.  The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; limited Saturated Fats to under 6% of your total calories per day.  To put that into perspective, if you are eating 2000 calories daily – you should not eat more than 13g of those types of fats per day.    In this case, you would have already gone over that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thin crust people is typically a bit healthier and has less calories and fat, but &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/violeta-morris" target="_blank"&gt;Violeta Morris&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN from Columbus, OH, The Concierge Dietitian, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://@conciergedietitianvioleta" target="_blank"&gt;@conciergedietitianvioleta&lt;/a&gt; says not to let the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.shopbernatellospizza.com/bellatoria-ultra-thin-crust-ultimate-supreme-%20pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;Bellatoria Ultimate Supreme Pizza&lt;/a&gt;  fool you into thinking it's healthier than other frozen pizzas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Its nutritional profile is quite like other frozen options, with 350 calories per serving, 20 grams of fat, 740 mg of sodium, 24 grams of carbohydrates, and 16 grams of protein," she says. "This pizza contains enriched flour and three types of sugar—sugar, dextrose, and maltodextrin—which add to its refined carbohydrate content, potentially raising its glycemic load and providing empty calories."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.goodnes.com/digiorno/products/croissant-crust-four-cheese-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;Digiorno Four Cheese Croissant Crust Pizza&lt;/a&gt; is a mouthwatering blend of four cheeses with a croissant crust, but Rauch says that it's not an "ideal choice" for healthy frozen pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Looking at this &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.goodnes.com/digiorno/crusts/croissant/" target="_blank"&gt;whole line from Diogiorno's&lt;/a&gt; – this is probably the 'better' choice over their 'croissant crusted' varieties of pepperoni or three meats." She explains, "If you are able to stop at just 1/5 of the pie (their calculated serving), that's almost 400 kcals (370 kcals), and 18g of fat – half of which (50%) is saturated.  It's no surprise with a product loaded with cheese, and a crust made of a French pastry.   Eating a diet high in fats can lead to an increase in cholesterol which in turn increases the risk of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;developing heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being high in fat, sodium is also a problem with this pizza, so avoid or eat very seldomly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no question the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.redbaron.com/products/fully-loaded-hand-tossed/fully-loaded-hand-tossed-meat-lovers.htm" target="_blank"&gt;RED BARON Fully Loaded Hand Tossed Meat Lovers Pizza&lt;/a&gt; is a dream for carnivores, but it's a nightmare for your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most labels show nutrition facts for 1/4 of the pizza, but for RED BARON Fully Loaded Hand Tossed Meat Lovers Pizza, the nutrition facts are for 1/6th of the pie meaning the fat, calories, and sodium are much higher when eaten in a typical volume," &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://entirelynourished.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS RD CDCES CDN, Preventive Cardiology Dietitian and Heart Health Expert at EntirelyNourished.com points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explains, "If you have 1/2 of this pizza, you would hit the upper limit of saturated fat for a day and surpass an upper sodium threshold for the day. We want to limit saturated fat since high levels can increase LDL cholesterol and lead to insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein explains the "Great Value Stuffed Crust Pepperoni Pizza is loaded with saturated fat, sodium, and made with simple carbohydrates, not offering much satisfaction at only 1/5th of a pizza!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adds, "Consuming more than 1/5th of the pie leads to very high saturated fat, sodium, and refined carbohydrate levels which can negatively impact cardiometabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While I, as a dietitian and a mother, understand the appeal of offering pizza occasionally to kids, it's important to recognize that frozen pizzas, like this one, are packed with empty calories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and lack essential nutrients," Morris says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pizza contains a high amount of sodium, saturated fat and calories, but Morris explains it's also ultra processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Research, including a 2024 review published in the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10899807/" target="_blank"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;, examined 45 studies involving nearly 10 million participants and found links between ultra processed foods and 32 health concerns, including cardiometabolic diseases, mental health issues, and higher mortality rates. As parents, it's important to be aware of these findings to make more informed decisions about what we feed our children."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the pizza is is marketed on their website as the #1 selling frozen pizza in the Chicagoland area and is now available nationwide that Morris advises to be very careful how much you consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a dietitian, it's important to be mindful of how many slices you're eating, as the nutritional content can add up quickly," she says. "After eating frozen pizza, ask yourself how long you feel full. While it may be a quick and convenient meal, it can leave you feeling unsatisfied and hungry again just a few hours later."&lt;/p&gt;

The disease no longer kills &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/world-tb-day/history/index.html#:~:text=In%201882%2C%20TB%20disease%20killed,more%20about%20this%20deadly%20disease."&gt;one in seven people&lt;/a&gt; in the US, as it did in the 19th century. But look elsewhere and its burden is still terrible: TB killed &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;more than 1.2 million people&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, likely making it once again the deadliest infection on Earth, after it was briefly supplanted by Covid-19 during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And as &lt;a href="/future-perfect/384524/john-green-author-youtuber-tuberculosis-advocacy-future-perfect-50"&gt;John Green&lt;/a&gt;, YA author, YouTuber, and author of the new book &lt;a href="https://www.johngreenbooks.com/everything-is-tuberculosis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Is Tuberculosis: The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told me in an interview: “That number is about to go up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As part of its &lt;a href="/future-perfect/404040/foreign-aid-cuts-trump-charts-usaid-pepfar-who-hiv"&gt;evisceration of US international aid&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration is ending funding for its global TB programs. The US is the world’s largest single funder of tuberculosis treatment, and the spending cuts &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/tuberculosis/usaid-funding-freeze-disrupts-global-tuberculosis-control-efforts#:~:text=TB%20medications%20that%20have%20already,is%20working%E2%80%94have%20been%20interrupted."&gt;quickly interrupted medical care&lt;/a&gt; for TB victims. And any delay in treatment &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/epidemiology/articles/10.3389/fepid.2023.1234865/full#:~:text=Introduction%3A%20Tuberculosis%20treatment%20interruption%20increases,occurrence%20of%20drug%20resistant%20Tuberculosis."&gt;can lead&lt;/a&gt; to worse outcomes for patients and makes it more likely the bacteria will evolve to resist antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“All of this is a direct result of the decisions made by the US government,” Green told me. “Allowing tuberculosis to spread unchecked throughout the world is bad news for all humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There may be as many as 10 million additional TB cases by 2030 because of the cuts, depending on how deep they ultimately are, according to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.04.25323340v1.full.pdf"&gt;one initial estimate&lt;/a&gt;.

One TB program director &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/10/us-aid-cuts-tuberculosis-tb-untreatable-bug-drug-resistance-stop-tb-partnership-who?utm_source=dlvr.it"&gt;told The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; last week their funding had still not resumed despite receiving a reassurance from the administration that it would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The funding freeze is not only a threat to people in the developing world who live with tuberculosis as an ever-present threat, Green told me — it also poses a risk to the US itself. Right now, Kansas has &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;68 active TB cases&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest US outbreaks in recent history. One estimate from the Center for Global Development &lt;a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/tuberculosis-doesnt-respect-borders-us-aid-cuts-could-fuel-global-health-crisis"&gt;finds that&lt;/a&gt; US TB cases will rise in parallel with cases in the rest of the world. That won’t just increase health care costs — it will increase the risk that TB will become more drug-resistant and therefore deadlier to people around the world, including in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I spoke with Green about the history of one of humanity’s oldest infectious diseases, the threat posed by the Trump administration’s cuts, and what concerned people can do in response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our conversation is below, edited for clarity and length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the state of tuberculosis right now? Why do people in the US and other wealthy countries often think of it as a disease of the past, a problem that has been solved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I used to think of it as a disease of the past as well. I thought of TB primarily as the &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/column-poet-john-keats-met-early-end#:~:text=Today%20marks%20the%20day%20in,Tom%2C%20who%20died%20in%201819."&gt;disease that killed John Keats&lt;/a&gt;, and then we figured out a solution to it, so now it’s not a threat anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But in fact, tuberculosis is still the world’s deadliest infectious disease. It kills over 1.2 million people per year. That number is about to go up. It sickens about 10 million people per year. Around a quarter of all living humans have experienced a TB infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, the vast majority of those people will never become sick. They’ll have what we call latent TB, where these clumps of white blood cells form what are called tubercles to surround the bacteria and keep it in check. But in about 10 percent of people who experience a TB infection, they will become sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We understand some of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/risk-factors/index.html"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for developing active TB disease. They include malnutrition, other health problems like diabetes, or HIV infection. But we don’t fully understand why some people develop active TB and others don’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You call the disease “weird” in your book. What is weird about TB? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The weirdest thing about TB is the cell wall that the bacteria builds. It builds this really thick, fatty cell wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That takes a long time to build, so TB has an extremely slow growth rate compared to other bacteria; in some cases, hundreds of times slower. That means that it sickens us slower because it takes a long time to overwhelm the body’s defenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is one of the reasons why tuberculosis used to be a narratively convenient disease, a disease that was the subject of so many books. It was a narratively compelling disease because it tends to take a life slowly over the course of months or years, rather than all at once like a disease like cholera or the black plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Classically, we understood death as something that occurred very early on in life because about half of people died before the age of 5, or something that occurred late in adulthood, in your 50s or after. Tuberculosis killed so many people in their 20s and 30s that it was called the robber of youth. But it also killed people early in childhood and late in adulthood. It killed indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To some extent, it still does. I mean, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/20-11-2024-inclusion-for-every-child--reaching-every-child-affected-by-tuberculosis"&gt;218,000 kids&lt;/a&gt; are going to die of tuberculosis this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s so frustrating to me is that all of those deaths are unnecessary because we’ve had a cure since the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This disease has been with us forever. It was even glamorized to an extent in earlier generations. But then there was a transition when it became more stigmatized — it became associated with being dirty and poor. How did that happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Until 1882, at least in Northern Europe and the United States, it was generally believed that tuberculosis was an inherited genetic condition. But in 1882, the German doctor &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#:~:text=On%20March%2024%2C%201882%2C%20Robert,tuberculosis%20and%20its%20causative%20agent."&gt;Robert Koch&lt;/a&gt; proved that tuberculosis was in fact caused by bacteria. The moment it became an infectious disease is really the moment that our imagining of the disease changed radically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Instead of being a disease of wealth and civilization, it became a disease of poverty. The implications of this were huge because it meant that we could control tuberculosis by trying to control the bacteria that caused TB. But it also meant that we wanted much more control over the lives of people living with tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We started to understand them very differently. We started to see people with tuberculosis as a threat to the social order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, by the middle of the 20th century, we developed vaccines and cures. How did our perception of TB continue to change — and how did race increasingly factor into it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;TB had &lt;a href="https://www.gresham.ac.uk/watch-now/tb-history"&gt;long been understood&lt;/a&gt; by Europeans as a racialized disease. It was widely believed in Europe and in the US among white doctors that only white people could get consumption because it was a disease of civilization. To acknowledge that consumption was common among people of color and colonized people would have been to undermine the entire project of colonialism itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After we understood the disease as infectious, it became racialized in a different way, where it came to be argued that people of color were uncommonly susceptible to tuberculosis. Instead of believing that it was impossible for them to get tuberculosis, people started to argue that their susceptibility to tuberculosis was owing to some factor inherent to race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, we knew this was hogwash from the beginning. There were lots of doctors, including African American doctors and researchers, pushing back against this notion. They argued, correctly, that the actual cause of tuberculosis was crowded living and working conditions, poor pay, malnutrition — all the stuff that today we know does cause tuberculosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the racialization of the disease was so profound that it’s still shaping who lives and dies of tuberculosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, how does tuberculosis look in the United States versus a place like Sierra Leone, which you cover extensively in your book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Starting in the 1940s, we began to develop &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ja2014108"&gt;treatments for tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; that were very powerful. We created combinations of multiple antibiotics that, given over the course of several months or even years, could cure tuberculosis. This disease that had always been one of the leading human killers suddenly became curable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Unfortunately, we did a really poor job of distributing this cure to the places where it was most needed. As a result, we’ve seen the development of extensive drug resistance for tuberculosis, and we’ve seen a huge amount of ongoing suffering from the disease. The Ugandan HIV researcher Dr. Peter Mugyenyi &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00222-9/fulltext"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of HIV drugs in the year 2000: “Where are the drugs? The drugs are where the disease is not. And where is the disease? The disease is where the drugs are not.” And that’s very much the case with tuberculosis as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you or I got tuberculosis tomorrow, even if we had a complex drug-resistant case, we would get access to the best personalized, tailored treatments of antibiotic cocktails we would need in order to cure our TB. But for someone like my friend Henry living in Sierra Leone, when he got really sick in 2019 and 2020, those drugs weren’t available to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So even though his TB was very curable, his life was at risk — not ultimately because of a lack of technology, but because of failure to get the technology to the places where it’s most needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book, you called TB both a form and an expression of injustice. It seems to me that TB is one very striking example of a pattern of injustice that applies across a lot of diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah. I think it’s really important to acknowledge that tuberculosis is not the only disease of injustice. &lt;a href="/future-perfect/369095/hepatitis-vaccine-deaths-symptoms-infections"&gt;Hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; is a disease of injustice. &lt;a href="/future-perfect/395355/malaria-vaccines-rollout-children-rtss-r21"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/explain-it-to-me/396016/hiv-aids-cure-pepfar-who-progress"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/the-highlight/24093360/early-cancer-young-adults-colon-stomach-research"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; are diseases of injustice. When my brother got cancer, one of the first things he said to me was that there was a 94 percent cure rate if you have access to treatment, and about a 5 percent cure rate if you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s very hard to grapple with the fact that the real cause of a huge percentage of human death is injustice — the failures of human-built systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are many deaths that we simply don’t have the technology or the tools to prevent. But there are many, many, many, many deaths that we do have the technologies and tools to prevent. It’s important to understand that as a justice problem, as an equity problem, as a failure to appropriately apportion the resources that we as a human species have developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It breaks my heart. It’s devastating. I’m often asked whether I think people are good. Like, at the end of this book, do I think people are good? And I can’t answer that question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What I can say is I think people are capable of extraordinary generosity and compassion and sacrifice. When people are proximal to suffering, they show an extraordinary capacity for giving. And when people are not proximal to suffering, when people don’t let themselves become close to the suffering of others, they can act monstrously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There has been imperfect progress on global health, but progress nonetheless. But now the US government is pulling back from the global health commitments that have helped make that progress possible. What does this mean for TB specifically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The United States has long been the most generous donor when it comes to fighting TB, and now essentially all tuberculosis-related funding has been &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives#:~:text=This%20funding%20was%20approximately%20one,been%20the%20largest%20bilateral%20donor."&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt;. That’s catastrophic on a number of levels. To my Republican friends and congressional representatives, I try to compare it to the 2008 financial crisis when the capital markets just froze, and it was very hard to get them to start working again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In many communities, that’s what’s happening as a result of this sudden, chaotic, very unpredictable, haphazardly rolled-out funding freeze. Hundreds of thousands of people have seen their treatment &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/tuberculosis/usaid-funding-freeze-disrupts-global-tuberculosis-control-efforts"&gt;interrupted&lt;/a&gt;, and we know that’s a catastrophe, not only for those individuals, many of whom will die, perhaps most of whom tragically will die, but also because it means that they will develop &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/10/us-aid-cuts-tuberculosis-tb-untreatable-bug-drug-resistance-stop-tb-partnership-who?utm_source=dlvr.it"&gt;drug resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even a couple of weeks without getting access to your medication means a skyrocketing chance of drug resistance. Even if they’re able to get back on treatment, the relatively inexpensive treatment that worked before may no longer work. That means more cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis circulating in communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s also a threat to the United States. We have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7312a4.htm#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%2050%20U.S.,0.8%20cases%20per%20100%2C000%20persons."&gt;10,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; of active tuberculosis in the US every year. We have a tuberculosis outbreak right now in &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/tuberculosis-in-kansas-the-larger-picture"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. Tuberculosis anywhere is a threat to people everywhere and allowing tuberculosis to spread unchecked throughout the world is bad news for all humans. It’s bad news for human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’ve made so much progress in human health during my lifetime. The year I graduated from high school, 12 million children died under the age of 5. Last year, &lt;a href="/future-perfect/24100883/child-mortality-rate-worldwide-united-nations"&gt;fewer than 5 million did&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s easy to feel like that progress is inevitable or natural or somehow it was always going to happen. But it wasn’t always going to happen. It happened because millions of people worked together to make it happen, because we decided collectively to value children’s lives more and to work hard to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now what we’re seeing is the first regression of my lifetime when it comes to overall human health. We’re seeing it in the United States where life expectancy &lt;a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/healthy-aging/whats-behind-the-decline-in-american-life-expectancy/"&gt;has been going down&lt;/a&gt;. We’re about to see it globally where tuberculosis cases, by one estimate, will increase by 30 percent over the next couple of years, leading to 13 million people getting sick every year instead of 10 million and leading to hundreds of thousands more people dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of this is a direct result of the decisions made by the US government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like it’s hard for people to understand the feedback loop that’s potentially in play here that can put our health at risk because diseases are spreading elsewhere. I think it’s also hard for us to take the long view.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious where you think that failure comes from? And have you seen anything that’s sort of effective in overcoming that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I think we have to bridge the empathy gap. There’s always an empathy gap between every person, right? I don’t know what it’s like to be you. I don’t know about your joys and sorrows. And even when I do, I can only kind of situate them in my own experience. I can only relate to it through my own eyes because those are the only eyes I get to see through for the whole time that I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And so there’s always an empathy gap, but that empathy gap grows or shrinks based on how close you allow yourself to be to the suffering and joy of others. And so you know when my uncle gets sick, I’m going to respond to that very differently than if I hear through the grapevine that someone else’s uncle is sick. And for me, the empathy gap is also a social justice gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The further the rich world feels from someone’s life, the less likely the rich world is to intervene. So for me, it’s about shrinking that empathy gap everywhere we can so that we understand that the lives of other people, even other people whose lives may feel distant from ours are just as real and just as important as ours, that their joy and grief and longing and loss is as real and profound as ours is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I try to do that in the book by telling Henry’s story because you can talk all day about what a great investment tuberculosis response is, and it is a great long-term financial investment. You can talk all day about how many people are dying of TB every year. All that just boils down to statistics. And the statistics don’t decrease the empathy gap, at least for me. And so I wanted to tell a human story at a human scale because I feel like that’s what really changes our perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What options are available to people like Vox readers, who want to contribute in some small way to making these problems better? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It sounds meaningless and everybody says it, but it’s true. When you reach out to your congressional representatives insofar as you’re lucky enough to have some say in your governance, it really matters. What funding we’ve been able to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-restores-some-aid-humanitarian-groups-ask-where-is-money-2025-03-07/"&gt;claw back for USAID&lt;/a&gt; is a result of people reaching out to their senators and representatives and those senators and representatives in turn reaching out to Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio and saying, “This is ridiculous. This can’t happen.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s really, really important that people in power hear that it is unacceptable for the United States to walk away from its long-term commitments to global health and human health, and that it’s unacceptable for the United States to break its promises. They need to hear it’s also bad for America. It’s bad for farmers who provide food aid. It’s bad for overall human health in the United States. We’re seeing our own numbers of tuberculosis cases go up every year, and that will accelerate now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQQVYybEZKWENKdFQ0T0VUMTZySWtQMUU0aE5QMnp6WEktb2g3c00yU2RMc1dSclV5Z2lqXzJwYmh6SV9MTE9PbjhKMFJ0SnRMazJuVUNtMXRzZ1ZuR2pnX3lGWWYyRnJKU3hFeUF3RVZTTWR6ZzFhZWpjaTlfSHctSlN0RklHSmM</guid></item><item><title>S.F. may stop giving free foil and pipes to drug users.

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlh9iq000v26oxfsb49khv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the early 2000s, when Dr. Alexandra Cvijanovich was completing her medical training in Utah, her team cared for a 13-year-old boy with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001185.htm#:~:text=Subacute%20sclerosing%20panencephalitis%20(SSPE)%20is,Walker%20Boulevard%2C%20Augusta%20GA%2030912." target="_blank"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, a degenerative neurological disease that can be fatal. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=Subacute%20sclerosing%20panencephalitis%20(SSPE)%20is,10%20years%20after%20measles%20infection." target="_blank"&gt;rare complication&lt;/a&gt; of the measles virus that appears years after the initial infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00023b5vzytp5e1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The boy had been infected with measles when he was 7 months old, after contact with an unvaccinated child. Years later, he died of the complications, and Cvijanovich has never forgotten about him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00033b5vl58o0njg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He … got the virus before he could be immunized. And that’s just a tragic, horrible, preventable death,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00043b5vw9e58sdo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials recommend that children get their first dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;12 and 15 months&lt;/a&gt; of age. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the measles virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ezmdvv00013b6mtfn69zry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To achieve herd immunity, where enough people are vaccinated that infection doesn’t widely spread in the community, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of the population needs to be vaccinated, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00053b5vwfqa9sfd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now a pediatrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Cvijanovich treats people from all over the state – including the southeastern region, which is currently part of one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/health/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-oklahoma"&gt;more than 300&lt;/a&gt; people across three states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00063b5v8wgn9zx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She often tells the story of her 13-year-old patient to families that are hesitant to vaccinate their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00073b5vjv7sqlbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I tried to use stories of patients that I’ve taken care of,” she said, “and then I also tried to plead with people that they actually think about the greater good of the community around them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00083b5viqo5pcl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many pediatricians say they are seeing an increase in parents who are hesitant to vaccinate their children with the MMR vaccine and others. Here are some of their tips for communicating with vaccine-hesitant parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000a3b5v0qltwc67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the key to communicating with families about vaccination is to address their specific concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000b3b5v0ccunfj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tailoring your approach and your communication to that family-specific concern has been the most effective for me and my practice,” said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a primary care pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “That is really what helps families feel confident about their choice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000c3b5vxrmzr9uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For some families, this includes addressing worries about side effects they may hear through anecdotes in their communities. Pediatricians say these often circulate in community or family WhatsApp groups or through parent Facebook groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000d3b5vrzz6ktad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So I am taking time to say, ‘pull it up, let’s look it up together. Who did it come from? Do you know this person? Do you know their full medical history?’ ” Bracho-Sanchez said. “And I do spend time outlining the difference between something happening to someone around the time that they had a vaccine and someone having something happen as a result of the vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000e3b5v0m3eemnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts warn against getting medical advice or information from community social media and urge patients to have conversations with their providers instead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000f3b5vnkdhgvkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other families may have concerns about specific ingredients in vaccines, and doctors recommend understanding which ones are causing worries, like metals or preservatives. Explaining how those same ingredients might also be found in foods or other daily life exposures can quell those fears, according to Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000h3b5vkai9xx43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As Cvijanovich has found with her own experiences, helping patients understand the illnesses they are preventing with vaccination can be helpful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000i3b5vp0khe9zf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines have been victims of their own success,” Johns said. “We don’t see many of these vaccine-preventable illnesses anymore [and] people think they’re no big deal. And the fact is that they really are a very big deal.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000j3b5vrgcnl70h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With measles, the consequences can be severe. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Encephalitis.,deaf%20or%20with%20intellectual%20disability." target="_blank"&gt;One in five&lt;/a&gt; unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis, or swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000k3b5vgo32ny0o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/health/measles-vaccine-shot-booster-adults-wellness"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One to three in 1,000 children who have measles will die from complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. A school-age child who was not vaccinated is among the two deaths that have already been associated with the ongoing measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000l3b5vj0j8ius2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being a pediatrician, watching my patients grow up, that’s the best part of my job,” Cvijanovich said. “I mean, that’s why I go into work every day. I love seeing babies who then enter middle school and graduate from high school and go off to college. That’s fantastic. And the best tool I have to accomplish this is vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000n3b5v5a2pkz8k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some pediatricians say that approaching these conversations in “partnership” has gone a long way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000o3b5v2buhn8pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pediatricians want what’s best for your child. That’s why I’m in this business, and I know that is true for you as a parent about your own child,” Johns said. “So given that, let’s talk through why you’re concerned that this might not be the best thing for your child and why I’m convinced that it is. And let’s sort through that together.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000p3b5vd0af86a1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even when parents might be fearful about getting certain vaccines for their children, trust in doctor-patient relationships can be helpful, according to Bracho-Sanchez.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000q3b5v8em1qljx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some parents will still say, ‘OK, I trust you, Doctor. Let’s go ahead and do this.’ But it doesn’t mean that they’re completely fearless, right? They trust me and our relationship and my explanation and the conversations that we have, [which is] enough to go ahead and vaccinate,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000r3b5vpgojwb60@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even if parents choose not to vaccinate their children at the end of an appointment, doctors can leave the door open for future conversation and continuing dialogue, Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8eyglqk00023b5v16tcl9dy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials say the current measles outbreak, which started in West Texas, is rooted in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt; whose members may not seek traditional health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ey6gls00003b5v1a71pseo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In talking with members of the community, we’re not necessarily seeing that this is hesitancy … around religion. We’re seeing it much more as they have been impacted, just like the rest of Americans with a lot of the social media,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said at a briefing Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f045rp00003b5v5r0i6631@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she has found one-on-one conversations or community health workers meeting with small groups to be most useful in addressing this hesitancy in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000t3b5vzfecq36s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Anti-vaccine websites and misinformation have become “more sophisticated,” Cvijanovich said. This raises the amount of concerns that many parents have when considering whether to vaccinate their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000u3b5v2hrkdhtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important not to be dismissive and not to be superior. Not say, ‘Well, I have my MD degree, and therefore, I learned how to analyze data, and you don’t know this,’” she said. Doctors need to be “understanding that there is a vast amount of information available to parents these days, and it is a constant challenge to figure out what’s accurate and what’s inaccurate, what’s misleading.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f04p6n00023b5v7cgyn426@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some false claims have spread so broadly that Cvijanovich says some of her patients are not so much “vaccine-hesitant” as “anti-vaccine.” She described a family that expressed that they think the measles cases in New Mexico are a “conspiracy to try to get their kids vaccinated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f0b8mu00053b5vx407eyh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So [my] arguments, they do tend to fall on deaf ears, unfortunately, but I continue to have the discussions,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000w3b5vsadbacz2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With any infectious disease, the spread affects not only individuals but communities. With a virus as contagious as measles, which can stay airborne for two hours even after an infected person leaves a room, its effect on entire communities is heightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000x3b5vuocirfar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some doctors have found that highlighting protection for the whole over the self can be an effective strategy in encouraging vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000y3b5vcmixb0nt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sometimes, people are willing to get infected and deal with the side effects that you do get infected, but sometimes you can reach them if they realize, ‘hey, I’m not just talking about myself. I can make potentially other people sick, too,’ ” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

These autopsies revealed a reduced presence of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology among regular egg consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that egg consumption may have a protective effect on the brain, potentially slowing the progression of Alzheimer's-related changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis indicated that 39 percent of the protective effect of egg consumption was mediated through dietary choline, a nutrient abundant in eggs that is essential for brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline assists in the production of neurotransmitters, particularly acetylcholine, which is vital for memory and cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline, found in abundance in eggs, supports the structural integrity of brain cell membranes and aligns with previous research linking choline intake to enhanced cognitive function. This study strengthens evidence proposing a connection between choline consumption and mental acuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of choline-rich diets for brain health are increasingly recognized; such diets may include foods like eggs. With Alzheimer's disease being a major contributor to dementia worldwide, the link between diet and cognitive aging grows more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Ball, Professor of Community Health and Wellbeing, and Karly Bartrim, Lecturer in Nutrition and Dietetics at The University of Queensland, discussed the study's findings from a food questionnaire on The Conversation website. They queried participants about the frequency of their egg consumption in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals reported their egg consumption as rare—possibly once a month, 1-6 times a week, or daily. The researchers observed, "Overall, people who consumed eggs 1–6 times per week had the lowest risk of death during the study period (29% lower for heart disease deaths and 17% lower for overall deaths) compared to those who rarely or never ate eggs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, they clarified, "Eating eggs daily did not increase the risk of death either."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the cholesterol content leading some to demonize eggs due to potential health impacts, this study offers a more encouraging perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol often lurks in the shadows, ominously dubbed the "silent killer" due to its symptom-free presence until it starkly manifests in serious health issues like heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:48:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPR0FicG14MlNxYzNXQlRtYTBUMGw2QWlSS2hLbUM4RHNpdS1wNGNZWFJwMjY1SXU0aTdWeE1aMnFENDJFTGRraU9ZOUxHcGtLMUNLRmdWTU5xUDZaSTg5Y2VsOU9vekFkcUNUYjZpLUFveGlOUnU2RDJPQ0hyRVVCbWFTcXJhaGptcE0w0gGQAUFVX3lxTE0waFdRaU9iaFhSdDUzd0dFMnNHTUd6RHdQMUxxOW1GbW5jdERXTGcwMWVCV19PU1RKS3lJdnRod3ZDUUc5d1NES3BmSWVqZGhGYmx5dWd0NHhFMXc1bG5pa0ZfRU9qNlNJWG1Ncmg0X2kzQkZ2bjJReV94Tm9MOHNwZ1N6R211U25XY2JjeWVTcQ</guid></item><item><title>Measles outbreak could last a year, health official in Texas says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQQ3FSTFlRSnN4Y0lHYThyT2xodTBGQ2NwSGlkT3ZGcGFTY1lwMHF6eGF3LTY4U2M2ME0zMVltTndUakNOWF96S3ZVRFJ0aF9vSnJzaEd0THRDeExrSXFmTFlMd1RLcTFmenZCanhvZkxyR2JCRnpXcmZCLVdkWGRQN0xvOVBZRTR0NnNWb0xWZEEyZy1DR2fSAYwBQVVfeXFMTy1CeHRfMzExYUNRdUx6bEtLT0o4ZnhwSkFUWS0wVnRzRXVIN0xTMUNxVWtJLXhoUmFkdVBYOEwtaGhXcnB2a1BvS2NxcjU3YWluZDBwc0lzWklacGx6U2R6NUtBZS1iMjJNWFhieS02bTFIQ1VjY0JqOTdtMVEwS1VPMDlEOGxlNU9Kc1o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Three hundred and twenty-one cases have been reported in the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, the states said Tuesday. This is an increase of 25 cases since an update on Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000c3b5v5qu6qps3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas has reported 279 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico has reported 38 cases, and Oklahoma had previously reported four cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000d3b5v2r0cfspz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirty-eight patients have been hospitalized, an increase of two over last week. Ninety-five cases are in children up to age 4, and 130 are among young people ages 5 to 17. Cases have been identified in 11 Texas counties and two New Mexico counties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000e3b5v89day62j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Texas, the bulk of the cases, 191, are in Gaines County, where the outbreak was first identified. In New Mexico, most cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma State Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; said last week that it had four measles cases in people with “exposure associated with the Texas and New Mexico outbreak.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000g3b5vk5car7q3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although most of the cases are in people who were unvaccinated or who had unknown vaccination status, six were found in people who said they have received at least one dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine: two in Texas and four in New Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpq000h3b5v0peba4em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last month, Texas announced the outbreak’s first death, a school-age child who was not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Health officials in New Mexico are continuing to investigate the cause of death of an unvaccinated person who tested positive for measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2tu000023b5vtze33pvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Given the highly contagious nature of the disease, officials expect continued spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000j3b5v6k1xb69q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases. … I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said at a briefing Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000k3b5vgyjkqsji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just think, it being so rural now, multistate, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000l3b5vk7p11roe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, officials say that increased testing capacity will be helpful in containing the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000m3b5vxjztejrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Labs have been set up in Lubbock, close to the epicenter of the outbreak. This means specimens no longer need to be sent via plane to Austin, reducing the time to get results from 72 hours to the same day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000n3b5vocpq0hji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At Tuesday’s briefing, officials noted that identifying cases, exposures and unvaccinated people was critical in curtailing a measles outbreak in Chicago last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000o3b5vevnq94ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as we continue to have a pool of unvaccinated people, it will continue to spread. So it’s very hard to say it has peaked unless you have successfully vaccinated everyone who is unvaccinated,” said Dr. Olusimbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000p3b5v36irgtwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html#:~:text=Over%2030%2C000%20doses%20of%20measleswithout%20the%20City's%20rapid%20intervention." target="_blank"&gt;30,000&lt;/a&gt; MMR vaccinations were given to Chicago residents during the outbreak,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which kept it from crossing the 100-case mark, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a2.htm?s_cid=mm7319a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the outbreak stopped at 64 reported cases, most of them linked to a shelter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epulfv00003b5vd39sxuwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to a CNN tally, there have been at least 353 cases reported in the US as of March 18. This already surpasses the total number of cases for all of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpq000j3b5v1kisi7c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, there were 285 total measles cases reported in the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is only the third year since measles was eliminated in the US in 2000 that an outbreak has led to more 200 cases. The others were 2014, when there was an outbreak tied to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/health/disneyland-measles/index.html"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;, and 2019, when a nearly year-long outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;in New York&lt;/a&gt; came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000b3b5v8lb9wv16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has been assisting efforts on the ground in Texas, and Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, says local efforts are “dependent” on federal support.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000c3b5vzsabgj1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our staffing to be able to do vaccination clinics and our epidemiology staff to do the investigations and contact tracing … so much of that is federally funded that we are very dependent on and very concerned about some of the potential staffing cuts that we’re seeing at the federal level, as well as some of the budget cuts,” he said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2tu000023b5vtze33pvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Given the highly contagious nature of the disease, officials expect continued spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000j3b5v6k1xb69q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases. … I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said at a briefing Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000k3b5vgyjkqsji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just think, it being so rural now, multistate, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000l3b5vk7p11roe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, officials say that increased testing capacity will be helpful in containing the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000m3b5vxjztejrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Labs have been set up in Lubbock, close to the epicenter of the outbreak. This means specimens no longer need to be sent via plane to Austin, reducing the time to get results from 72 hours to the same day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000n3b5vocpq0hji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At Tuesday’s briefing, officials noted that identifying cases, exposures and unvaccinated people was critical in curtailing a measles outbreak in Chicago last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000o3b5vevnq94ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as we continue to have a pool of unvaccinated people, it will continue to spread. So it’s very hard to say it has peaked unless you have successfully vaccinated everyone who is unvaccinated,” said Dr. Olusimbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000p3b5v36irgtwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html#:~:text=Over%2030%2C000%20doses%20of%20measleswithout%20the%20City's%20rapid%20intervention." target="_blank"&gt;30,000&lt;/a&gt; MMR vaccinations were given to Chicago residents during the outbreak,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which kept it from crossing the 100-case mark, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a2.htm?s_cid=mm7319a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the outbreak stopped at 64 reported cases, most of them linked to a shelter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epulfv00003b5vd39sxuwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to a CNN tally, there have been at least 353 cases reported in the US as of March 18. This already surpasses the total number of cases for all of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpq000j3b5v1kisi7c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, there were 285 total measles cases reported in the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is only the third year since measles was eliminated in the US in 2000 that an outbreak has led to more 200 cases. The others were 2014, when there was an outbreak tied to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/health/disneyland-measles/index.html"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;, and 2019, when a nearly year-long outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;in New York&lt;/a&gt; came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000b3b5v8lb9wv16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has been assisting efforts on the ground in Texas, and Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, says local efforts are “dependent” on federal support.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000c3b5vzsabgj1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our staffing to be able to do vaccination clinics and our epidemiology staff to do the investigations and contact tracing … so much of that is federally funded that we are very dependent on and very concerned about some of the potential staffing cuts that we’re seeing at the federal level, as well as some of the budget cuts,” he said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The boxes are cardboard and contain individual plastic packages of products. The lot code and best-by date 11152026 is stamped on products. The pet food was distributed in California, Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N4R3FEPUZBBIPDBX2JJK337HRE"&gt;New York City health officials this week urged consumers to avoid Savage Pet products because of the cats' illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GDVAKAR3ENFTVASQD2NOLJTT6Y"&gt;One cat fell ill and died this month after eating the Savage Pet products. Final test results are pending, but a preliminary test for H5N1 was “nonnegative,” which indicates that a certain amount of virus was detected, a department spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WU5OMVCLVRGB3GTERA2Y4FRN5E"&gt;A second cat was diagnosed with H5N1 and died — and tests suggested it was infected with a strain related to that found in the recalled Savage Pet food. However, that cat did not eat the food; it was exposed to a third cat that fell ill after eating the food from the implicated lot. That cat survived but was not tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UWQD2WN6XFBNJHJ75Q2LKF7CLE"&gt;The New York cases are the latest reports of cats in several states sickened and killed by H5N1.

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74391"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74392"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74393"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNTl9sWkJCUENacWhpNEdKMVFXZ1V6akYxVjFkNlM4bHdLMEdDVkE5SXFGZk9TUHJXeDRuZTdiRU4xcTZiS3FOR0s3NGNXb2Yzc1lpbjNDTGhkTU9XdlF0RUlDR1lKMGdseG5wTmEwdjl4RVFCdGRNR0hSM3JjdldEM0p4dTM1WndFNGxZRkN1QmFWVDNWNFhHMHRtWVJjb0FvYi1tTGN3</guid></item><item><title>One food lowers blood pressure 'as effectively as beta blockers' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOOU5aR1JXVGpnWUR3ZGJYVTQyTnh1SW5aaFpsLUdDVkRHald6cG1VZnZBbHU4TzNpVVpKUEJBd0NsRVdBOFVvb1VnWDN0VlMwRHhRNllwQ08tSW9ya2NZRXdHMUFyVlhoTlFVcklseDBJcGo1TDdGSXF0R2t6c0I4Y3F0SzBQdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is a potentially lethal condition made even more dangerous by the fact that it can have no symptoms until you fall seriously ill. High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high. Over time, this can lead to serious health complications, even if there are no immediate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can lead to heart attacks and strokes, heart failure, aneurysms, kidney failure, blindness and dementia as well as erectile dysfunction - among other conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition, which is detected through a simple, blood pressure test using a cuff inflated around the arm, is usually treated with lifestyle changes and medication. But one expert says there is also another solution you can add to help bring blood pressure down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Karen Keane, lecturer at Northumbria University, Newcastle, said drinking cherry concentrate can lower blood pressure for up to three hours. She told &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cherry-concentrate-can-lower-blood-pressure-as-much-as-drugs-our-study-finds-58521" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; : "Tart Montmorency cherries are rich in a number of plant compounds that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In cell and animal models, cherry extracts have been shown to have a range of cardiovascular health effects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the biggest killer, globally. In Europe, CVD is the leading cause of death in adults and is responsible for nearly half (48%) of all deaths. And in the US, 25% of deaths are attributed to CVD – that’s about 610,000 premature deaths each year. Raised blood pressure is the greatest risk factor for cardiovascular disease and even small reductions in blood pressure can have a big impact on mortality rates."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Northumbria University has undertaken a number of studies into the health benefits of tart Montmorency cherry concentrate. Karen said: "We have have found that drinking the concentrate improves the quality and quantity of sleep. It also reduces gout symptoms."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added: "In this study, we examined the acute effects of the consumption of Montmorency tart cherries on arterial stiffness, blood pressure and dilation of small blood vessels in men with early hypertension. Sixteen non-smoking men with early hypertension (with systolic blood pressure of 130mmHg or above, and diastolic blood pressure of 80mmHg or above – or both) took part in the study. At the start of the study, the participants provided a blood sample and we assessed their general cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Each participant then received either Montmorency tart cherry concentrate, diluted with water, or a placebo (fruit cordial). We took blood samples and assessed cardiovascular function one, two, three, five and eight hours after they drank the juice. Blood pressure was taken hourly. No food or drink was provided during the study period except for mineral water. Each person returned to the lab at least two weeks after the first visit to repeat the test with the other intervention drink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is the first study to show that drinking cherry juice can lower systolic blood pressure. Previous studies have demonstrated that foods such as cocoa, beetroot, and grape extract can also have a positive effect on blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Our study is particularly noteworthy because data from observational studies have shown that lowering average (mean) systolic blood pressure by 5-6mmHg over a five-year period is associated with a 38% reduced risk of stroke and a 23% reduced risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Compared with the placebo, we found that cherry juice concentrate reduced peak blood pressure by 7mmHG. The blood pressure lowering effects of cherry juice are comparable to those achieved by some antihypertensive drugs – such as beta blockers and diuretics – in people with mild hypertension. Our findings suggest that Montmorency cherries could be used alongside standard treatment to manage hypertension."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOOU5aR1JXVGpnWUR3ZGJYVTQyTnh1SW5aaFpsLUdDVkRHald6cG1VZnZBbHU4TzNpVVpKUEJBd0NsRVdBOFVvb1VnWDN0VlMwRHhRNllwQ08tSW9ya2NZRXdHMUFyVlhoTlFVcklseDBJcGo1TDdGSXF0R2t6c0I4Y3F0SzBQdw</guid></item><item><title>Debunked myths that vaccines cause autism are increasing stigma - The Guardian US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBuQ2VpTzVOQ0tkVFFuVVBaMXdzSkw3b0J4YlNPaEtBWkhCLWVyU0V2SVhnWVMwb2pNeDJQY1Z3bkU0ZnhTS2VKRi1JLS13ajRfZzFMLVVraW5aLVZwbHREVkdfZHFRNmNzTHdPNDZ1b2VCZUY4NUlDMjB4dEZNeTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/cdc-study-vaccines-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;planning to devote research dollars&lt;/a&gt;

Many autistic people make it to adulthood without a diagnosis – despite the challenges that come even with mild cases, they are able to live independently. Others require lifetime support. While autism as a disability is defined by impairments, it is also associated with strengths, including &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/aut.2021.0037" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dedication, focus and creativity in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Even in more challenging cases, parents of autistic children find it repugnant that other parents are risking their own children’s serious illness or death, ostensibly to avoid the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kate Abarca, a retired occupational therapist in South Carolina, says that learning to understand her son’s autism was immensely rewarding. Caring for him made her a better therapist, and advocating for him helped her overcome her shyness. Now 35, her son Benjamin Beals is beloved in his community. He lives in a semi-independent facility and is known for his karaoke performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ff65e2ed-405a-4187-b78a-019a27fe87c1" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":13,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Measles outbreak spreads as 250 cases reported across multiple states","elementId":"ff65e2ed-405a-4187-b78a-019a27fe87c1","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/measles-outbreak-spread"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":6,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Abarca realized early that her son’s difficulties stemmed from her own inability to understand his needs.

Knapp, along with others contacted for this story, suspects that anti-vaxxers see autism as a combination of exaggerated stereotypes stemming from misunderstood behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knapp was diagnosed with autism at 63.

It is possible that the version found in the chickens is circulating in wild birds, but most researchers think it probably acquired it’s deadly attributes once it got into the Noxubee chicken operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if that’s the case, “my money is on a one-and-done, perhaps with some local spread,” said Richard Webby, an infectious disease expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webby said most bird flu outbreaks follow that pattern: A low-pathogenic version is introduced to commercial poultry, and it becomes highly pathogenic once inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of H5N1 — the bird flu virus that’s been infecting dairy cows, commercial poultry, pet cats, wild animals and wild birds since March 2024 — into poultry and livestock populations was a notable exception to this trend: It was already circulating among wild birds and animals as a highly pathogenic virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Korslund, a veterinarian and former USDA researcher, agreed with Webby and noted that the operation housed breeder broilers: Chickens that are grown and maintained for breeding purposes, not for their meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is significant because breeders live for months, if not years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a low-pathogenic virus “happens to get into a broiler meat flock, the birds don’t get sick and they go onto slaughter,” he said. But when a breeder flock picks up that virus, “the virus can replicate for weeks ... this may well be what happened in Mississippi.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-9/chapter-I/subchapter-G/part-145" target="_blank"&gt;USDA rules&lt;/a&gt;, routine and periodic testing of breeder birds for low-pathogenic avian influenzas is required. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/usda-avian-influenza-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;In 2017, an outbreak of H7N9 &lt;/a&gt;occurred along the Mississippi flyway, probably starting in late February, but reported only in March. A summary report of the outbreak suggested the virus was introduced via wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As suspected in this case, it is believed it started as “low path” and only became “high path” once it got into the commercial operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, experts said, if they are wrong and a highly pathogenic virus is circulating in wild birds, it’ll start popping up in other states and sites too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Time will tell how nasty it gets this time,” Korslund said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to preventing these kinds of outbreaks — or at least getting ahead of them — is wildlife surveillance, the experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agencies such as the USDA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Wildlife Health Center, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have divisions that are tasked with sampling wild birds and other animals for infectious diseases. The information they gather is then used by agriculture and public health officials to determine where and when to bolster biosecurity, or to keep a lookout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without that information, said &lt;a class="link" href="https://angelarasmussen.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Angela Rasmussen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Canada.”we’re flying blind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the positive news that came out this week, &lt;a class="link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1485_article?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_1315-DM145916&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Influenza%20Articles%20in%20the%20March%202025%20Emerging%20Infectious%20Diseases%20Journal&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_1315-DM145916" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a team of international &lt;a class="link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1485_article?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_1315-DM145916&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Influenza%20Articles%20in%20the%20March%202025%20Emerging%20Infectious%20Diseases%20Journal&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_1315-DM145916" target="_blank"&gt;researchers found that&lt;/a&gt; ferrets  exposed to a common seasonal human flu — H1N1 — before being exposed to H5N1, acquire some immunity from the seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferrets that weren’t exposed to the seasonal flu before being infected with H5N1 had high levels of the virus in their respiratory tissues, as well as detectable virus in their hearts, spleen, liver and intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, those that had been exposed to the seasonal flu beforehand had virus only in the respiratory tract — and at pretty low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest take home message of our data is that prior human seasonal virus infection can provide some level of protection against the lethality of bird flu,” said Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist at Emory University in Atlanta and one of the study’s researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webby, the St. Jude researcher, said the work supports other research that has looked at the potential protectiveness of prior exposure to flu viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is for sure playing some role in modulating H5N1 disease in humans,” he said, but was unlikely the only factor. “After all, many people have severe seasonal H1N1 infections each year despite lots of immunity to the virus from previous H1N1 exposures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the finding may help explain why the virus recently has been associated with generally mild disease in the people who have been infected. Seventy people in the U.S. have been infected since March 2024, and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-06/first-us-h5n1-bird-flu-death"&gt;one person has died.&lt;/a&gt; (Four people, including the Louisiana patient who died, have been hospitalized).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before last year, the virus was thought to have killed roughly 50% of those infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen said the worry now is that if H5N1 mutates to become transmissible between people, it’ll be young children as well as the old and compromised who are likely to be most affected. Children younger than 5 are less likely to have been exposed to seasonal human influenza viruses than school-aged children and adults — potentially making them more susceptible to the harms of a virus such as H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she said, the bird flu viruses circulating in birds and livestock “as far as we know, can’t transmit easily between people. But, if there’s reassortment, then who knows? We don’t know what kind of residual population-level immunity we would have” from a virus such as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How seasonal flu vaccines could affect this protection isn’t clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seasonal vaccines will not provide the same diversity of immune response as natural infection and unlikely to provide the same level of protection,” said Lakdawala, who is testing this issue in the lab.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQNXJORGE4b1BmMklOMjhnMVo0Vzk0UG1hRV9RdjNRQXZQcGpMbURGZlpyY1BtUGFQMG9IdXhnV1RmdGZYVm5LMUd3NkJRUmJWYXk0UTQ3YmNnWkxJNDdmNFFsZS12NG9zWHItZjJ5WGZSRm5fbWZ3eWdOWlJjTGpqQ3JHTE1lTUJnX1lYaUxXbi00SGJUOEJFYVg2bGVPNWtUdURTUVhLVkRxeTZtX1dEc2FRNk94b29nbi1NNGtR</guid></item><item><title>Help!

It started with her participating in Dry January and me deciding not to. Neither of us drinks that much, I didn’t feel the need to examine my relationship with alcohol or feel the effects of abstaining from it as I have unconsciously gone more than a month without drinking alcohol before. Even though I morally supported her, I did not go out of my way to shield her from alcohol (she is not going through an addiction recovery program after all—she is a 33-year-old challenging herself).&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exzu0s00323b73jxhibsj3@published"&gt;The whole month she would get upset if I had a glass of wine with dinner or wanted to go to lunch at our favorite brewery, which has a lot of nonalcoholic options and which she typically doesn’t even order alcoholic drinks when we go. Even me choosing brunch at the place with the “best Blood Mary in town” (her words) was seen as me not being supportive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0i001u3b73bi7t5s1u@published"&gt;It has now evolved into me not supporting her fitness journey because I won’t participate in the things she does or diet. I don’t believe in diets. I was a wrestler in my youth and had a messed up relationship with food. I have since learned to eat and exercise in moderation and to enjoy both things. I support her goals—I encourage her, ask her about how her training is going, or how she’s liking various exercise classes or strength training sessions but I don’t want to join her in them. Apparently, by not wanting to go on a strenuous hike on a Sunday afternoon I’m being unsupportive. I was fine going on an easy to moderate hike but she wants to turn everything into a workout. I picked up Chipotle for us the other day and got her the healthy bowl option that she wanted but I was being “unsupportive” because I got my usual with extra guac and sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;

But what if I don’t want to go to a hot yoga class (why is all yoga heated these days?!), or if I’d rather read a book than go on a walk after dinner every evening? How can I explain to her that being supportive doesn’t actually mean participating?&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to me that your girlfriend is confusing “being supportive” with “adjusting your behaviors to match mine exactly.” That’s a pretty controlling mindset. If she’s unable to tolerate your status as an independent person who is allowed to make lifestyle choices that are different from hers—and if she treats every one of your aberrant choices as a direct affront to hers—then I’m not sure there’s much of a future in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0l001z3b735gdgx401@published"&gt;Tell your girlfriend that if she needs a partner whose lifestyle will match hers exactly, she may have to start looking for a new partner. A healthy relationship often pushes us to change our habits, but the desire has to be mutual, and these expectations still need to take everyone’s preferences and sensitivities into consideration. One person does not get to call all of the shots; in this situation, being accused of being “unsupportive” sounds a lot more like you’re being accused of being “disobedient.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8ewrh0k001n1gm4edtca0bo@published"&gt;My aunt is a doctor. I recently learned that before we were together, my fiancé incessantly messaged her office and wrote negative reviews, all because it didn’t support a therapy that very few doctors support—although apparently specialists to whom my aunt has referred people for other issues do support the therapy in question, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/11/dear-prudie-fiance-harassed-aunt-negative-reviews.html"&gt;which seems to be why my fiancé thought he could get things changed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 17-year-old boy in the Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The teenager was admitted to a hospital in the Netherlands for knee surgery after getting injured while playing soccer. The surgery was successful, but when the patient woke up from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anesthesia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he spoke exclusively in English and insisted "repeatedly" that he was in the U.S. Prior to this incident, he spoke the language only during English class in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not recognize his parents and could not speak or understand spoken Dutch, his native language. According to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-021-03236-z" target="_blank" data-url="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-021-03236-z" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report doctors wrote about his case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the patient had no history of psychiatric symptoms and no relevant medical family history, apart from some instances of depression on his mother's side of the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; The nurse who initially noticed the patient speaking English was not immediately worried by it, thinking the teen was experiencing&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7714637/#:~:text=Emergence%20delirium%20(ED)%20is%20an,behavior%20%5B8%2C12%5D." target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7714637/#:~:text=Emergence%20delirium%20(ED)%20is%20an,behavior%20%5B8%2C12%5D." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;emergence delirium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a state of confusion that can occur during recovery from anesthesia. However, when medical staff still could not get the patient to speak a single word of Dutch a few hours later, they called for a psychiatric consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/can-you-forget-your-native-language" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/can-you-forget-your-native-language"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you forget your native language?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychiatric team found the patient relaxed and attentive. He was able to answer questions, albeit in English spoken with a Dutch accent. Later on, he started to give short answers in Dutch but found it difficult to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The 17-year-old was diagnosed with foreign language syndrome (FLS), which happens when patients suddenly and involuntarily switch to using a second language instead of their native language for a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; A neurologist found no abnormalities during a full neurological examination of the patient. Then, 18 hours after his surgery, the teen was able to understand Dutch but still couldn't speak it. Some of the teen's friends came to visit him the day after his surgery, and suddenly, he was able to understand and speak Dutch again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the teen spontaneously started speaking in his native language again, doctors saw no need to run any neuropsychological tests, electroencephalograms (EEG) or other types of brain scans on him. He was discharged three days post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;FLS is rare, with only &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6185554598107295609&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12991-024-00538-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-after-surgery-a-17-year-old-could-speak-only-a-foreign-language" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12991-024-00538-6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12991-024-00538-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-after-surgery-a-17-year-old-could-speak-only-a-foreign-language" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about nine cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described in medical literature.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In most of these cases, the patient was a white male who switched from their native language to another one they had learned later in life; the patients weren't typically bilingual growing up. The race of the patients in two cases was not documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the case report said FLS is rarely seen in children, and they suspected that they were the first to formally document a case of FLS in an adolescent. In total, they found eight reported cases of FLS that were similar to that of their patient, in which the person affected switched to a completely different language rather than speaking in a way that could be perceived as a foreign accent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what happens in a related condition — &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/italian-womans-rare-foreign-accent-syndrome-caused-her-to-sound-canadian" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/italian-womans-rare-foreign-accent-syndrome-caused-her-to-sound-canadian"&gt;&lt;u&gt;called foreign accent syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — in which people adopt a speech pattern that makes it sound like they're speaking with an accent. The rare condition has often, but not always, been seen in the context of brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly why FLS happens is unknown, although there have been other cases in which the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39216510/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39216510/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;syndrome emerges after anesthesia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The case report authors noted that an anesthetic's effects on cognition, as well as the clearance of anesthetic drugs from the central nervous system, can lead to emergence delirium. For that reason, they're not sure if FLS can be classified as a distinct condition or merely a variation of emergence delirium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP-MYwcVa3wTQxHK54UMjbvpqgWJCwrpZ9k" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP-MYwcVa3wTQxHK54UMjbvpqgWJCwrpZ9k slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It’s also good to have extra copies on hand in case you fall victim to theft,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can keep unpacking Ransone’s luggage in the list below, in addition to seeing the travel recommendations of a couple other physicians, too.

This thorough yet travel-friendly lineup of products and gadgets takes into account every fall, scrape, sprain and cough that you might encounter whether you’re on the beaches of Tahiti or scaling the Rocky Mountains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli cli-listicle listicleCountUp"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;A five-pack of NIOSH-certified N95 masks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ransone cautioned that COVID-19 is still very much a risk in many places, so he always makes sure to pack plenty of protective face masks. These N95 respirator masks come in a convenient resealable travel pack and are made by a Florida-based medical device company. They have also been &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/N95list1-d.html" target="_blank" role="link" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="tested and certified" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9d08ae4b0e9567a99d8a9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/N95list1-d.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="70"&gt;tested and certified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for filtering out at least 95% of airborne particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;An economy pack of hand sanitizers and wipes made just for travel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption-container"&gt;For the same reason listed above, Ransone will also always travel with a germ-busting rotation of sanitizing wipes and liquid. Both of these options are extremely high-rated and trusted options for germ protection in addition to being perfectly packaged for travel. The mini alcohol-based sanitizer bottles come in a pack of eight and there are 10 packs of wipes, with 20 wipes in each pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;A two-pack of pocket-sized strips of duct tape&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ransone, there's not much that he can't fix with duct tape, whether it be used to close wounds or secure splints. That being said, who wants to tote around a huge roll of duct tape around in their suitcase?

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to get stronger, but often, what motivates you changes as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, very few 20-year-olds exercise to maintain their independence but that takes on greater importance in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Hayley Madigan—a trainer, sports scientist and Oner Active athlete—about the best exercises to do if you’re new to exercise and over 65, she suggested focusing on functional everyday movements, like squats and step-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're older and maybe you live on your own, how are you gonna get your shopping bags upstairs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to be able to do step-ups. I want to be able to squat down. I want to be able to deadlift my bag from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And those are all functional movements that are taught in weight training," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no need to start with weights if you're new to strength training. The most important thing is to begin at the appropriate level and gradually increase the difficulty as you get stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZWi8BagHxaMdE2pRSq799T" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZWi8BagHxaMdE2pRSq799T slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help, Madigan has provided options for each exercise so it suits your fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-exercises"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-squat-to-chair"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

Step-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 6-8 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in front of a slightly elevated surface, like a step or weight plate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place one foot on the elevated surface and push through your heel to extend your leg and rise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring your other foot on the elevated surface, then step back down carefully and with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat the move, leading with the opposite foot. Continue, alternating sides with each step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it easier: Lower the elevated surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it harder: Choose a higher surface or hold a weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why step-ups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step-ups are another exercise that targets your glutes, along with your hamstrings and quads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These large muscles support your knee joint, so strengthening them can help you avoid some knee problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Step-ups are a really important one for knee strength and knee health, and also hip health, and that's really important for us as we get older," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to this move is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/lunges-bodyweight-exercises" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/lunges-bodyweight-exercises"&gt;lunges&lt;/a&gt;, but Madigan cautions that this exercise can be tricky if you have sore knees.&lt;/p&gt;

If you do notice you have a dry cough after you start a new medication, it’s important to notify your physician so they can monitor, Addrizzo-Harris said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your cough brings up mucus, this is a sign of what experts call a productive cough. The type of sputum (a mix of mucus and saliva) that you cough up can hint at what’s causing it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Is it clear? Is it … yellow or green? Is it bloody? … Usually the darker the color [and] the thicker the sputum, there’s a lot more inflammatory cells in [it], often white blood cells mixed with bacteria,” Addrizzo-Harris said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you notice the color of your sputum is starting to change color, this could be an early sign of a bacterial infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; If this happens, reach out to your doctor because you may need to start antibiotics, she advised. They can send the sputum to a lab to determine what type of bacteria and other organisms are in it and how to treat it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bronchitis, bacterial bronchitis or bacterial pneumonia are the most common causes of a productive cough. But it could also be due to bronchiectasis (a disease where the airways of the lungs are dilated and aren’t able to clear out sputum as well), c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hronic obstructive pulmonary disease &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(COPD) or lung cancer (although less common).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: damircudic via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;damircudic via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Timing, dryness and other symptoms can all help you determine what kind of cough you're dealing with, according to experts.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you had the cough? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timing is really… [a] key thing to differentiate coughs,” Galiatsatos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; said. One of the first things your doctor will probably ask is, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tell me when this cough began.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Depending on how long a cough has been going on, it can be categorized as acute, subacute or chronic, Seo explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An acute cough is one that comes on suddenly and lasts for less than three weeks. It’s “usually caused by an acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection, allergies or irritant,” she said. But it also could occur if you have chronic conditions like asthma or COPD and your symptoms are exacerbated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have a dry cough with a viral illness and then about 10 days later develop a “heavy, productive” cough, this could be a sign of a bacterial infection, like bronchitis or pneumonia, Addrizzo-Harris said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The airways [can] become compromised [when you have] the flu [or other virus] and the regular bacteria that are living within the lung aren’t … cleared out as well,” she explained. “As they grow, the chance of getting a bacterial [infection is higher].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A subacute cough can last for three to eight weeks. While it can be an exacerbation of an underlying disease, it could also be a post-infectious cough lingering even after a respiratory infection is over, Seo said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The infection [may have] caused some lung damage and the lungs are repairing themselves,” Galiatsatos added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lastly, a cough is generally considered chronic if it lasts for more than eight weeks and could indicate conditions like asthma, COPD, GERD or a more serious lung disease, like lung cancer, Seo said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have other symptoms with the cough? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to timing, any accompanying symptoms can be helpful clues for why you have a cough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, if you have a cough with a stuffy or runny nose, sore throat or body aches, you could very well have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="viral infection" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d2d8dbe4b0180744f7a006" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;viral infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; like a cold, flu or COVID.

This could be a sign of bronchitis, asthma, allergies or other other health conditions, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/15203-wheezing" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d2d8dbe4b0180744f7a006" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/15203-wheezing" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What time of day are you coughing most frequently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s helpful to watch for any patterns of when you’re coughing the most, especially if it develops more gradually, Galiatsatos said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Does your cough come within hours of … going to bed and recently eating a meal? This would clue me in that it could be acid reflux,” he said. “Does your cough wake you up in the middle of the night, like hours into sleep? That tells me maybe that’s a little bit more asthma.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, the frequency (and severity) of a cough also really vary depending on the individual, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For example, the influenza virus may trigger a mild, short-lived cough in a healthy young person, but in an older individual with a weakened immune system … it can lead to a severe, potentially life-threatening cough and illness,” she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So... what’s the best way to treat your cough? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The best management is really trying to understand why you have the cough,” Galiatsatos said. “Treating a cough with a cough suppressant without trying to figure out the underlying cause of it is like just taking pain meds without giving a second thought of why you’re having chest pain, for instance.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should see a doctor promptly if your cough is accompanied by fevers, chills, night sweats, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, chest pain or unintentional weight loss, Seo said.

Whenever I have period cramps, pelvic pain or a stabbing sensation in my thighs I get scared that I will have another ruptured cyst."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her diagnosis in 2023, Nina says everyday life has massively changed for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "Living with endometriosis has changed my life entirely, it's taken away my favourite hobbies such as volleyball and it has placed a huge strain on my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It effects my job and my productivity as there are days when I cannot leave my bed due to the pain. It really scares me that I could lose my job as each month I am absent due to the insufferable pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina says the biggest challenge she has faced since her diagnosis is how endometriosis has effected her fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "I felt like my life fell apart as I had always dreamt of becoming a mum but with endometriosis it is likely that I will struggle to conceive naturally, so the freedom of choosing when I would like to be a mum has been taken away from me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis Action Month is calling for greater awareness towards the chronic condition, Nina believes knowledge of endometriosis is getting better but it can come with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "The diagnosis rate is getting better but it does mean more dedicated nurses within the NHS are needed to help women get the support they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BloodyEndoMidlands is a charity supporting women suffering with endometriosis in the West Midlands region, you can visit their support group Facebook page and website online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="article-body-link" href="http://hellorayo.co.uk/hits-radio/play/" target="_blank"&gt;First for all the latest news from across the UK every hour on Hits Radio on DAB, at hitsradio.co.uk and on the Rayo app.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Rayo</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:32:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxPdzFkS0dPUVhWeHVnTmwyLUNQb0NXRjB1UXc1MEVaWFhFb2IyR1FoazRrbFNsSFlLNklFZmljV3oycldSRUhVX1o2RnRtdTZ3VnNkLXk3R0UwczVLMjhoWWdBbE1UNTRXeGZRd1hPNXVIcjlJWkdROC1rVTA1Yl9wYW45OGlfXzV5ck1JMU13Tk1vOFFVMng4UlZJNl9ydktnYzR5NGtBZkxRenFHYi01OV94VUN5bm4ycHAtbVdOSktEM2NGTlFiZ1J4NnBsT2dYbXNRYlBNQjNwQnA5SEowQmtmVGxkN1p0dFljS2xVUTEyWkUybDBTbXdmVQ</guid></item><item><title>I'm a colon cancer doctor.

This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is also the second most common cause of cancer deaths around the world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Cancer Research UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show that in industrialized countries like the US and UK, early-onset colorectal cancer is increasing by two to four percent every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since the 1990s, cancer statistics have shown that EOCRC (early-onset colorectal cancer) has increased by more than 50 percent, meaning it is the leading cause of cancer death in men and the second-leading cause in women under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is most commonly found in the sigmoid colon, the lowest part of the colon just before the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A survey conducted by the Colorectal Cancer Alliance revealed that young patients with EOCRC often experience changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation, unexplained weight loss, fatigue and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest red flag, however, is blood in the stool, on the toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If blood is bright red, it's 'newer' or came from lower in the digestive tract, such as in the sigmoid colon or rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if it's darker or black, it's 'older' and could have come from higher up in the colon or the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the main reasons colorectal cancer is diagnosed so late or dismissed in young people is these signs could be attributed to more benign and common conditions like hemorrhoids or irritable bowel syndrome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, roughly half of all Americans will have hemorrhoids at least once in their life, and one in 10 will be diagnosed with IBS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although bright red rectal bleeding is commonly associated with hemorrhoids, the rising incidence of EOCRC means that any concerning symptoms in younger individuals should not be dismissed without further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This blood loss can also cause anemia, leading to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Why is there a surge of cases in young people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diets rich in red and processed meats, sedentary behavior, and obesity, are well-documented risk factors for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year a study from Cleveland Clinic's Center for Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer shed some light on why processed meats such as deli ham, hot dogs and burgers can be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13746823/oncologist-discovery-record-colon-cancer-patients.html"&gt;colleague Dr Suneel Kamath&lt;/a&gt; and his team collected plasma samples from 64 patients with colorectal cancer and found young patients had higher levels of compounds called metabolites from red and processed meat in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We think these metabolites help feed cancer cells and hijack normal cells, causing tumors to grow while healthy cells are deprived of the energy they need to function normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also thought to be the case for alcohol.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for obesity, the latest science tells us that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14292265/body-fat-areas-higher-risk-colon-cancer-study.html"&gt;carrying more visceral fat around organs like the colon&lt;/a&gt; may create inflammation, which makes cancer cells more likely to form.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a significant proportion of young patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer do not fit this typical high-risk profile. Many are fit, have healthy diets, and do not exhibit common lifestyle risks like smoking or drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This paradox points to the complexity of environmental exposures contributing to the disease, an active area of research that still comes with many unknowns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concept of the 'exposome' - the total amount of environmental exposures that a person encounters during their lifetime - has emerged as a valuable framework for how genetic predisposition and the environment raise the risk of early-onset cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Teams like ours at the Cleveland Clinic are now trying to figure out which environmental factors contribute to the rise in colorectal cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has already provided theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A review from the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14202563/colon-cancer-explosion-toxins-air-link.html"&gt;University of California San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; of more than 3,000 studies found that microplastics can accumulate in the colon and cause it to produce less mucus, a protective layer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the colon can't produce mucus, the intestinal walls can't protect against contaminants like microplastics and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mucus also lubricates the colon and helps stool pass easily. When stool builds up in the colon, it irritates the colon and inflames the inner lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, much of this territory is still uncharted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Am I at risk?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Besides environmental risk factors that still need to be identified, there are several known inherited conditions that predispose patients to colorectal cancer at a young age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, about 15 to 20 percent of early-onset colorectal cases cases are attributed to hereditary conditions - those passed on through families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of these are related to Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs when genes involved in DNA repair - mismatch repair genes - mutate. This significantly raises the risk of cells in organs like the colon growing out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimates one in 279 Americans has Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;FAP, meanwhile, causes the growth of numerous polyps that almost always lead to early-onset cancer if left untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with a family history of these conditions, genetic testing and early and frequent screening, including colonoscopies, are critical in identifying and preventing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, risk-reducing surgeries, like removing parts or even all of the colon, may be the best prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A family history of colorectal cancer, especially when in a first-degree relative, even without a known hereditary condition, doubles your overall risk, so it's crucial to know your history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A known family history of colorectal cancer may prompt genetic testing and potentially life-saving screening colonoscopies, even if you're younger than 45, the current recommended screening age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;How is colon cancer screened for and diagnosed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer is crucial, as cancers detected in the early stages can often be cured with surgery alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, early-onset colorectal cancer is frequently diagnosed at advanced stages because young people are more likely to ignore their symptoms or not be old enough for regular screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This complicates treatment and lowers survival rates. &lt;span&gt;When addressed early, the chances of successful treatment and cure are significantly higher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news in recent decades has been thanks to screening tools like colonoscopies and at-home stool tests, colon cancer rates are down in people over 65.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alarmingly these important gains were accompanied by a rise in cases and deaths in young people that are still below the age of recommended screening examinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45, though this guideline fails to capture the growing number of patients in their 20s and 30s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At-home stool tests like Cologuard have also become increasingly popular, allowing people to take a sample of their stool and send it off to check for hidden blood for DNA changes, which could be a sign of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if you get a positive stool test, you will likely still be referred for a colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;How is colon cancer treated?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treating young people with colon cancer requires special considerations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since hereditary conditions are more commonly found in young patients with cancer, any patient diagnosed with early-onset colon cancer should undergo genetic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diagnosing genetic conditions like Lynch syndrome or FAP can have significant implications not only for the patient but for their relatives, as it could prevent further cancers in the family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Young patients with metastatic disease - meaning the cancer has spread to other areas - may benefit from aggressive treatment, including surgery to remove the primary tumor in the colon and also potential metastases in the liver or lung, but this must be balanced with a careful, individualized approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychological care is also an essential part of treatment, as cancer at a young age can have profound emotional and social impacts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be very difficult for people who are used to being the primary caregivers in their families, taking care of young children and aging parents, to suddenly require care to be given to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Financial toxicity, which refers to the high costs associated with cancer treatment, is another challenge faced by many young patients who frequently do not have sufficient savings and are dependent on regular paychecks to make ends meet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social work support is crucial in addressing these financial burdens and helping patients navigate the complexities of cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, since some cancer treatments can affect reproductive and sexual health, it is critical for EOCRC patients to discuss their plans for childbearing with their cancer provider and be referred to fertility specialists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike many patients traditionally diagnosed with colon cancer, these patients are focused on expanding their families, and we want to make sure they have every opportunity to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The goal of my team is to optimize the quality of life for cancer survivors and provide ongoing support tailored to their unique needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;What's the takeaway?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset colorectal cancer presents a significant public health challenge, driven by complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preventing and reversing the rise of the disease in young people requires a deeper understanding of these influences and the implementation of personalized screening strategies, particularly for individuals with hereditary risks or a family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial to improving survival, and patients and healthcare providers need to be vigilant to prevent delays in detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment must be tailored to the unique needs of younger patients through a multidisciplinary approach at expert centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As innovative research continues to shed light on the causes of colon cancer in young people, a more comprehensive patient- and population-centered approach will not only improve outcomes but also help reduce the overall impact of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is getting dramatically worse by the day and baffled medical professionals at America's top hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His illness hasn't just affected his body; it has also impacted his mental clarity and decision-making, he and his wife told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dating back to June of last year, he began feeling extremely fatigued almost all the time and had begun developing serious acne on his back. By January, he'd developed the first major sore on his leg, which started out red but soon morphed into a terrifying black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of Wednesday last week, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14491549/new-skin-disease-ravages-father-doctors-warning-pyoderma-gangrenosum.html"&gt;40 to 50 percent of his skin was covered in sores&lt;/a&gt;. In just the last several days, he has developed five more wounds on his stomach, at the top of his right arm, and on the palms of his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first wound in January coincided with a major personality shift, according to Mikkel Becker, his wife of one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that time, he lost $25,000 of her retirement money by purchasing &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tesla/index.html" id="mol-864a33e0-0475-11f0-9899-c9616624572f"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; stock option contracts that went bust after 'Elon sent a tweet,' Ryan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan Becker and his wife Mikkel are pictured with their kids at Disney World. Soon after this, he would get his first skin sore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Dermatologists believe Ryan, 38, has a never-before-seen form of pyoderma gangrenosum, a disorder that typically leaves sores only on the legs. He has developed sores on his arms, back, chest, stomach and even the on the palms of his hands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'January is when Ryan started to do dumb stuff he would never have done, like gambling my retirement [on a risky investment],' said Mikkel, who has a four-month-old baby named Atlas with Ryan. ‘Then that's the day that one of the first sores on his legs showed up.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dermatologists say their best guess is that Ryan, 38, has a never-before-seen form of pyoderma gangrenosum, a disorder that typically leaves sores only on the legs and is treatable with steroid therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But neither is true for Ryan. The sores have spread to nearly every corner of his body and doctors have not been able to find an effective form of treatment for him, even as he reports being in agony for large portions of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said his sores cause him 'burn victim level pain.' She added that nearly all the doctors they've seen have been shocked by his sheer number of ulcers and the severity of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Everywhere we go with Ryan, doctors are in shock, awe and horror. I mean, they can’t hide it on their faces. They're trained to not show any expression, but when they see Ryan, it's just like, “Oh my god,”’ Mikkel said, adding that they often go and get second, third and even fourth opinions from their colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He sought help at the Mayo Clinic in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-4e84a940-047f-11f0-9af9-f5bacadcdf9c"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and a Johns Hopkins-affiliated hospital in Washington, D.C., but still remains without answers he desperately seeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although his prognosis is still unknown — given that pyoderma gangrenosum remains poorly understood by scientists — Johns Hopkins gave Ryan the grim prediction in February that he likely has six months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan said his latest test results have led the heartbroken family to believe that he's going to die 'a slow, painful death.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's no cases that any of the dermatologists that I've talked to that have seen it spread to the legs, the torso and the arms,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan's sores first show up as red marks on his skin. They then get raised and blister before popping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After that, the sores become necrotic, meaning its essentially a mass of dead skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And with each new sore that appears, he goes through the same grueling process each time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So what happens is, they get red, they get raised, they blister, then they pop, then they go necrotic,’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When skin or any other tissue enters a 'necrotic' state, it essentially means that the cells have died due to a lack of blood flow. This is also when the skin turns dark black and almost looks like frost bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Necrosis can be extremely painful and &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection"&gt;presents with symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as a fever, sensations of 'crackling' under the skin, and brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan freely admits that in his case, it has gone far beyond brain fog or just normal confusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though the first sores appeared in early January, it wasn't until early February when Mikkel realized it was time to go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I woke up to him having a seizure in the bed. And I'm trying to stop him from hitting his head on the bed. And his hands are flailing everywhere and he, you know, accidentally punches me in the face,’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this time, he had also developed a chest wound 'in the shape of a heart,' Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan said he doesn’t remember that seizure at all, but Mikkel said he started having them during their family trip to Disney World from December 31 to January 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan Becker is pictured in a hotel room ahead of his visit to the Mayo Clinic with his wife Mikkel and four-month-old baby Atlas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once at the Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, the couple said Ryan was loaded up with a massive cocktail of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say he was given corticosteroids intravenously, a treatment typically given to deal with inflammation. Experts also say that high doses of these types of steroids can lead to psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was definitely in a state of acute psychosis,' Ryan said. ‘I was like, “I must have murdered someone or something” … I thought all the nurses were involved in it, that it was a sting operation, that I was gonna go to sleep, and they were gonna arrest me. But then also, my parents were into organized crime.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel and Ryan both said he believed Mikkel was an FBI agent and that his stepdaughter Reagan was a CIA agent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After that, Ryan said he agreed to be given Dilaudid, an opioid weaker than fentanyl but stronger than morphine, and Haldol, a powerful antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They kept me sleeping, at least I thought they did. Apparently, I sleep-walked,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over the last month, Ryan and Mikkel have been traveling around the country searching for a cure to his unusually aggressive disease. Their baby has been with them every step of the way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said that while she appreciated the doctors' efforts at the hospital in their home city, she fears their treatment was below what was needed given the severity of his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan and Mikkel thought their fortunes had turned around when the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota squeezed them in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to them, their arrival at the world-renowned health facility was the start of an entirely new nightmare when he wasn't taken seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple say doctors began making suggestions that weren't true, and it was briefly believed he was suffering from factitious disorder, better known as Munchausen syndrome, a condition where someone intentionally harms themselves to gain attention or affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They completely stopped treating me,' he said, which he said included heavily reducing his course of painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A resident said, "So we believe you've been using substances... and you're causing these wounds yourself. So, we're going to go ahead and discharge you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm like, "How in the world do you think I'm causing these wounds by scratching myself?"' Ryan recalled saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said they had to jump through a lot of hoops to get the misunderstanding corrected, and their version of events was solidified when Ryan's urine test came back negative for drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan reports having extreme pain from the sores on his body as well as fatigue dating back to June of last year, before he even had any breakouts on his skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also said she had to repeatedly tell doctors that she was with her husband 24/7 and would know if his wounds were self-inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked about Ryan's experiences, the Mayo Clinic declined to comment, citing patient privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two weeks at the Mayo Clinic, the couple along with their baby got on another plane bound for Johns Hopkins Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the hospital, which partners with the National Institute of Health's Undiagnosed Diseases Program, did not believe Ryan had factitious disorder or had a drug problem, the couple said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That much was a comfort, they said, but their trip to Johns Hopkins yielded no more answers to why Ryan's case of pyoderma gangrenosum is so unusually aggressive — or why he is one of the few patients with the disease who could die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's also no indication of what causes his sores to appear, though scientists who have studied the disease suspect it could be autoimmune-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uncertainty that surrounds every aspect of Ryan's fast-progressing disease is what spurred them to travel across the country to the top medical institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That has also had the downside of taking Ryan and Mikkel out of the workforce, which will threaten their access to their employer-sponsored health plans in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To deal with Ryan's ongoing medical bills, the family has set up a GoFundMe that has raised more than $33,000 so far&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan works as a commercial plans examiner for Spokane County. He was originally under the impression that he'd have to return full-time by April 1, otherwise, he'd have to pay roughly $3,000 per month for COBRA coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His job has since worked out a deal with him that it will keep his family's benefits intact through August as long as they contribute to the health plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan doesn't have only himself to worry about. He has six children ranging from a four-month-old son to a 17-year-old daughter who need health coverage too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of possibly losing coverage, he recently received an unexpected medical bill from the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sent Ryan a letter stating that his stay was not covered by his health insurance and that he would be responsible for his remaining balance of $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan is afraid that Johns Hopkins will do the same thing, though he hasn't received any denial of coverage correspondence from them yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far, the family has raised more than $33,000 on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/RyanandKel"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Tuesday night, Ryan and Mikkel were on their way to Portland from their home in Spokane to see one of the world's foremost experts on pyoderma gangrenosum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan and Mikkel are currently on their way to see Dr. Alex Ortega-Loayza (pictured) who is one of the world's foremost experts on pyoderma gangrenosum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Alex Ortega-Loayza is a dermatologist at the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University Hospital, where he assembled a team of scientists, biostatisticians, and clinicians to specifically study pyoderma gangrenosum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan is scheduled to see Dr. Ortega this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, Ryan and Mikkel haven't lost their optimism or sense of humor, with the couple joking that he has 'zombie skin,' a fear he eerily predicted on his Bumble profile back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think we met on Bumble, right? He had on there, what's your greatest fear?’ Mikkel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And he said,’ Mikkel started before Ryan interjected, ‘to have a condition that causes a zombie apocalypse to be named after me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now he's like, “Oh my God, my skin is like zombie skin now!”’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microbes feed on what you eat, which is why your nutrition can play a crucial role in maintaining a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/how-to-heal-your-gut-8769420" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut&lt;/a&gt; microbiome.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consuming foods that nourish beneficial bacteria helps them grow and function. This also limits the food available for harmful bacteria, which helps to curb their growth.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber comes in two types: soluble and insoluble. The bacteria in your gut break down soluble fiber, producing beneficial compounds and gases. Insoluble fiber doesn't dissolve in water, but it helps soften stool and adds bulk, making it easier for food to move through your digestive system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When Catalonian &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Branyas"&gt;Maria Branyas&lt;/a&gt; died in August 2024 at the grand old age of 117 years and 168 days, she was officially the world's oldest living person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine how Maria managed to collect so many birthdays, a team led by researchers from the Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute in Spain conducted a comprehensive analysis on everything from her genes to her proteins to her microbiome to her metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their report, which is yet to be peer reviewed, provides a rare glimpse into the cellular machinery that just might give some of us a shot at starting a second centenary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155484" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642.jpg" alt="Maria at her 117th birthday" class="wp-image-155484 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155484" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maria blowing out candles at her 117th birthday.

Only around 1 in 10 of the people who make it to a century of living then manage another decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a host of different analytical techniques and interviews, the researchers found that Maria checked a lot of the recommended boxes when it came to longevity and healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155398" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155398" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart.jpg" alt="Multiomics chart" class="wp-image-155398 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart-416x415.jpg 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart-600x598.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155398" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at multiple signs of aging. (Santos-Pujol et al., &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a mentally, socially, and physically active lifestyle, for instance, spending quality time with family and friends; all factors known to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;keep dementia at bay&lt;/a&gt;. Maria also ate well, sticking mostly to a Mediterranean-style diet that's been linked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;to a longer lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the researchers noted was Maria's love of yogurt. The researchers think the supercentenarian's diet choices helped to encourage healthy gut bacteria – and indeed her gut microbiome had the characteristics of someone much younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microorganisms are critical in determining not only the metabolite composition of our body, but also inflammation, intestinal permeability, cognition, and bone and muscle health," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations in our DNA have long been considered critical in determining our mortality. Maria had genes associated with a stronger immune system, protection against heart disease, and a reduction in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-risk-of-cancer-could-fluctuate-even-born-youre-born"&gt;risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;; a chemical marking mechanism that affects how genes are expressed. Since this mechanism is influenced by stresses in the environment, it is often used to gauge the passing of life's trials in what's described as our biological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Remarkably, all the distinct algorithms of age based on DNA methylation yielded the same result," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our supercentenarian exhibited a much younger biological age than her real chronological age and this occurred in the three different tissues analyzed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors highlighted by the researchers were Maria's highly efficient metabolism, leading to lower levels &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-reveal-how-to-actually-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;of 'bad' cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and higher levels of 'good' cholesterol, as well as low levels of inflammation (protecting against multiple health issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20250310/genetico-maria-branyas-117-anos-microbiota-nina/16484198.shtml"&gt;Maria herself&lt;/a&gt; put her long life down to an "orderly life and pleasant surroundings", but it's clear that there were multiple factors at work. While most of us won't reach 117, the research does help in understanding how the body can be given the best chance of aging without damage or disease – and from there improving our health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The picture that emerges from our study shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but is available on the preprint server &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;BioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"For as long as I can remember, every time I pee, my eyes tear up. I don’t mean just a little watery-eyed moment, I mean full-blown tears streaming down my face, sometimes even a runny nose. The longer I hold it, the worse it gets. I always assumed this happened to everyone. Growing up without the internet, there wasn’t exactly a way to fact-check my experience, and honestly, it never even crossed my mind to ask my family about it. It was just…normal. Then, one fateful day in high school, I hadn’t adjusted to my new schedule yet, so I went for two full class periods without a bathroom break. By the time I finally made it to the restroom, the floodgates (both kinds) opened. When I walked back into class, my friends looked alarmed."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“'Are you okay? Why were you crying?' one of them asked. Confused, I just shrugged. 'Oh, I wasn’t crying. I just really had to pee.' Apparently, this wasn’t a universal experience. No one in my friend group had any idea what I was talking about. In fact, they didn’t even believe me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and thanks to the internet, I now know this rare phenomenon is called Gustatory Lacrimation. It’s a quirky little glitch in the nervous system where the body gets its wires crossed, making my tear ducts go into overdrive when I relieve myself. If that’s not a completely useless superpower, I don’t know what is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;

Basically, I can feel certain sounds in different parts of my body. For example, thunder feels like being kicked in the spine, and rustling paper or bags feels like someone running their fingers all over my back and chest. I love music because some songs feel like I'm being tickled or getting a massage.

Every time. The first time I was under anesthesia, I was like 8 and getting stitches in my head. The doctor took a step back and was like, 'Oh gosh, you’re awake!' I felt him sewing my head back together and snip the stitches. It didn’t hurt, but it was itchy as crud. I also had jaw surgery when I was 13, and I woke up alone in a chair and dragged myself down the hallway until a nurse found me and helped me back to my room to sleep off the remainder of the anesthesia."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cornynugget234" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cornynugget234;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cornynugget234&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I have experienced two very unusual brain-related conditions.

Basically, I was experiencing things around me, and myself, growing and shrinking in size. It was more than visual — it was like I knew the sizes were changing. Sometimes it was accompanied by sounds. I didn't tell anyone about it until I was an adult, because I had no idea how to explain it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Henrik Sorensen / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Then, starting at some point in early adulthood, I started experiencing something called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fangelicaamartinez%2Funusual-body-things-2025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F21907-exploding-head-syndrome-ehs&amp;amp;xcust=7844528%7C0%7CRSS%7C0&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exploding Head Syndrome;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Exploding Head Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. (Why do both of these have the coolest-sounding names, btw?) When this happened, I would hear something like a loud explosion, which would wake me up. Upon asking others about it, there was no noise. Other times it manifests as hearing someone yelling my name, which wakes me up, too.

The sleep-drinking was the most problematic, because I've woken up drinking acetone, windex, and contact solution before. My brother did these, too, and my dad was notorious for eating a sleeve of Oreos while asleep. So, I thought it was normal. Over the last year, it's gotten WILD. One time, I made full-blown oven nachos with chopped vegetables. I fed them to my mom at 3 a.m. while dead asleep. I only woke up when I started talking about a school bus, and she realized what was happening."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The sleepwalking is worse when I'm stressed.

I have also seen it described as lacking a 'mind's eye.' Anyway, after hearing about it, I realized I have it. I had no idea. The fact that I can’t visualize images wasn’t something I had ever consciously thought about, but my mind is blown that when other people think about something they can vividly see it in their mind!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;15.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I can't hear anything while underwater, which I learned is apparently not normal. My friends were talking about how water transmits sound, and I asked how they could tell, because when I'm underwater, it sounds like I'm inside a jet engine — a loud, deafening roaring all around me. Turns out my eardrum was damaged/punctured when I was younger, and I never knew."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Greg Finnegan / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lacjiba" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lacjiba;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lacjiba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;16.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I thought everyone dislocated their joints on a regular basis until I did physical therapy and my provider told me that it was NOT normal. Apparently, I have loose joints. For as long as I can remember, I could always dislocate my big toes, thumbs, hips, and ribs. It hurts like hell, but I'd just pop them back in and move on with my day. I started asking friends and family if that happened to them too, and they looked at me like I was insane."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sarahp472e09325" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sarahp472e09325;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sarahp472e09325&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;17.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"For as long as I can remember, every time I pee, my eyes tear up. I don’t mean just a little watery-eyed moment, I mean full-blown tears streaming down my face, sometimes even a runny nose. The longer I hold it, the worse it gets. I always assumed this happened to everyone. Growing up without the internet, there wasn’t exactly a way to fact-check my experience, and honestly, it never even crossed my mind to ask my family about it. It was just…normal. Then, one fateful day in high school, I hadn’t adjusted to my new schedule yet, so I went for two full class periods without a bathroom break. By the time I finally made it to the restroom, the floodgates (both kinds) opened. When I walked back into class, my friends looked alarmed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“'Are you okay? Why were you crying?' one of them asked. Confused, I just shrugged. 'Oh, I wasn’t crying. I just really had to pee.' Apparently, this wasn’t a universal experience. No one in my friend group had any idea what I was talking about. In fact, they didn’t even believe me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fast forward to today, and thanks to the internet, I now know this rare phenomenon is called Gustatory Lacrimation. It’s a quirky little glitch in the nervous system where the body gets its wires crossed, making my tear ducts go into overdrive when I relieve myself. If that’s not a completely useless superpower, I don’t know what is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;18.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I didn't know I had flat feet until I was 16 or 17 years old.

I would always get frustrated because I was never sure if I was doing the exam correctly, but any attempts at clarifying the situation went nowhere. Fast forward a couple of decades, and I was listening to a podcast where the host was interviewing an optometrist about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fangelicaamartinez%2Funusual-body-things-2025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.optometrists.org%2Fgeneral-practice-optometry%2Fguide-to-binocular-visual-dysfunction%2Fwhat-is-vertical-heterophoria-signs-and-treatment%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DVertical%2520heterophoria%2520(VH)%2520is%2520a%2Cresulting%2520in%2520serious%2520vision%2520problems.&amp;amp;xcust=7844528%7C0%7CRSS%7C60038586&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vertical heterophoria;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;vertical heterophoria&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Joey Ingelhart / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It was fascinating to hear that all these weird, random things I never thought twice about could be related and could be impacting my life negatively. I took an online quiz on that optometrist’s website, and she personally called me back a couple of days later. The weird dry feeling I get in large public spaces? Drifting into someone that I’m walking next to? Yep, didn’t realize people don’t normally do that. Aching eyeballs? Closing one eye to read? Neck pain because my head is always tilted? Every single one was a yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then, the doctor asked if I had double vision. I said no, just the normal kind that happens when I rest my eyes. She paused for a beat then told me double vision isn’t normal. I reassured her that it wasn’t actual double vision, just the normal double vision that everyone has when they unfocus and relax their eyes. That's when she diagnosed my vertical heterophoria, which is a type of binocular vision disorder where my eyes don’t align properly. I was prescribed prism glasses and was blown away when my headache, motion sickness, head tilt, neck pain, anxiety in open spaces, headaches, eye strain, and double vision went away immediately. Eye teaming issues are not screened for in standard vision exams, so binocular vision disorders are commonly missed. If I had not happened across that podcast, I doubt I would have ever realized there was an issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Jess, 44&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;28.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I thought all periods were just really bad. I thought it was normal to vomit and pass out purely from pain. Turns out it wasn’t, I have extreme hormone levels. I found out it wasn’t normal when after passing out for the third time in school. My school nurse told me he didn’t get periods, but even he knew this wasn’t normal. I’m currently on a treatment plan that involves birth control, and life is so much better.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brazil's bats are harboring a vast and diverse pool of coronaviruses, a new study finds, including a newly identified strain that may pose a danger to human health in the years to come.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists are taking the threat seriously and will soon conduct testing in a secure lab to see if the variant really could spill over to our own species.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The discovery is cause for concern because the strain is eerily reminiscent of the bat-borne virus behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) – a contagion that causes a very high case fatality rate of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8930171/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;nearly 35 percent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its identification in 2012, the MERS  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="155291" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; (MERS-CoV) has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers"&gt;caused 858 known deaths&lt;/a&gt;, mostly in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. While mild cases are likely underreported, this  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="155291" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; holds the&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_839_21"&gt; highest case fatality rate&lt;/a&gt; of all the known coronaviruses that can infect humans, making it the most lethal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For comparison, the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS‑CoV‑2, has a human case fatality rate of around 2 percent, according to a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_839_21"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155419" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155419" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-642x856.jpg" alt="Close Relative of Most Lethal Coronavirus Found in Brazil's Bats" class="wp-image-155419 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-642x856.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-311x415.jpg 311w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held-600x800.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/Great_fruit-eating_bat_held.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155419" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The great fruit-eating bat (&lt;em&gt;Artibeus lituratus&lt;/em&gt;) can harbor the new MERS-like virus. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Great_fruit-eating_bat_held.jpg"&gt;Juan Cruzado Cortés/Wikimedia Commons/CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists in Brazil and China discovered the close relative of MERS-CoV while testing 16 different bat species in Brazil for pathogens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking more than 400 oral and rectal swabs from bats, the international team, led by Bruna Stefanie Silvério from the Federal University of São Paulo, identified seven distinct coronaviruses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;These were harbored by just two species: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvety_free-tailed_bat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molossus molossus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (an insect-eater) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_fruit-eating_bat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artibeus lituratus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a fruit bat).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Only one of the viral variants shares an evolutionary history with MERS-CoV.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Until now, members of the MERS-CoV family had only been documented in bats of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/10/13-0946_article"&gt;Africa, Europe, and the Middle East&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This indicates that "closely related viruses are circulating in South American bats and expanding their known geographic range," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;according to the authors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Silvério et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists have known that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-018-0118-9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;viruses found in bats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are a threat to human safety since long before the 2020 pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, became the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-70962-6_13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;first pandemic transmissible disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the 21st century to have an unknown origin. The fatality ratio of this viral outbreak reached &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1843.2003.00518.x"&gt;around 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the epidemic in June 2003.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Later, researchers figured out that bats were a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/research/health-medical/diseases/infectious-diseases/bats-confirmed-host-of-sars-virus"&gt;&lt;span&gt;natural reservoir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for SARS-like coronaviruses, and after years of hard work, they confirmed that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1118391"&gt;SARS-CoV-1 spilled over&lt;/a&gt; from these wild mammals to ourselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2012, yet &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/man-tests-positive-for-mers-cov-in-abu-dhabi-who-reports"&gt;&lt;span&gt;another deadly coronavirus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; appeared on the scene. The MERS coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia after most likely jumping from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000342"&gt;bats to camels&lt;/a&gt; to humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While this virus spreads less easily among our own species, travelers have carried the infection to the United States, Europe, Africa, and Asia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of a MERS-like strain in South America underscores the "&lt;span&gt;critical role bats play as reservoirs for emerging viruses," &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Silvério and her team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Right now we aren't sure it can infect humans, but we detected parts of the virus's spike protein [which binds to mammalian cells to start an infection] suggesting potential interaction with the receptor used by MERS-CoV," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076849"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Silvério. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To find out more, we plan to conduct experiments in Hong Kong during the current year."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since 2020, the world has taken the threat of coronaviruses spilling over from wild mammals to humans &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-covid-like-virus-in-russian-bats-shows-resistance-to-vaccine-antibodies"&gt;&lt;span&gt;more seriously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; than ever before. The discovery of a threatening bat-borne virus in South America is certainly concerning, but it's also a point of comfort. Now that we know it exists, scientists can keep a close eye on the threat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Bats are important viral reservoirs and should therefore be submitted to continuous epidemiological surveillance," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1076849"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; co-author Ricardo Durães-Carvalho, biologist at the Federal University of São Paulo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better the devil you know than the one you don't.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.70173"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of Medical Virology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But don’t forget balance exercises to reduce your chance of falls - The Conversation Canada</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5wFBVV95cUxNWjl1SnU1cl9yenp1TFNwTzBLRU9zOFBrWEY4cTZ5VlBWZ2x1V252OGZHQ0lRakgtY2x3UExsOVVtcFZKNkRhQzNUSG5xSi15UF9fUFh1NnZnQzNVVzdKNGdqS2M1OUVDaUJlOGtIeXc0NXRXR002b3hhVy1xYWFsOHZMMDJVVXMzTm9BazEwY250ZzVwN24wQ3AwYVQxQ1F2d0NDOFo2SXlWa1VpN1ZzeW5SLXNXVW5DM3lFdVB3d2RScjRnWDVnR0RwajcyMEQzSFZ4NmV2WU5CakdwOElqSjdhSkwwRE0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We all recognise the benefits of regular aerobic or cardiovascular exercise to support our heart and lung health. Being active is also good for our social and mental health. And strength training promotes &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-022-01675-2"&gt;strong bones and muscles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as we age, we also need to train our balance to avoid falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a href="https://www.cec.health.nsw.gov.au/keep-patients-safe/older-persons-patient-safety-program/fall-prevention#:%7E:text=More%20than%20one%20in%20three,incidents%20in%20hospital%20are%20high."&gt;one in three&lt;/a&gt; people aged 65 and over have a fall each year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-of-health/safety-and-mobility/step-safely"&gt;Falls&lt;/a&gt; are a common cause of disability and loss of independence in older age and can lead to an older person moving from living independently into living in a residential aged care facility. More than &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/injury/falls"&gt;6,000 older Australians die&lt;/a&gt; each year from falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many falls &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012424.pub2/full"&gt;are preventable&lt;/a&gt;. So exercise that targets balance and strength is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How much do we need to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bgs.org.uk/policy-and-media/landmark-publication-of-world-falls-guidelines-0"&gt;International guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend all older people exercise to prevent falls, even if they’ve never fallen. Prevention is far better than cure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015128"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend people aged 65 and over do “functional balance and strength training” on three or more days a week, to improve their ability to do day-to-day activities, stay independent, and prevent falls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since balance starts to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/72/4/572/2629941"&gt;decline&lt;/a&gt; at around age 50, it’s even better to start training balance before the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to increase our muscle strength, we need to progressively lift heavier weights. Similarly, to boost our balance, we need to practise activities that progressively challenge it. This improves our ability to stay steady in difficult situations and avoid falling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional training means doing a physical activity that imitates everyday activities, such as standing up out of a chair, or stepping onto a step. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you practise the everyday activities necessary for living independently, you improve your ability to perform them. This reduces the likelihood of falling when doing those activities, and therefore helps you maintain your independence for longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What exercises can you do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best exercises to challenge our balance system and reduce the risk of falling are performed while standing, rather than seated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can stand with your feet close together or on one leg (if it’s safe to do so) while also performing controlled upper-body movements, such as leaning and reaching. This is a functional balance exercise and it can be made progressively more challenging as your balance improves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some &lt;a href="https://www.safeexerciseathome.org.au/"&gt;exercises&lt;/a&gt; you can practise at home:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sit to stand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practise standing up from a seated position ten times every hour or so. See if you can do it without using your arms for support. To increase the balance challenge, place a cushion under the feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heel-raises&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rise up onto your toes and hold the position for a few seconds. Hold on to a bench or wall for support if you need to but gradually remove the support as your balance improves. To increase the balance challenge, try doing this with your eyes closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;You can make heel-raises progressively harder.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/female-standing-on-toes-doing-foot-1160421631"&gt;Mary Rice/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heel-toe walking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practise walking along an imaginary line, with one foot placed in front of the other. Hold on to a bench or wall for support if you need to but gradually remove the support as your balance improves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stepping in different directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practise quickly stepping forwards, sideways and backwards. Being able to move our feet quickly can help avoid a fall if you trip on something. If you are able, more challenging activities include stepping up or jumping onto a box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squats and lunges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Squats and lunges improve balance and leg strength. Add some hand weights to increase the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Squats improve balance and leg strength.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/selective-focus-senior-multiethnic-sportspeople-synchronous-1272152989"&gt;LightField Studios/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples and others can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.safeexerciseathome.org.au/"&gt;Safe Exercise at Home website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Make it regular – and tailor it to your needs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important that balance challenging exercises are performed regularly, at least three times per week. The benefits of exercise are lost if you stop doing them, so ongoing practice is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People of all abilities can safely undertake balance training exercise, however extra guidance and support is recommended for people who have physical limitations, are frail, or who are at a higher risk of falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For younger or fitter people, agility activities such as rapid stepping, dancing and running are likely to improve co-ordination and balance too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you are carrying out your exercise routine, ask yourself: what am I doing to improve my balance? Investing in balance training now can help you avoid falls, and lead to greater independence in older age.&lt;/p&gt;

										&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Tuolumne County, CA—Tuolumne County Public Health (TCPH) is warning the public that it is investigating two suspected cases of measles involving Summerville High School and Adventist Health Sonora (AHS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department cautions the public about potential exposure for anyone at the campus between Monday, March 10, and Tuesday, March 11, 2025, and at the hospital’s emergency room between the late evening of Saturday, March 15, and the early morning of Sunday, March 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is an emerging situation; details are pending, and we will update the public as soon as further information is available,” stated health officials, adding, “As part of the investigation, Summerville High School is coordinating closely with public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Summerville Union High School District takes the health and safety of its students, staff, and our community seriously, and we will be working closely with Tuolumne County Public Health through the process of identifying any risk to our students, staff and community,” states Michael Merrill, superintendent of Summerville High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/local/3645030/safeguarding-against-measles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;As we reported here last week, California had five confirmed measles cases,&lt;/a&gt; and county health put out an alert to the public advising on the best way to protect against the highly infectious disease. In today’s press release they advise that exposed individuals should monitor for symptoms and confirm if their measles vaccination is up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unimmunized persons or those with unknown immunization status who were at these locations during the aforementioned dates and times are at risk of developing measles from 7 to 21 days after being exposed and should monitor for symptoms,” shared health officials, adding, “Exposed individuals who have been free of symptoms for more than 21 days after exposure are no longer at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH provided this list of what exposed individuals should do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles. People who have not had a measles infection or received the measles immunization previously may not be protected from the measles virus and should talk with a healthcare provider about receiving the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) or Proquad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash from 7 days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• If symptoms develop, they should isolate at home and avoid contact with others. Talk to their healthcare provider. Call ahead of their visit to a healthcare facility and make them aware of their measles exposure and symptoms. Public health can assist healthcare providers in appropriately diagnosing and managing your care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An infected person can spread measles up to four days before a rash appears and up to four days after the rash appears. Measles is an airborne illness that can infect others when an infected person breathes, talks, coughs, or sneezes. Health officials stress that the virus can stay in the air and on surfaces for many hours, even after the infected person has left. If others breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth, they can become infected. Young children and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for life-threatening complications from infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCPH provided these common symptoms of measles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• High fever (higher than 101°F)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Cough&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Runny nose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Red and watery eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness. The “measles rash” typically starts at the face and then spreads down to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most health insurance covers the cost of vaccines, according to TCPH, noting that being vaccinated against measles, mumps, and rubella with the MMR or MMRV vaccines is the strongest defense against this disease. The MMRV also guards against varicella or chickenpox. If taken in two doses, they are 97 percent effective. That drops to 93 percent if just one dose is taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If 95% of the population has received both doses of the vaccine, the transmission of measles within the community can be stopped,” stress TCPH officials.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;EVERETT — A Snohomish County adult has been identified with measles, the health departments from King and Snohomish Counties announced Tuesday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case of measles, the second confirmed in the state this year, was identified Monday. The first case of measles was confirmed in an infant on Feb. 26 in King County.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health departments in King and Snohomish County assessed potential public exposures while the individual was contagious and found there is no risk of measles to the general public from the latest case, the departments announced in a release Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without the rapid response from public health departments to conduct contact tracing to identify susceptible individuals, we could have seen significantly more cases,” Snohomish County Health Officer James Lewis wrote in a release.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that causes fever, rash, coughing, a runny nose and watery eyes. If one person has it, up to 90% of people nearby will be infected without protection, the departments wrote. Measles spreads through the air after an infected person coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-34-12208276" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-34-12208276" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure, the departments said. It is contagious from about four days before the rash appears through four days after it appears.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank"&gt;Once a widespread and ubiquitous disease&lt;/a&gt; that infected 3 to 4 million people per year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the implementation of a measles, mumps and rubella &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; largely eliminated measles in the United States by 2000. But annual cases have increased since 2024, CDC data shows. A total of 301 confirmed cases have been confirmed nationwide as of March 19, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;. Ninety-five percent of those cases are in people who are unvaccinated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those at the highest risk of complications from measles include infants and children under 5 years old, adults over 20 years old, pregnant people and people who are immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-35-25304453" data-insertion-position="prepend" data-selector=".ai-insert-35-25304453" data-insertion-no-dbg data-code="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" data-block="35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella, vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles and the protection is long-lasting, the departments said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there are some prevention steps like immune globulin and the MMR vaccine that can prevent infection when given promptly after exposure, supplements like vitamin A, cod liver oil, or other alternative remedies will not stop measles from spreading.” Lewis wrote. “Measles exposure in the community puts vulnerable people—especially infants, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems—at serious risk. Measles is highly contagious, but also highly preventable with vaccination, and ensuring people are fully immunized remains our best defense.”

Health departments in King and Snohomish counties have assessed potential public exposures and determined there is no risk to the general public, according to Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Lewis, Health Officer for the Snohomish County Health Department, emphasized the importance of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/snohomish-county-health-department-confirmed-measles-case-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-exposure-symptoms-king-county-public-health-schd" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/snohomish-county-health-department-confirmed-measles-case-seattle-tacoma-international-airport-exposure-symptoms-king-county-public-health-schd" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;2 cases of measles exposure confirmed in Snohomish County&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Measles spreads easily in communities with low immunity, which is why maintaining high vaccination rates is so critical," Lewis said. "We have confirmed a second measles case; without the rapid response from public health departments to conduct contact tracing to identify susceptible individuals, we could have seen significantly more cases.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eric Chow, Communicable Disease Chief for Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County, highlighted the seriousness of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Measles is more than just a rash and can be a very serious infection that affects different parts of the body. It’s hard to watch a loved one experience an illness due to measles," Chow said. "Unfortunately, measles is very contagious and people who are not fully vaccinated are at risk.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe complications, including ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and, in rare cases, encephalitis or death.

(KATU) — &lt;/span&gt;Seattle, King County and the Snohomish County public health officials are investigating a second confirmed case of measles in Washington state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, identified on March 17, 2025, involves an adult resident of Snohomish County and is linked to a previous case reported in late February in King County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington health officials have determined there is no risk of measles to the general public from this new case. The individual was likely exposed at a location visited by the first case while contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles manifests in a cough, fever, runny nose, watery eyes, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549793/" target="_blank" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549793/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Koplik spots&lt;/a&gt; and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still zero reported cases of measles in Oregon for this year, but this can change quickly. Oregon Health Authority (OHA) encouraged people to make sure they are protected against measles as 12 states including California, Texas and New Mexico, have reported measles cases since Jan. 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Oregon recorded 31 confirmed cases, its highest measles count in more than 30 years, during an outbreak among unvaccinated people, including two children younger than 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; has reported 301 cases. 279 confirmed cases of measles have been reported in Texas, 33 in New Mexico, five in California, two in Alaska and Pennsylvania, one case in Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Vermont, and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is an amazingly contagious virus that unfortunately in recent years has re-emerged in our communities, primarily due to a declining percentage of people who are getting vaccinated,” said Paul Cieslak, M.D., medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at OHA’s Public Health Division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection for individuals who haven’t received immunity through the MMR vaccine,” said Dawn Nolt, M.D., M.P.H., professor of pediatrics (infectious diseases) in the OHSU School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ ALSO: &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/senators-urge-hhs-to-launch-national-measles-vaccination-campaign-merkley-wyden-oregon#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Senators urge HHS to launch national measles vaccination campaign amid outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. James Lewis, Health Officer for the Snohomish County Health Department, emphasized the importance of vaccination. "Measles spreads easily in communities with low immunity, which is why maintaining high vaccination rates is so critical," he said. "We have confirmed a second measles case; without the rapid response from public health departments to conduct contact tracing to identify susceptible individuals, we could have seen significantly more cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, and is known to cause a dangerous and unique phenomenon called "&lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" target="_blank" title="https://asm.org/articles/2019/may/measles-and-immune-amnesia" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;immune amnesia&lt;/a&gt;," in which the infected patient's immune system goes through a reset, effectively "forgetting" any immunity it had towards other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ ALSO: &lt;a href="https://katu.com/news/local/king-county-baby-diagnosed-with-measles-multiple-public-exposure-sites-identified-vaccine-vaxx-rfk-disease-immunity-danger-children-health-hospital-emergency-seattle-washington-apple-iphone-pediatric-allergy#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/king-county-baby-diagnosed-with-measles-multiple-public-exposure-sites-identified-vaccine-vaxx-rfk-disease-immunity-danger-children-health-hospital-emergency-seattle-washington-apple-iphone-pediatric-allergy#" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;King County infant diagnosed with measles; multiple public exposure sites identified&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicable Disease Chief for Public Health  for Seattle &amp;amp; King County Dr. Eric Chow, highlighted the seriousness of measles. "Measles is more than just a rash and can be a very serious infection that affects different parts of the body. It’s hard to watch a loved one experience an illness due to measles," he said. "Unfortunately, measles is very contagious and people who are not fully vaccinated are at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to severe complications, including ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and, in rare cases, encephalitis or death. The disease is preventable with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is about 97% effective with two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, OHA bolstered its tracking of communicable diseases, such as measles, with the development of data reporting tools such as this interactive &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.public.health.division.acute.and.communicable.disease.pre/viz/shared/6ZBNT7D8Q?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" title="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.public.health.division.acute.and.communicable.disease.pre/viz/shared/6ZBNT7D8Q?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;dashboard &lt;/a&gt;that visualizes data on communicable disease incidence in Oregon. The dashboard’s data are disease, month, demographic group and county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that we have a highly safe and effective vaccine – it is our strongest line of defense and the best way to keep yourself, your children and your community safe. If you have questions about the vaccine, we encourage you to talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns.” said Dr. Nolt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to studies, in a room full of people exposed to measles, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/" target="_blank" title="https://www.statnews.com/2019/02/14/measles-infection-virus-spread/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; who are unvaccinated will develop the disease. In addition, it can linger in the air for up to 2 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in healthy people, measles can cause the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 out of every 1,000 measles cases will develop acute encephalitis, which often results in permanent brain damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, but fatal degenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behavioral and intellectual deterioration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seizures that generally develop 7 to 10 years after measles infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;) has reported that 95 percent of active measles cases are in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KATU</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 23:39:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxORE0wSWZHcmx6OERXeHFmTHhXSWQtb2RPVVU3cTBlcUZnLTQwVEV4akFjVDU0Zk1Yb3Bac1JWeDlWWFVsNG0zVVpKek5Eb0V3d2tvSmd3OWFHOFBNUHJxeVVOOFpjZGtBZmFqZ0pkUGd3OGl6MnhXaTZWSy02NFdLek9RMDFTSmozQ3Q5QjUtWDFXa3NBVklmUThFTWVPQTBpaU5hUWpn</guid></item><item><title>Only 10% of non-surgical treatments for back problems kill pain, says review - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxPMFVPd25HQzk2dWlvV1ctc0R0YmxRSmFvMlhPa2FBbjdyR3lCeE1rdHF5b0hXQmJ4RjJHSFlaQ2Z6R192U1JUM3QxRDM3QThMcU5KT1FtdEJ0WnJsd05pWHlCT0s0VlNUZWxPbE4tWXBLbWpGYUNhU1N6R1NlLUE1S0d2dTd6RDRzM1V4Q0RDT2hVNmlfdjM1TW1TNHFuXzNTQi1sMFVkSFp6S2NKVFpiTVlpR2JNMFl4enZXQjhZSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Most treatments for back pain do not work and even the few that do bring little relief, a global review of the evidence on one of the world’s commonest health problems has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Six in 10 adults in the UK live with lower back pain at some point.

The other 50 treatments either do not work, only modestly reduce pain or may even worsen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;That is the conclusion of the most comprehensive review yet of the worldwide evidence surrounding what non-surgical treatments have analgesic – pain-killing – effects on back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Australian researchers led by Dr Aidan Cashin at the pain impact centre at Neuroscience Research Australia examined 301 previously published randomised controlled trials that investigated the 56 treatments or combinations of treatments, such as anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants. The trials were carried out in 44 countries worldwide, including in Europe, North America and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The current evidence shows that one in 10 non-surgical and non-interventional treatments for low-back pain are efficacious, providing only small analgesic effects beyond placebo,” conclude the authors, whose findings are published in the medical journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The efficacy for the majority of treatments is uncertain. Our review did not find reliable evidence of large effects for any of the included treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The one treatment that does help those with acute low-back pain is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), they found. In addition, five treatments also bring some relief for chronic low-back pain: exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, &lt;a href="https://www.neuromusculartaping.com/clarifying-the-differences-between-various-taping-techniques-in-rehabilitation-nmt/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;taping&lt;/a&gt;, antidepressants and what are known as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TPRV1) drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But three treatments for acute back pain do not work – exercise, glucocortisoid injections and taking paracetamol. And two for chronic back pain are also ineffective – antibiotics and anaesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, the evidence for the other 45 treatments is “inconclusive”. The researchers assessed and offered a judgement on the extent to which they all relieved pain. Despite some of them being very popular, most “may provide modest reductions in pain”, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Interventions that “probably provide little to no difference in pain” include exercise, paracetamol, glucocortisoid injections, anaesthetics and antibiotics or antimicrobial drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, having a massage, taking painkillers and wearing foot orthotics “may provide” large reductions in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Heat, acupuncture, spinal manipulation and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/transcutaneous-electrical-nerve-stimulation-tens/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;TENS&lt;/a&gt;) may produce a “moderate” reduction in pain. Osteopathic treatment and using muscle relaxants and NSAIDs together may produce a small lessening of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, two treatments may increase someone’s pain, including extracorporeal shockwaves and the anti-inflammatory drug &lt;a href="https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/colchicine/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;colchicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said that family doctors often refer patients with back pain for physiotherapy as a first-line treatment, to be assessed and given exercises to perform, or to link workers, who suggest non-medical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Many patients do report feeling some relief from the interventions – medical or not – that we suggest,” Hawthorne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Tim Button, the president of the British Chiropractic Association, welcomed the study’s endorsement of spinal manipulation and taping as effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Our members are increasingly seeing patients come to them with back pain, worried that they can’t work and stuck on NHS waiting lists,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“While this may not always be a &lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;miracle cure&lt;em&gt;’&lt;/em&gt; to chronic musculoskeletal conditions, it is as effective as other non-invasive treatments and makes a real difference to how quickly people can get back to work and normal life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A Chartered Society of Physiotherapy spokesperson said: “Physiotherapists carry out an in-depth assessment to identify the root causes of back pain, which will be different for everyone and can range widely from stress, fear of movement and poor sleep to smoking, obesity, job-related strain, and insufficient physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Exercise has been shown to be the most helpful treatment for back pain. Hands-on treatments have been shown to have a small benefit to back pain, but only when used as part of a whole treatment programme, which includes exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Similarly, injections may be beneficial as part of a treatment programme, but not on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPMFVPd25HQzk2dWlvV1ctc0R0YmxRSmFvMlhPa2FBbjdyR3lCeE1rdHF5b0hXQmJ4RjJHSFlaQ2Z6R192U1JUM3QxRDM3QThMcU5KT1FtdEJ0WnJsd05pWHlCT0s0VlNUZWxPbE4tWXBLbWpGYUNhU1N6R1NlLUE1S0d2dTd6RDRzM1V4Q0RDT2hVNmlfdjM1TW1TNHFuXzNTQi1sMFVkSFp6S2NKVFpiTVlpR2JNMFl4enZXQjhZSQ</guid></item><item><title>Pet food sold in WA recalled after link to bird flu -

        &lt;p&gt;The House Health Committee changed a hot-button bill on school vaccination requirements to focus on exemptions for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_614828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-614828" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-614828" src="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders-100x150.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders-200x300.jpg 200w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders-233x350.jpg 233w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders-100x150.jpg 100w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Chris-Anders.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-614828" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Chris Anders&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, if I reading the amendment correctly, for clarification, it removes philosophical and religious exemptions. Am I correct?” asked Delegate Chris Anders, R-Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, he was correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A majority of members of the House Health and Human Resources Committee voted to make key changes to a bill that came over from the Senate. And then a majority of the committee members, 18-7, took another vote to advance a bill reflecting those changes to the full House of Delegates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now it is a very different bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the legislative session began, Gov. Patrick Morrisey called for policies allowing for religious exemptions to school vaccination requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all states except California, Mississippi, and West Virginia allow religious or philosophical exemptions for school vaccines, granting parents the ability to opt their children out of vaccinations based on sincerely held beliefs.&lt;span class="pjBG2e" data-cid="3ea2bf28-7111-40fb-a5b6-e06eefa56441"&gt;&lt;span class="UV3uM"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, West Virginia students entering school for the first time &lt;a href="https://oeps.wv.gov/immunizations/Documents/school/New_School_Entry.pdf"&gt;must show proof&lt;/a&gt; of immunization against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B unless properly medically exempted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state Senate, nearly a month ago, overwhelmingly passed &lt;a href="https://www.wvlegislature.gov/Bill_Status/bills_history.cfm?INPUT=460&amp;amp;year=2025&amp;amp;sessiontype=RS"&gt;SB 460,&lt;/a&gt; which at that point would have allowed religious or philosophical exemptions if parents or legal guardians object on legal grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill got hung up in the House of Delegates as members worked to determine what could actually pass. During that time, the state Department of Health &lt;a href="https://dhhr.wv.gov/News/2025/Pages/Department-of-Health-Issues-Alert-After-West-Virginians-Potentially-Exposed-to-Measles-at-Dulles-Airport.aspx"&gt;issued an advisory&lt;/a&gt; that some West Virginians could have been exposed to measles carried by a traveler at Dulles Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Anders told members of the committee that he does not like the changes to the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a free people. We are not subjects of the state. Government does not own our bodies or our children’s bodies. This amendment is a direct assault on freedom, parental rights. It is unacceptable if we allow the government to mandate this, we surrender the very essence of liberty itself,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_614829" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-614829" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-614829 size-thumbnail" src="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Ian-Masters-100x150.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Ian-Masters-200x300.jpg 200w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Ian-Masters-100x150.jpg 100w, https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2025/03/Ian-Masters.jpg 216w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-614829" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ian Masters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Ian Masters, R-Berkeley, said he would have preferred religious and philosophical exemptions in the bill. But he spoke in favor of the bill’s emphasis on medical exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While I too may have liked this, though, to come out stronger, I think what we’re actually accomplishing here is fixing a medical exemption that essentially doesn’t exist,” Masters said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_562605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-562605" class="wp-caption alignleft"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-562605 size-thumbnail" src="https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com/wvmn-s3/2024/03/YgOBdOyR-hite_michael-100x150.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-562605" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Michael Hite&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Michael Hite, R-Berkeley, made a similar point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether or not we wanted religious or philosophical exceptions or not is irrelevant at this point,” Hite said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This bill shores up the medical exemptions that we heard testimony in here that that weren’t happening, that were needed and that there were issues with and I think this bill has strengthened those medical exemptions to make sure that those people who testified in this committee will get the exemptions that they need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_500541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-500541" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-500541" src="https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike-100x150.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike-200x300.jpg 200w, https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike-233x350.jpg 233w, https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike-100x150.jpg 100w, https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/pushkin_mike.jpg 333w" sizes="(max-width: 100px) 100vw, 100px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-500541" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mike Pushkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, voted in favor of making the changes to the bill and then voted against passing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s better than it was, but it’s still very dangerous,” Pushkin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushkin later said West Virginia leads the nation in protections against the spread of infectious disease — and should fight to keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing positive that we lead the nation in is some of our public health laws in regards to childhood immunization, and you’re not hearing of these types of outbreaks, whether it’s measles or Rubella or all the things that are starting to make a comeback in other states that have weakened their laws,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’re not hearing about it here. I’d like to keep it that way. I’m a strong no on even this is a better bill than what we have, but it’s still, why are we messing with something that’s working?”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

						Ohio health officials provided an update on the nationwide measles outbreak Tuesday.Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health, hosted the press conference, along with Dr. Matthew Washam, an infections disease doctor at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus.Officials discussed the outbreak while stressing the importance of parents keeping up to date with their children's vaccinations on the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. Vanderhoff said the MMR vaccine is highly effective and safe."The recommended two dose regimen for children has been proven to be 97% effective at protecting against measles, and we also know it is very safe," Vanderhoff said. "There have been some spurious claims in the past that the vaccine is connected to autism, but those claims have been debunked and there is no evidence of a connection."The percentage of students who were up to date on the MMR fell from 89.2 percent in the 2023-24 school year to 88.3 percent in the most recent school year.Measles outbreaks are growing in West Texas and New Mexico. Testing sites and vaccine clinics have opened in outbreak areas and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas last week to support the response. Still, local health officials say spread could continue for months."You can get measles literally by just being in a room where a person with measles has been recently," Vanderhoff said. "This can happen even up to two hours after the person has left."Late last month, Kentucky health officials confirmed an adult had tested positive for the virus, in FrankfortAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 301 cases have been confirmed as of Thursday, March 13, in 15 states. This year, there have been no reported cases in Indiana or Ohio.

"There have been some spurious claims in the past that the vaccine is connected to autism, but those claims have been debunked and there is no evidence of a connection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of students who were up to date on the MMR fell from 89.2 percent in the 2023-24 school year to 88.3 percent in the most recent school year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wlwt.com/article/cdc-texas-measles-outbreak/64039606" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Measles outbreaks are growing in West Texas and New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. Testing sites and vaccine clinics have opened in outbreak areas and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas last week to support the response. Still, local health officials say spread could continue for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can get measles literally by just being in a room where a person with measles has been recently," Vanderhoff said. "This can happen even up to two hours after the person has left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last month, Kentucky health officials &lt;a href="https://www.wlwt.com/article/kentucky-measles-case-frankfort-virus-doctors/63944983" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed an adult had tested positive for the virus&lt;/a&gt;, in Frankfort&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;301 cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; as of Thursday, March 13, in 15 states. This year, there have been no reported cases in Indiana or Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Katherine Wells, director of public health for the city of Lubbock, said the outbreak is still growing, with capacity to transmit both locally and further afield through spread to pockets of unvaccinated individuals. Though the response teams have been stressing the importance of vaccination, uptake of vaccines “has definitely been a struggle,” Wells said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is going to be a large outbreak. And we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases, both because we’re still seeing spread and also because we have increased testing capacity, so more people are getting tested,” Wells said during a press conference organized by the Big Cities Health Coalition, a forum for leaders of metropolitan health departments. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long in order to get through this entire outbreak,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If the outbreak lasts for longer than 12 months, the United States would lose its status as a country that has achieved &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;measles elimination&lt;/a&gt;. Measles-free status means that all cases are either contracted abroad, or linked to spread from someone who has been infected elsewhere. If that ensuing transmission continues for more than a year, however, the virus would be deemed to be endemic again in the country. The U.S. achieved measles elimination status in 2000, but came close to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/04/measles-outbreaks-put-u-s-at-risk-of-losing-prized-elimination-status/"&gt;losing that status in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when a long-running outbreak in New York City and surrounding counties continued for close to a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, Texas has confirmed 279 cases, though that number is undoubtedly &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/12/measles-outbreak-larger-than-reported-public-health-experts-say/"&gt;an underestimate&lt;/a&gt;. There are now cases reported in 11 counties in Texas, with the epicenter of the outbreak in rural west Texas, in a community of Mennonites who do not vaccinate their children. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Only two&lt;/a&gt; of the confirmed cases in Texas have had the recommended two doses of measles-targeting vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To date Texas has recorded one death in this outbreak, in an unvaccinated school-aged child. New Mexico &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has recorded 38 cases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/06/new-mexico-adult-with-measles-dies/"&gt;one death&lt;/a&gt;, in an unvaccinated adult. Oklahoma has reported &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/osdh-reports-additional-measles-cases.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;four confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt;, all in unvaccinated individuals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That evidence of spread underscores the challenges public health faces in bringing the outbreak under control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I just think that it being so rural, now multi-state, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work, to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though efforts to increase vaccination rates among the most affected communities are not meeting with substantial success, Wells said in Lubbock about 300 more doses than normally would be administered have been given in the past couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mixed messaging about the best way to combat measles could be contributing to the difficulties in bringing the outbreak to a close, suggested Phil Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Neither Huang nor the other public health officials at the press conference referenced Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. directly in their remarks. And at a point, Huang sidestepped a question about whether Kennedy — a long-time critic of vaccines, particularly the measles, mumps and rubella shot — was undermining the effort to persuade parents of unvaccinated children to get them vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In interviews and&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/rfk-jr-vaccine-skepticism-on-view-in-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt; a commentary published on the Fox News site&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy has stressed treatment of measles over prevention of the disease, urging the use of vitamin A and cod liver oil. While vitamin A has been shown to improve survival of malnourished children in developing countries when they contract measles, it is in no way a preventive measure. Although it is common practice in measles outbreaks for public health leaders to stress the importance of vaccination, Kennedy has said the decision of whether to vaccinate is down to parental choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“One of the things that we really depend on … is a consistent message, really, from all levels,” Huang said. “All of us, from the highest level down to the ground level need to be reinforcing that message about the importance of vaccines and that vaccines are the way we prevent this and are going to address this, and need to address this.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And we do have some concerns when some other messages might dilute that message.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simbo Ige, Chicago’s commissioner of public health, spoke of the struggles her department faced last year during a &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;large measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that began in a migrant shelter in the city. Over the course of the outbreak, 30,000 doses of vaccine were administered, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin A was not the reason why we got to [measles] elimination. It was the vaccination,” Ige said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
