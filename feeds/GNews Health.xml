			&lt;p&gt;A common type of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus_infection"&gt;human papillomavirus&lt;/a&gt; (HPV) could be more dangerous than we thought. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="169949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, known as beta-HPV, was thought in rare cases to contribute to skin  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="169949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by worsening UV damage, but a new study suggests it can actually hijack the body's cells to directly drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fresh conclusions came from a study of a 34-year-old woman who sought medical help for &lt;a href="https://dermnetnz.org/topics/cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma"&gt;cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; (cSCC) on her forehead. Her tumors were repeatedly growing back, even after immunotherapy and surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/modified-herpes-virus-found-to-shrink-deadly-skin-cancers-in-clinical-trial"&gt;Modified Herpes Virus Found to Shrink Deadly Skin Cancers in Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A closer genetic analysis revealed something surprising: the beta-HPV had actually integrated itself into the DNA of the woman's tumor, where it was producing viral proteins that helped the cancer thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before now, beta-HPV had never been found to integrate into cellular DNA, let alone actively maintain a cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It suggests that there may be more people out there with aggressive forms of cSCC who have an underlying immune defect and could benefit from treatments targeting the immune system," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; immunologist Andrea Lisco from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman who was the subject of this study had an inherited immune disorder, one which prevented her &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_cell"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt; from attacking HPV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169952" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg" alt="ZAP70 proteins" class="wp-image-169952 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/ProteinChart-600x349.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169952" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Issues with the ZAP70 protein were key to the research. (Ye et al., &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tests revealed that the woman's immune system could still repair DNA damage from UV radiation – the typical cause of cSCC – the impairment of her T cells meant the beta-HPV could invade her skin cells and trigger the formation of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T&lt;span&gt;he immunocompromised woman was also being treated for other HPV-related illnesses, including warts on the skin and in the mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the cause of her condition was discovered, the patient received a bone marrow &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/stem-cell-transplant"&gt;stem cell transplant&lt;/a&gt;, to replace her dysfunctional T cells with healthy ones. This cleared up the aggressive skin cancer and her other HPV-caused issues, none of which returned during a three-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery and successful outcome would not have been possible without the combined expertise of virologists, immunologists, oncologists and transplant specialists, all working under the same roof," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study by no means minimizes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sunlight-can-still-damage-skin-through-a-closed-window-heres-how"&gt;the role of UV radiation&lt;/a&gt; as a cause of skin cancer, but shows that there are other factors at work too. In rare cases like this, normally benign &lt;span&gt;viruses&lt;/span&gt; can have devastating effects in people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That emphasizes the need for targeted, personalized &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-3-strategies-can-improve-outcomes-for-cancer-patients"&gt;cancer treatments&lt;/a&gt; that may well be more effective than conventional and generic approaches. It's likely that the woman involved in this study is far from the only one with this set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reason to be hopeful could come from progress against a related disease. Alpha-HPV is known as the cause of many cervical and throat cancers, and widespread vaccination against the virus has resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-american-deaths-from-cervical-cancer-fall-sharply-after-hpv-vaccine"&gt;drastic drop&lt;/a&gt; in deaths from those cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a single, universal cure for cancer remains elusive, we are continuing to see steadily improving &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-drug-helped-cancer-patients-live-40-longer-in-clinical-trial"&gt;survival and recovery rates&lt;/a&gt; across many cancer types, including cSCC – something this new research should also help with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery could completely change how we think about the development, and consequently the treatment, of cSCC in people who have a health condition that compromises immune function," &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/beta-hpv-can-directly-cause-skin-cancer-immunocompromised-people"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2502114"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

When these sleep issues persist for several months or longer, it’s usually a good idea to visit a doctor to see if you have an underlying condition, like depression, restless legs syndrome or sleep apnea, that requires medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EZC65YERJZGEBA5Y4KKNVG2VNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But for occasional periods of insomnia that leave you feeling bleary-eyed, experts say there may be some dietary supplements and even foods that can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="73D67XOZ2RC6VC4VA5K6YASBGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s important to recognize that no dietary supplement is going to radically improve your sleep. Supplements shouldn’t be viewed as a long-term solution. And almost all supplements carry the risk of side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VH4NAHLAHJG5JGKK7AMLTA5S3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But some may produce modest benefits, such as helping you fall asleep slightly faster at night, and carry minimal side effects when taken in smaller doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BSKIBFFHZ5B4HB5L2APFMWQZYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We spoke to sleep and nutrition experts and reviewed dozens of studies to find out what the science says about five popular supplements.

It’s produced primarily in the evening. But melatonin isn’t going to quickly send you off to sleep like a fast-acting sleeping pill. Instead, it promotes sleepiness by signaling to your body that it’s nighttime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DEP7S23IINHHNPMFQMDMMD7QVE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For that reason, melatonin supplements are most helpful for people with sleep timing problems, said Phyllis C. Zee, the medical director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. That includes people with jet lag, shift workers who work late at night or early in the morning, and people who routinely struggle to fall asleep until it’s extremely late at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EZVVEH3CI5FE3N6YKGUB2AUI4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For those people, taking a melatonin supplement in the evening can set their biological clocks earlier, helping them fall asleep and wake up earlier, Zee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BDJNMJ65LFD67BSYADGSTK4SEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Melatonin supplements may also benefit older adults, because melatonin levels naturally decline with age, as well as postmenopausal women, said Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, a sleep medicine specialist and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. “I think some people are more sensitive to it and can get some improvements in their sleep from it,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PFN3OM4T6NELHEPECSKNJG7NUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many studies have examined whether melatonin can alleviate&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;insomnia, and the data is mostly mixed, Abbasi-Feinberg said. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4273450/" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that it can help people fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G3WL72KPS5ARPFUHW4XKUQHSXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the American Academy of Sleep Medicine &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/melatonin-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank"&gt;says that&lt;/a&gt; there “isn’t enough strong evidence on the effectiveness or safety of melatonin supplementation for chronic insomnia” to recommend its use. If you find that you’re  having trouble falling asleep or staying asleep at least three times a week for three months or longer — the criteria for chronic insomnia — then you should visit a doctor or a sleep specialist, Zee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ACPRGLSPKFCMXPGKZ4RT3XJT2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you are going to try melatonin for an occasional sleep timing problem, it’s best that you use a low dose, around half a milligram to three milligrams, said Zee at Northwestern. You also have to get the timing right: Melatonin should be taken about two hours before bedtime for it to be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSVXKGSAZ5BJTGCBB5UFKRG6CE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/25/melatonin-children-sleep-fda-study/" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that several melatonin products are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/25/melatonin-gummies-dose-safety/" target="_blank"&gt;“inaccurately labeled,”&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27855744/" target="_blank"&gt;several containing&lt;/a&gt; more melatonin than advertised. When shopping for melatonin, check for third-party certifications, which mean the products were independently vetted for purity and potency. Look for the black and yellow &lt;a href="https://quality-supplements.org/usp_verified_products" target="_blank"&gt;“USP Verified”&lt;/a&gt; logo or the blue and white &lt;a href="https://www.nsfsport.com/certified-products/" target="_blank"&gt;“NSF” logo&lt;/a&gt;.

These side effects typically occur with doses above 350 milligrams. “It’s important to note that more is not better,” said Zee at Northwestern. “Check with your doctor and let them know that you’re taking magnesium and the dose to avoid possible interactions with other medications or medical conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TUDCANEELVAYFIKJAVRUI32LCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A healthy gut may promote healthy sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6779243/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that higher levels of gut microbiome diversity — generally considered a sign of a healthy gut — are associated with longer, better sleep and fewer nighttime awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GAGKH7I3I5HXXN3JGZKEXLTZJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many hormones and metabolites that are produced by our gut microbes act directly on the brain to influence sleep regulation, including neurotransmitters like serotonin, said Chris Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at the University of Washington Medical Center and the author of &lt;a href="https://gutbites.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Gut Bites MD&lt;/a&gt;, a blog on gut health and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4VLX6SSZGZCJ3NUEYMPOIGGNAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s one reason Abbasi-Feinberg encourages her patients to consume probiotics, which are live bacteria and other microorganisms that confer health benefits. But probiotic supplements — which are available in capsules, gummies, powders and pills&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;—&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;can have some downsides. For one, they tend to contain concentrated doses of just a few strains of bacteria. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/28/probiotics-supplements-gut-health-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that taking them may actually reduce the microbial diversity in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PS25EFQFUBE4JIQGQXFNE4ARCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, Abbasi-Feinberg recommends that you get probiotics from fermented foods, like plain yogurt, kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and tempeh. These fermented foods typically contain not only probiotics (the live microbes) but also prebiotics (the fiber the microbes eat) and postbiotics (the vitamins and nutrients they produce).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DVCURU7VPVHM7NUMXSZPPIUTAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1602898" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;involving 29 people found that older adults who drank a little more than a half cup of fermented milk every day for three weeks fell asleep more quickly at night and had fewer nighttime awakenings compared to when they drank a placebo. Several studies have shown that fermented foods also have other health benefits, including &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/04/probiotics-prebiotics-postbiotics-microbiome/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ISA62BORHFDOLJ6WA7QL7U5DC4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abbasi-Feinberg said she tells patients to add fermented foods to their diets because they have the potential to improve their sleep and have very little downside. “If there’s no risk involved and the benefit is there, then they’re worth a try,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3EVRDXZNNFBKNOBKD7O3YUIDHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s well known that vitamin D is essential for building strong bones. But it’s also necessary for good sleep. Vitamin D helps the body convert tryptophan into serotonin, a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in how well and how long you sleep. As &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11082867/" target="_blank"&gt;one recent study&lt;/a&gt; noted, vitamin D receptors have been found in regions of the brain that regulate sleep, suggesting that it plays a direct role in our nightly shut-eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZFMFEQ54MZBZVHCLGIOXQAE5YM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Vitamin D deficiencies can cause issues with low energy and low mood,” said Abbasi-Feinberg, “and sleep can be affected as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3FEOH4WGTRCCPL4YN3KDYJ2XV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28475473/" target="_blank"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that taking vitamin D can improve sleep. But the data are mixed, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590142721000094" target="_blank"&gt;not every study&lt;/a&gt; has shown benefits. Also, some of the studies involved taking a single large dose as a shot at weekly or biweekly intervals, rather than a daily pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L5NVKIEFJNEAJKHPWPCGS33XZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abbasi-Feinberg said she sometimes encounters patients with sleep problems who work from home and rarely get any exposure to morning sunshine. “They roll out of bed and turn their computer on and, boom, they’re at work and they don’t get outside,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZR3FRL3QHBHR3LBCUHBQO3LMGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That can be a problem because exposure to sunshine helps your body produce vitamin D. It also halts production of melatonin and resets your circadian rhythm, which can help you sleep better at night. For that reason, Abbasi-Feinberg often prescribes morning sunshine to her patients — rather than a vitamin D supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VMSNTDTULFBBXG54UT2YO7JRTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The best way to get vitamin D is to go out into the sunshine,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="list-header-SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4-42" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;h2 id="SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="SVSSSC6PQJEWHAD4W3OA64I4H4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;5.

Nowadays, it’s commonly recommended as a sleep aid. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/04/should-i-take-ashwagandha-benefits-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it can help with insomnia.

In a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0257843" target="_blank"&gt;meta-analysis published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, scientists analyzed five randomized trials involving 400 people that looked at the effects of ashwagandha on sleep compared to placebo. They found a “small but significant effect” of ashwagandha on overall sleep. People who were assigned to take an ashwagandha supplement daily slept on average about 25 minutes longer each night and had greater improvements in sleep quality compared to people who were given placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N2UDOF6BI5BBVES7PJBMVY6WAE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But the scientists also cautioned that there was limited data on ashwagandha’s potentially serious side effects, and they said that more research was needed to determine whether it was safe for long-term use. (It has been linked to a handful of cases of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548536/" target="_blank"&gt;liver toxicity&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UMG6LVAE3ZHHDDMHCKJGQITQ4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Abassi-Feinberg said she doesn’t necessarily discourage people from trying ashwagandha or other Ayurvedic remedies to help them sleep if they’re not known to be harmful. But she feels that there’s not enough strong evidence to recommend them. “I’m not enthusiastic about them because I feel like the data just aren’t there yet,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQW3RIPEAZGEBEEEXDFS66UFOM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/04/should-i-take-ashwagandha-benefits-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;also recommend&lt;/a&gt; that some people avoid ashwagandha altogether for safety reasons, such as women who are pregnant or nursing, people with an autoimmune,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;liver, or thyroid disorder, and people who are taking sedative medications such as gabapentin or benzodiazepines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

&lt;p&gt;If anyone needed a reminder that US health secretary and fervent anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has no background in science or medicine, look no further than &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766"&gt;the video he posted on social media&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two-and-a-half-minute clip, Kennedy announced that he is cancelling nearly $500 million in funding for the development of mRNA-based vaccines against diseases that pose pandemic threats. The funding will be clawed back from 22 now-defunct contracts awarded through the federal agency tasked with developing medical countermeasures to public health threats. The agency is the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is generally opposed to vaccines, but he is particularly hostile to mRNA-based vaccines. Since the remarkably successful debut of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic—which were developed and mass-produced with unprecedented speed—Kennedy has continually disparaged and spread misinformation about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video on Tuesday, Kennedy continued that trend, erroneously saying that, "as the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don't perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract." In reality, COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have saved &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations"&gt;more than 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; in the US in just the first two years of the pandemic and additionally prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations in the US in that time. Nearly all &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-vaccine-doses-by-manufacturer?country=~USA"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines used in the US&lt;/a&gt; are mRNA-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Kennedy's video only went more off the rails from there. He continued on with this nonsensical explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the problem: mRNA only codes for a small part of viral proteins usually a single antigen. One mutation, and the vaccine becomes ineffective. This dynamic drives a phenomenon called antigenic shift meaning that the vaccine paradoxically encourages new mutations and can actually prolong pandemics as the virus constantly mutates to escape the protective effects of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fact-check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To unpack this nonsense, let's start with how mRNA-based vaccines work. These vaccines deliver a snippet of genetic code—in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA)—to cells. Our cells then translate that mRNA code into a protein that the immune system can, essentially, use for target practice, producing antibodies and cell-based responses against it. After that, if the immune system ever encounters that snippet on an actual invading virus or other germ, it will then recognize it and mount a protective response. Such snippets of germs or other harmful things that can prompt an immune response are generally called antigens.&lt;/p&gt;

servings of French fries a week could increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An international team of researchers, including an expert from the University of Cambridge, investigated links between potato consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Overall they found a 20% increased risk for those who ate French fries at least three times a week, but not for those who ate baked, boiled or mashed potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Faye Riley, from Diabetes UK, said: "This research shows that the link between potatoes and type 2 diabetes isn't as clear-cut as it might seem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Academics analysed data from studies tracking the health of more than 205,000 medical workers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Repeated surveys were taken about people's diets over almost four decades and during follow-up periods 22,000 cases of type 2 diabetes were documented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block"

class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The association between higher potato intake and increased [type 2 diabetes] risk is primarily driven by intake of French fries," the study authors wrote in The British Medical Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Higher intake of French fries, but not combined baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes, was associated with a higher risk of [type 2 diabetes]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The research team also found replacing three servings of potatoes each week with whole grains was found to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes by 8%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They added replacing potatoes with white rice, however was also associated with an increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Riley, research communications lead at Diabetes UK, said: "Type 2 diabetes is a complex condition, with many factors influencing its development, including genetics, age and ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Diet is just one part of the picture, but this study suggests that how food is prepared can make a difference and reinforces the advice to prioritise whole grains and cut back on fried or heavily processed foods as a way to support a balanced diet and reduce your risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block"

            The wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles earlier this year — burning entire neighborhoods to the ground, straining firefighting resources and forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes — may have led to hundreds more deaths than were recorded, a new study suggests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0neuyl00003b6nmgi6vw43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While officials reported that the Palisades and Eaton fires directly killed at least &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/california-wildfires-los-angeles-deaths-75642a4e6cd66a34cbced64c10dd4f3b" target="_blank"&gt;30 people &lt;/a&gt;when they incinerated parts of Los Angeles County, the blazes may be linked to 410 additional deaths from January 5 to February 1, according to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837351#:~:text=While%20there%20were%20only%2030,were%20attributable%20to%20the%20wildfires." target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published Wednesday in the The Journal of the American Medical Association. That would make for a total of 440 wildfire-related deaths, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0opyjn000p3b6ntq4u1uk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These additional deaths likely reflect a combination of factors, including increased exposure to poor air quality and health care delays and interruptions,” the study says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0potqa00153b6nmrhh9z3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The wildfires’ impact on his loved ones motivated Andrew Stokes, a mortality demographer and one of the authors of the study, to probe for  excess deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qbjbd001d3b6nijxjz087@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Having had many family and friends who were directly affected made me feel compelled to look into this further, using my expertise as a demographer and a person who studies mortality statistics,” the Boston University associate professor told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0p1jce000v3b6nwlcucvrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new findings highlight the need to quantify just how deadly wildfires and other climate-related emergencies can be beyond direct fatalities. The emergencies can have long-term health effects that extend well beyond the disaster itself, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qi4w2001k3b6nkciuld07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Years ago, Stokes evaluated the excess deaths during the pandemic after many deaths went uncounted, he said. After developing models to understand the true toll of the virus, Stokes used that expertise to look at the true mortality burden of natural disasters such as the Los Angeles wildfires.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0nphbe00073b6nk9sk6ot9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Along with deaths directly related to the wildfire, the researchers counted deaths partially and indirectly attributed to the wildfires. That includes lung or heart conditions exacerbated by smoke or stress, disruptions to health systems and mental health impacts, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0o0kh4000a3b6n27lesffe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To conduct the study, the researchers compared recorded deaths in Los Angeles County from January to February with figures from previous years, excluding 2020 to 2023 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That helped researchers estimate how many deaths would have been expected in that time period had no wildfires occurred, Stokes said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qldfb001q3b6n3ny2biap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They then calculated excess deaths as the difference between observed and expected deaths, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0ok2i8000g3b6nipk4blcq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In Los Angeles County, weekly deaths consistently exceeded expected deaths during the period from January 5 to February 1, 2025,” the study says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0oc1ub000d3b6nvqr511gj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A total of 6,371 deaths were observed in the county, compared with 5,931 expected deaths, according to the study. This means that nearly 7% of the recorded deaths in Los Angeles County were excess deaths linked to the wildfires.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qiqg0001o3b6njg3yscn9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stokes said he was “really surprised and alarmed” at the findings. “The magnitude of the underreporting in the official data is just very severe,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qncns001w3b6nnwxxqpzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he hopes that quantifying the excess deaths can spur authorities to provide more assistance to those still grappling with the devastation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0p77vq000z3b6nngwt1n31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers note that the data is preliminary and the toll could grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0qqbt900223b6nkuob69mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That 440 value that we estimate is clearly the lower bound, because we only look at the first weeks after the wildfire started,” Stokes said. “These medium and long- term effects … could manifest over time as people develop wildfire related diseases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0ps4z600173b6n7vrewn07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Future studies should investigate the longer-term health impacts of the wildfires and the specific causes of excess wildfire deaths, the researchers said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In a major new finding almost a decade in the making, researchers at Harvard Medical School&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;say they’ve found a key that may unlock many of the mysteries of Alzheimer’s disease and brain aging — the humble metal lithium.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700042e6d9nbs3ezv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lithium is best known to medicine as a mood stabilizer given to people who have bipolar disorder and depression. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1970, but it was used by doctors to treat mood disorders for nearly a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3712976/" target="_blank"&gt;century beforehand&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700072e6d3ciy5a48@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that lithium is naturally present in the body in tiny amounts and that cells require it to function normally — much like vitamin C or iron. It also appears to play a critical role in maintaining brain health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700092e6dqorrd12k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a series of experiments reported Wednesday in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09335-x#Ack1" target="_blank"&gt;journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at Harvard and Rush universities found that depleting lithium in the diet of normal mice caused their brains to develop inflammation and changes associated with accelerated aging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000a2e6dr41esi18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In mice that were specially bred to develop the same kinds of brain changes as humans with Alzheimer’s disease, a low-lithium diet revved the buildup of sticky proteins that form plaques and tangles in the brains that are hallmarks of the disease. It also sped up memory loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000b2e6duy5bw3rj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maintaining normal lithium levels in mice as they aged, however, protected them from brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0pqn82000c3b6n2q1tyubz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If further research supports the findings, it could open the door to new treatments and diagnostic tests for Alzheimer’s, which affects an estimated 6.7 million older adults in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alzheimers-dementia/about/index.html#:~:text=A%20growing%20problem,getting%20lost%20in%20familiar%20areas." target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000c2e6dmf1gei3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research provides a unifying theory that helps explain so many of the puzzle pieces scientists have been trying to fit together for decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000d2e6dqvo9k9tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is a potential candidate for a common mechanism leading to the multisystem degeneration of the brain that precedes dementia,” said Dr. Bruce Yankner, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, who led the study. “It will take a lot more science to determine whether this is a common pathway… or one of several pathways,” to Alzheimer’s, he added. “The data are very intriguing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000e2e6drk22gs88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an editorial published in Nature, Dr. Ashley Bush, a neuroscientist who directs the Melbourne Dementia Research Center at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said the researchers “present compelling evidence that lithium does in fact have a physiological role and that normal aging might impair the regulation of lithium levels in the brain.” He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000f2e6dnf557bld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Close examination of human and animal brain tissues, along with genetic investigations in the study, found the mechanism that appears to be at play: Beta amyloid plaques — the sticky deposits that gum up the brains of Alzheimer’s patients — bind to lithium and hold it, including the type that’s normally present in the body, as well as the commonly prescribed form. This binding depletes lithium available for nearby cells, including important scavengers known as microglia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000g2e6dmb1i7t9t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the brain is healthy and functioning normally, microglia are waste managers, clearing away beta amyloid before it can accumulate and can cause harm.  In the team’s experiments, microglia from the brains of lithium-deficient mice showed a reduced ability to sweep away and break down beta amyloid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000h2e6dxorelmou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yankner believes this creates a downward spiral. The accumulation of beta amyloid soaks up more and more lithium, further crippling the brain’s ability to clear it away.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000i2e6de4jl714f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He and his colleagues tested different lithium compounds and found one — lithium orotate — that doesn’t bind to amyloid beta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000j2e6dya77ckhf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they gave lithium orotate to mice with signs of Alzheimer’s in their brains, these changes reversed: Beta amyloid plaques and tangles of tau that were choking the memory centers of the brain were reduced.  Mice treated with lithium were once again able to navigate mazes and learn to identify new objects, whereas those who got placebos showed no change in their memory and thinking deficits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0pfoh500033b6n9wf3kjrr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In its natural form, lithium is an element, a soft, silvery-white metal that readily combines with other elements to form compounds and salts. It’s naturally present in the environment, including in food and water.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0pq0uw00073b6nqfqlcqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have never fully known how it works to improve mood — only that it does. The original formula for 7Up soda included lithium — it was called 7Up Lithiated Lemon Soda — and &lt;a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geology/lithium.htm" target="_blank"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; as a hangover cure and mood lifter “for hospital or home use.” Some hot springs known to contain mineral water brimming with lithium became sought out &lt;a href="https://ashland.news/viewpoint-the-virtues-of-ashlands-lithia-water/" target="_blank"&gt;wellness destinations&lt;/a&gt; for their curative powers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000k2e6drwqnc6r5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, people who take prescription doses of lithium — which were much higher than the doses used in the new study — can sometimes develop thyroid or kidney toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0rj6tb00022e6dslccooq8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tests of the mice given low doses of lithium orotate showed no signs of damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000l2e6d42997iem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s encouraging, Yankner said, but it doesn’t mean people should try to take lithium supplements on their own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000m2e6dxf3k1ntl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A mouse is not a human. Nobody should take anything based just on mouse studies,” Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000n2e6d4kgn5nr0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The lithium treatment data we have is in mice, and it needs to be replicated in humans. We need to find the right dose in humans,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000o2e6dil2gmghu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The normal amounts of lithium in our bodies, and the concentrations given to the mice, are small — about 1,000 times lower than doses given to treat bipolar disorder, Yankner notes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000p2e6dw1alkjx0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yankner said he hoped toxicity trials of lithium salts would start soon.  Neither he nor any of his co-authors have a financial interest in the outcome of the research, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000q2e6d2a7gwazq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The National Institutes of Health was the major funder of the study, along with grants from private foundations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000r2e6dk5mdboxt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “NIH support was absolutely critical for this work,” Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000s2e6d5dbyhdzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new research corroborates earlier studies hinting that lithium might be important for Alzheimer’s. A large Danish study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28832877/" target="_blank"&gt;published in 2017&lt;/a&gt; found people with higher levels of lithium in their drinking water were less likely to be diagnosed with dementia compared with those whose tap water contained naturally lower lithium levels. Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8929585/#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20lithium%20was,with%20either%20AD%20or%20VD." target="_blank"&gt;large study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2022 from the United Kingdom found that people prescribed lithium were about half as likely has those in a control group to be diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, suggesting a protective effect of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000t2e6ddw3xyw1r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But lithium’s use in psychiatry caused it to become type cast as therapeutic, Yankner said.  No one realized it might be important to the body’s normal physiology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000u2e6d6wnffvp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That happened in part because the amounts of lithium that typically circulate in the body are so small, they couldn’t be quantified until recently. Yankner and his team had to adapt new technology to measure it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000v2e6doq3wa1ns@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the first stage of the research, the scientists tested the brain tissue and blood of older patients collected by the brain bank at Rush University for trace levels of 27 metals.  Some of the patients had no history of memory trouble, while others had early memory decline and pronounced Alzheimer’s.  While there was no change in the levels of most metals they measured, lithium was an exception.  Lithium levels were consistently lower in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s compared to those with normal brain function.  The brains of patients Alzheimer’s disease also showed increased levels of zinc and decreased levels of copper, something scientists had observed before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000w2e6d66gj0hwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Consistently finding lower lithium levels in the brains of people with memory loss amounted to a smoking gun, Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000x2e6dwumleo05@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At first, frankly, we were skeptical of the result because it wasn’t expected,” said Yankner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk7000y2e6dni9fbw4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it held up even when they checked samples from other brain banks at Massachusetts General Hospital, Duke and Washington universities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We wanted to know whether this drop in lithium was biologically meaningful, so we devised an experimental protocol where we could take lithium selectively out of the diet of mice and see what happens,” Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700102e6di9q310pn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they fed the mice a low-lithium diet, simply dropping their natural levels by 50%, their brains rapidly developed features of Alzheimer’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700112e6dqw5g1321@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The neurons started to degenerate. The immune cells in the brain went wild in terms of increased inflammation and worse maintenance function of the neurons around them, and it looked more like an advanced Alzheimer patient,” Yankner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700122e6drn0o0irw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team also found the gene expression profiles of lithium-deficient mice and people who had Alzheimer’s disease looked very similar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700132e6d7po1ibpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers then started to look at how this drop in lithium might occur. Yankner said in the earliest stages there’s a decrease in the uptake of lithium in the brain from the blood. They don’t yet know exactly how or why it happens, but it’s likely to be from a variety of things including reduced dietary intake, as well as genetic and environmental factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700142e6dqvmyrtep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The major source of lithium for most people is their diet. Some of the foods that have the most lithium are leafy green vegetables, nuts, legumes and some spices like turmeric and cumin. Some mineral waters are also rich sources.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700152e6d5a9tixep@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, Yankner said, a lot of the foods that have already proven to be healthy and reduce a person’s risk of dementia may be beneficial because of their lithium content.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0m9kk700162e6d4g3bjap0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You know, oftentimes one finds in science that things may have an effect, and you think you know exactly why, but then subsequently turn out to be completely wrong about why,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how should we approach protein with an eye toward longevity? Bhanote and Sehgal are of the same mind about this: Eat more protein-rich plants and fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fish certainly isn’t a plant, it is thought of differently than animal-based proteins because it has a completely different nutritional makeup than meat, and scientific research has repeatedly shown benefits to human health when consumed regularly. Eating fish regularly has been associated with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25969396/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;reducing the risk of premature death by 12%.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sehgal explained that plant-based proteins (such as beans, lentils, chickpeas, soy, nuts and seeds) are loaded with antioxidants, fiber and nutrients that keep our hearts healthy, reduce inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases. “These foods are naturally low in AGEs and do not contribute to TMAO production, making them much gentler on your cells and overall health,” Bhanote added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8804093" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Scientific studies show&lt;/a&gt; that having a diet that prioritizes plant-based proteins lowers the risk of mortality associated with cardiovascular disease and other causes. In other words, replacing animal proteins with plant proteins can add years to your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most Americans meet or exceed the protein recommendation for meat, poultry and eggs, 90% of Americans &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;aren’t meeting the recommended guidelines for seafood&lt;/a&gt;. Sehgal told HuffPost that seafood high in protein and unsaturated fats supports &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32529206/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, promotes &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182174/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;hormone balance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199776/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805" data-affiliate="true"&gt;helps fight inflammation&lt;/a&gt; — all of which contribute to longevity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, no one is disputing that protein is important. It’s crucial to get enough and, as Ferree pointed out, it’s especially important to get enough as we age. But other nutrients are important too, which is why Sehgal said the best diet for longevity is a balanced one that includes a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of eating a balanced diet full of plants certainly isn’t revolutionary news, but it is backed up by many scientific studies. When it comes to longevity — and health in general — science-backed wins out over trendy and new. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-protein-healthy_l_66db5de1e4b01c1d24fc1de6" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7918805"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ferree;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Suzanne J.

She explained that the biggest reasons for this come down to two harmful compounds: advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“AGEs are harmful compounds that form when proteins or fats combine with sugar in the bloodstream,” Bhanote said. She explained that animal-based foods — especially if they are grilled, fried or roasted — are high in AGEs. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6600625/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research shows;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that these compounds can accumulate in your tissues and, over time, can lead to oxidative stress and inflammation, which are key drivers of cellular aging. “AGEs damage proteins, DNA and other vital cellular structures, accelerating the aging process and contributing to chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s,” Bhanote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What about TMAO? Bhanote explained that elevated levels of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9235870/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TMAO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;TMAO&lt;/a&gt; have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, heart attack and stroke — all of which obviously are not good for longevity. “TMAO promotes the accumulation of cholesterol in the arteries and impairs the body’s ability to remove it, leading to inflammation and further damage to the cardiovascular system. This not only compromises heart health but also affects overall cellular function and longevity,” Bhanote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related to the mistake many people make of overemphasizing protein in their diet, &lt;a href="https://cbb.yale.edu/people/raghav-sehgal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Raghav Sehgal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Raghav Sehgal&lt;/a&gt;, a Ph.D. student and Gruber fellow at Yale University whose research focuses on human aging, told HuffPost that one common mistake people make when it comes to longevity is focusing on “miracle diets” promising fast results.

It’s crucial to get enough and, as Ferree pointed out, it’s especially important to get enough as we age. But other nutrients are important too, which is why Sehgal said the best diet for longevity is a balanced one that includes a wide variety of nutrient-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The benefit of eating a balanced diet full of plants certainly isn’t revolutionary news, but it is backed up by many scientific studies. When it comes to longevity — and health in general — science-backed wins out over trendy and new. &lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/is-protein-healthy_l_66db5de1e4b01c1d24fc1de6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alanavalko/unhinged-microfeminisms?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:&amp;quot;He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct&amp;quot; — Women Are Sharing The &amp;quot;Unhinged&amp;quot; Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;"He Thinks This Is Hostile And He Is Correct" — Women Are Sharing The "Unhinged" Ways They Practice Microfeminism That Reaally Grind A Small Man's Gears&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexandraschlagel/which-zodiac-sign-is-the-most-datable?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:It's Time To Find Out Which Zodiac Sign Is The Most Datable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;It's Time To Find Out Which Zodiac Sign Is The Most Datable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also in Goodful: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/dannicaramirez/ugly-privilege-viral-tik-tok-explained?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A Woman Went Viral After Saying She Has &amp;quot;Ugly Privilege&amp;quot; — Here's What It Means And What It Says About Society Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;A Woman Went Viral After Saying She Has "Ugly Privilege" — Here's What It Means And What It Says About Society Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilylaurence/is-protein-healthy-sc?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read it on BuzzFeed.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Read it on BuzzFeed.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Lifestyle Canada</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPVHZQODZ3V19KYktLN0E5VU5XNHlIVW5CdjFCTkxWSHA1TjMxaFNPQi1BcktGQVBqUV9hRDR2Qml3V0t5YW1wRlYzX2NaZi02eE5KLXZjS1BEYkF1OHpldVIwUXc1OHFHUzBaX2NzZ2dnT18xN3NDLWRrR2REM0NMcUxB</guid></item><item><title>华盛顿调查可能的第一个本地疟疾病例- KING5.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxPUjVHbGVkYWpzYmRHd2drTnVEVF9BZHBDOTdhVTQya3hoUnB6M1R0S1N3WnNoWXlXc2VRVmFFMjlQTmpMRFV6NHBkRFRfQWtVSVBtRlhKZkVWRjVQLWhiT0F2QVA5SWFlUGI0ai1ZdmlHWlNlNGxGeHdrQkk3Z2xYWFA4TEE4aXJjSVAwT24xallXSVdSM3c4T0l0VDNOQlBmTzJPem01eGd5Wkg0M25WaG9uRG5PbVc5ZG10c0xFd2hNTXZJMk1kaEIyWGFVMGxQZlpZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;If confirmed, it would be Washington’s first locally acquired infection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TACOMA, Wash. — Health officials are investigating what could be the first case of locally acquired malaria ever recorded in Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman in Pierce County who has not recently traveled was diagnosed with the disease Saturday and is receiving treatment, officials said. Her condition is being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While malaria infections are typically linked to travel, this case may have originated from within the state. The most likely scenario, officials say, is that a mosquito bit someone infected with a travel-related case of malaria and later transmitted the disease to the Pierce County patient.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This risk of getting infected with malaria in Pierce County remains very low,” said Dr. James Miller, Tacoma-Pierce County health officer. “Malaria is a rare disease overall in the United States — and the vast majority of cases in the United States occur following exposures in countries with ongoing transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department is working with the Washington State Department of Health to implement mosquito trapping and testing in the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington typically reports 20 to 70 malaria cases per year, all tied to travel. Nationally, the U.S. sees about 2,000 to 2,500 cases annually. Between May and October 2023, 10 locally acquired cases were reported in four states — the first such U.S. cases in 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaria is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, which live in parts of the United States. If they bite someone with an active malaria infection, they can pass the parasite to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaria can cause fever, chills, sweats and headaches. Other symptoms that can occur can affect gastrointestinal, respiratory, muscular, and neurological systems.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study that tracked the diets of more than 205,000 adults over decades, French fries were associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D), while other forms of potatoes—including baked, boiled, and mashed—were not. The study, led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health also found that swapping any form of potato for whole grains may lower the risk of T2D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;i&gt;BMJ&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, while previous studies hinted at a link between &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/potatoes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;potatoes&lt;/a&gt; and T2D, the evidence was inconsistent and often lacked detail on cooking methods and the potential effects of substituting other foods for potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study offers deeper, more comprehensive insights by looking at different types of potatoes, tracking diet over decades, and exploring the effects of swapping potatoes for other foods," said lead author Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're shifting the conversation from, 'Are potatoes good or bad?' to a more nuanced—and useful—question: How are they prepared, and what might we eat instead?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the diets and diabetes outcomes of 205,107 men and women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, participants regularly responded to dietary questionnaires, detailing the frequency with which they consumed certain foods, including French fries; baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes; and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/whole+grains/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also reported on new health diagnoses, including T2D, and various other health, lifestyle, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/demographic+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;demographic factors&lt;/a&gt;, which the researchers controlled for. Over the course of the study period, 22,299 participants reported that they developed T2D.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study found that three servings weekly of French fries increased the risk of developing T2D by 20%. Baked, boiled, and mashed potatoes were not significantly associated with T2D risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers calculated, however, that eating whole grains—such as whole grain pasta, bread, or farro—in place of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes could reduce the risk of T2D by 4%. Replacing French fries with whole grains could bring T2D risk down by 19%. Even swapping refined grains for French fries was estimated to lower T2D risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers complemented their study with a novel meta-analytic approach to estimate how swapping potatoes for whole grains could affect the risk of T2D, using data from previously published &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cohort+studies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cohort studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involved two separate meta-analyses: one based on data from 13 cohorts examining potato intake and the other from 11 cohorts on whole grain intake, each encompassing over 500,000 participants and 43,000 T2D diagnoses across four continents. The results were closely consistent with those of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The public health message here is simple and powerful: small changes in our daily diet can have an important impact on the risk of type 2 diabetes. Limiting potatoes—especially limiting French fries—and choosing healthy, whole-grain sources of carbohydrate could help lower the risk of type 2 diabetes across the population," said corresponding author Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For policymakers, our findings highlight the need to move beyond broad food categories and pay closer attention to how foods are prepared and what they're replacing. Not all carbs—or even all potatoes—are created equal, and that distinction is crucial when it comes to shaping effective dietary guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;

Dunking your spuds in a deep fryer might be a recipe for elevating your risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ac8c8" class="body-graf"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2024-082121" target="_blank"&gt;study published Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal BMJ, swapping out your weekly dose of frites for boiled, baked or mashed potatoes could lower your risk of this chronic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b33060" class="body-graf"&gt;The authors examined the diets of more than 205,000 adults in the U.S. who responded to questionnaires about what they ate over nearly four decades. Among those who consumed potatoes, the authors looked at which people developed Type 2 diabetes, a disease that leads to persistently high blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3f12bf" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating three weekly servings of french fries, they found, was associated with a 20% increased risk of Type 2 diabetes. But consuming the same amount of boiled, baked or mashed potatoes did not appear to be linked to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-467012" class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_blank"&gt;vast majority&lt;/a&gt; of the 1 in 10 people with diabetes in the U.S. have Type 2. The condition can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes or kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd5fd2" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings underscore that the way foods are prepared is key to their overall health risks or benefits, said Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, the study’s lead author and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-575681" class="body-graf"&gt;“Not all potatoes are created equal,” he said. “Even a small amount of french fries, less than one serving in the week, is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd1aa6" class="body-graf"&gt;Unlike boiled or baked potatoes, french fries are deep-fried in oils that usually contain trans or saturated fats. The way the body metabolizes those fats can contribute to insulin resistance — when cells don’t respond properly to insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar. Regular consumption of fried foods can also lead to obesity and inflammation, both of which raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-796089" class="body-graf"&gt;“When you fry the potatoes, the energy content — calories — increases because of the fat they absorb. If you eat many servings of french fries, it predisposes [people] to weight gain,” said Candida Rebello, the director of the nutrition and chronic disease program at Louisiana State University, who wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-32bfdd" class="body-graf"&gt;The study relied on data collected&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;between 1984 and 2021, when several different frying methods were popular. Most fast-food chains today prepare fries using vegetable oils like canola, sunflower, soybean or peanut oil. But during the 1980s, beef tallow was common. And in the early 1990s, restaurants shifted to partially hydrogenated oils. (The oils were a major source of trans fat in the U.S. diet and were &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat" target="_blank"&gt;largely phased out of the food industry&lt;/a&gt; by 2018.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-65f377" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/seed-oil-what-know-tiktok-explained-rcna186659" target="_blank"&gt;the seed oils used today &lt;/a&gt;are &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1848499491151745180?mx=2" target="_blank"&gt;“poisoning” Americans&lt;/a&gt; and contributing to high levels of obesity in children. He has advocated for restaurants to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-first-month-health-secretary-vaccines-food-additives-rcna196042" target="_blank"&gt;switch back to beef tallow&lt;/a&gt;, a recommendation that isn’t backed by scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a1dcc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Beef tallow is high in saturated fats and other harmful fats. We definitely don’t recommend that,” Mousavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b178ca" class="body-graf"&gt;One limitation of Mousavi’s study is that it did not account for people adding unhealthy ingredients to their boiled, baked or mashed potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-032502" class="body-graf"&gt;“What do people add to baked potatoes? Butter, bacon, cheese, sour cream,” said Shannon Galyean, an assistant professor of nutritional sciences at Texas Tech University, who wasn’t part of the research. “Then we also don’t know, did they eat it with the skins?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cb1a43" class="body-graf"&gt;Galyean said potato skins contain nutrients such as fiber, which helps with blood sugar control. And potatoes, when they aren’t deep-fried or slathered in butter, can be a useful source of potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-289a33" class="body-graf"&gt;“Definitely, potatoes can be considered a healthy food when you don’t fry it, or when you don’t add lots of fat to it,” Galyean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc4ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Mousavi said baking french fries at home with a healthier oil, such as olive or avocado oil, could help lower one’s diabetes risk compared to eating them from fast-food restaurants. Swapping out potatoes with whole grains, such as farro or whole-grain bread or pasta, could make an even bigger difference. These foods have a lower glycemic index, meaning they’re less likely to spike blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2ea229" class="body-graf"&gt;His study found that whole grains, when compared to all types of potatoes, were less likely to elevate one’s diabetes risk. White rice, on the other hand, had a stronger association with Type 2 diabetes than either of these foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6312b2" class="body-graf"&gt;Megan Mulcahy, the director of communications at Potatoes USA, a marketing and research organization that supports potato consumption, said fries can “absolutely be part of a healthy eating pattern when enjoyed in moderation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b5bd44" class="body-graf"&gt;Galyean said it’s important to consider a person’s overall diet, which has a greater impact on their health than any individual food. Nutritionists generally recommend a colorful plate with a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy proteins such as fish, beans or nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e31aa" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“People don’t eat just one thing; they eat meals,” Galyean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOYkxLY3lfMU4tYTZoMEJZOUhmdVJpLWxlU1d2WXA0RTdGZ2VacGItU29JTkRESXAyZFlrcmwxeGZLNlUzU0FHa01nUWpvWFpIeFdoUXhvNDhRbVk5VHEycnJxeFZzMFp3QUdGZngwSDQwb2dvQkFmRWNFbDFGU3F1aHVCSjVHLUYzOGFTT0cyeUgzRDBLeGF2NkxTeXVIclYzaU5XNjVvOEd3THc5dmhHOXpB0gFWQVVfeXFMTmtOQzJGTWo4MGJxTVJsLXlaRVJTQndBZUtXMHA2MmN4ZXhDYnNVZ01kWHVuUHJ1eG9YLURqb1hsSXRuVzVucjFwRmZmV0JJbjFBQjBKQ3c</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，经常吃薯片会使患2型糖尿病的风险增加20% --《卫报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQVnhnZ213UlpubUdmakNMTFo2eXYwNmRKRE5TLWgyNy1SR2tHZzZOQ09KNmZ4cWpuRzdlUUYyWjNDMURCaHJPVTJFZHZwWnhaMU85dU1PSjJSRi1IOHUyNXJqNjdVZVJTdnNudTVoYWlxMW5Hdy1iS1J6UTRKMEF4S3NsWUpJT0dVSGh2ejYyU3VEMF8xMVVaeVJYcTA5T2tQQUdJSU5NOHZEZGtydEFMYk5nanlBNU0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Love potatoes?

They based their findings on food questionnaires filled out by 205,000 health professionals in the US every four years between 1984 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Someone who eats chips three times a week was found to raise their risk of diabetes by 20%, but those who ate potatoes with the same regularity after baking, boiling or mashing them did so by only 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The high starch content of potatoes, leading to a high glycemic index and load, combined with possible loss of nutrients and possible health risks resulting from various cooking methods, could contribute to adverse health outcomes,” the study explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Replacing potatoes with whole grains lowers the risk of diabetes by 8%, and if grains are eaten instead of chips specifically, that cuts the risk by 19%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: “Potatoes can be part of a healthy diet, but it’s how we prepare them that makes the difference. Boiled, baked or mashed potatoes are naturally low in fat and a source of fibre, vitamin C and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But when we deep fry them into chips or french fries, especially in large portions and with added salt, they become less healthy with their high-fat, salt and calorie content that’s much more likely to contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, replacing any form of potatoes with white rice is a bad idea as it leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, the paper found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Hashem added: “This research reinforces the simple message, which is to enjoy potatoes – just don’t rely on chips as your go-to option. And, where possible, try swapping them out for whole grains like brown rice, bulgur wheat, wholemeal pasta or even sweet potato with skin on, which are healthier and protective for long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers stressed their findings were observational and did not prove a cause and effect relationship between eating chips and type 2 diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Food Standards Agency and Department of Health and Social Care both declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQVnhnZ213UlpubUdmakNMTFo2eXYwNmRKRE5TLWgyNy1SR2tHZzZOQ09KNmZ4cWpuRzdlUUYyWjNDMURCaHJPVTJFZHZwWnhaMU85dU1PSjJSRi1IOHUyNXJqNjdVZVJTdnNudTVoYWlxMW5Hdy1iS1J6UTRKMEF4S3NsWUpJT0dVSGh2ejYyU3VEMF8xMVVaeVJYcTA5T2tQQUdJSU5NOHZEZGtydEFMYk5nanlBNU0</guid></item><item><title>我们对纽约军团病爆发的了解-切割</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOMC0xc1RiSEtjaDFLbjd3Y0NHVUx2MTNINDVGd3RHemVabDVJNHRjdnVxdi1vNTI0QnNKcjBuYUJTcTVQalFzbEVJMl9meVMyRWRrTy1HYWl3cTEzdDl4d1pWYzJfbTAyTk9pcnFMTTBCZnNHOFI3bHJYZ2dpajA2VXkxSy10RnBYNW1sTDIzaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

Per the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/causes/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the disease, a type of pneumonia that presents with flulike symptoms, is caused by bacteria that often spreads through manmade water systems and standing water. Here’s what we know.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsen6001z3b78wg1ugm1h@published" data-word-count="62"&gt;Legionnaires’ is caused by a bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;. There are several strains of it, some of which cause Pontiac fever (a related but less severe version of Legionnaire’s) or don’t cause symptoms at all. The strain that causes Legionnaires’ disease is especially dangerous because of the way it infects the body by invading human cells, using their nutrients to grow and spread.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0h2sly000i3b78pqs0l7jt@published" data-word-count="139"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt; lives in pretty much any water system,” says Dr. Michael Phillips, the &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1699845974/michael-s-phillips"&gt;chief epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt; at NYU Langone Health, and it is often found on the inside surface of pipes and water tanks. Dr. Bernard Camins, the medical director for infection prevention at the Mount Sinai health system, says the bacteria often spreads through infected water supplies like a building’s boiler, a city water tank, or cooling towers, the mechanical systems that large buildings use to force hot air out. After a severe &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2015/09/1-dead-13-sick-in-recent-legionnaires-wave.html"&gt;2015 outbreak in the Bronx&lt;/a&gt; that killed 13 people, New York City passed a &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/business/permits-and-licenses/cooling-towers.page"&gt;local law&lt;/a&gt; requiring the owners of buildings with cooling towers to register, maintain, and test their systems, which is typically done by adding chlorine. That policy may not have prevented this outbreak, but increased testing is likely the reason it was caught early.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gset900213b78n29tc8tc@published" data-word-count="106"&gt;For the most part, &lt;em&gt;Legionella &lt;/em&gt; is present in water systems at fairly low levels, but it becomes more common in warmer months when water temperatures increase, since the bacteria proliferate in warm, shallow water. Though the numbers we’re seeing in the current outbreak are concerning, Dr. Camins says physicians get warnings about the disease from the Department of Health ahead of every summer. “It will continue to happen annually,” he explains. “In this situation, we’re more concerned because multiple people are being affected; it’s usually just single patients, so we definitely know that a common source is affecting a lot more people than we would like.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsevc00223b781jcy28ok@published" data-word-count="111"&gt;The New York &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/06/nyregion/legionnaires-disease-outbreak-harlem-new-york.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the bacteria has been detected in 11 cooling towers in Central Harlem in the past few days, which are most likely spreading the disease via water vapor. In large buildings, &lt;a href="https://paramount-mech.com/resources/what-is-a-cooling-tower-used-for-in-commercial-buildings-manassas-va-washington-dc/"&gt;cooling towers&lt;/a&gt; stop a building from getting too hot by expelling the heat into the atmosphere via evaporation. “Many of these have fans on top of them and they’re basically blowing these aerosols,” explains Dr. Phillips. The problem is, those aerosols can contain &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;. That also means the disease does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; spread from person to person. According to Dr. Phillips, “You don’t generate enough aerosol, as a person who’s sick, to make somebody else sick.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gseyv00233b78lvrhh67w@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;In short, look out for all the usual flulike symptoms that come with pneumonia and other respiratory illnesses: A dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. Dr. Camins says that with Legionaires’ disease specifically, you’re more likely to experience nausea and other GI issues.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsf1800243b78wrszwlsk@published" data-word-count="48"&gt;Dr. Phillips says that because of the unique way it attacks the cells, Legionnaires’ tends to be a particularly severe form of pneumonia. That’s why, he says, so many people end up hospitalized, and the mortality rate can be as high as 10 percent during a given outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsf4k00253b78wg38cccr@published" data-word-count="83"&gt;Since the bacteria specifically spreads from water source to person, outbreaks like this one are pretty strictly geographic, says Dr. Phillips. The &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/legionnaires-disease.page"&gt;department of health&lt;/a&gt; has listed five Zip Codes in Central Harlem that are currently affected: 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037, and 10039. But beyond that, the patients with the highest risk are those who are immunocompromised or have other comorbidities. Dr. Camins says smokers, people with lung cancer or lung disease, or over the age of 50 are at a higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsf7b00263b7835zmcbal@published" data-word-count="26"&gt;Still, Dr. Phillips recommends that “anybody, particularly in the Zip Codes of concern,” get checked out if they’re experiencing “fever, cough, [or] feeling like they have the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cme0gsfa300273b78gc8m9mq2@published" data-word-count="53"&gt;Dr. Phillips also says that certain medications can affect immunity, including those that treat inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. “There’s many more patients taking those drugs now than even there was ten years ago,” he explains. “That’s a population that could get Legionnaires’ more severely and certainly should be on guard for symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;

Yankner, a professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, reported that they were able to reverse the disease in mice and restore brain function with small amounts of the compound lithium orotate, enough to mimic the metal’s natural level in the brain. Their study appeared Wednesday in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EB4MSG4DZNC4HHYF3XTPKBP6HE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The obvious impact is that because lithium orotate is dirt cheap, hopefully we will get rigorous, randomized trials testing this very, very quickly,” said Matt Kaeberlein, former director of the Healthy Aging and Longevity Research Institute at the University of Washington, who did not participate in the study.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“And I would say that it will be an embarrassment to the Alzheimer’s clinical community if that doesn’t happen right away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QXKVHM6ZRJB55LJK27E4ELPV64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yankner, who is also the co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at Harvard, said: “I do not recommend that people take lithium at this point, because it has not been validated as a treatment in humans. We always have to be cautious because things can change as you go from mice to humans.” He added that the findings still need to be validated by other labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DHATDXAVV5HCPCBXRVXYPZ5DLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although there have been recent breakthroughs in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, no medication has succeeded in stopping or reversing the disease that afflicts more than 7 million Americans, a number projected to reach almost 13 million by 2050, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures?utm_source=google-grant&amp;amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google_grant&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=42054366&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqKzEBhANEiwAeQaPVUjBaDn58VEfdFkEC4B0qUR6WsJTK8H1CbpNhyX3SHj3bahuhKGLnRoCSTQQAvD_BwE#quickFacts" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYH2DMX3SNDVBDM2AAVDEW33MU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lithium is widely prescribed for patients with bipolar disorder, and previous research indicated that it held potential as an Alzheimer’s treatment and an antiaging medication. A 2017 study in Denmark suggested the presence of lithium in drinking water  might be associated with a lower incidence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K66TNJRMKJBZLLBJJHQFOOUFSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, the new work is the first to describe the specific roles that lithium plays in the brain, its influence on all of the brain’s major cell types and the effect that its deficiency later in life has on aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3AUKWROFEBFKJN6A4UUPUIE5TE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Results of the study by Yankner’s lab and researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center in Chicago also suggest that measuring lithium levels might help doctors screen people for signs of Alzheimer’s years before the first symptoms begin to appear. Yankner said doctors might be able to measure lithium levels in the cerebrospinal fluid or blood, or through brain imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="K6Q5YHXHXBAABPH5QPH5WAQS24" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="K6Q5YHXHXBAABPH5QPH5WAQS24" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How our brains use lithium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EH3BMV6SIZHYNNEKL3ZKYE3JHE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a healthy brain, lithium maintains the connections and communication lines that allow neurons to talk with one another.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have conducted the largest-ever genetic analysis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a typically lifelong condition that affects people's ability to exert physical effort and can be debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="brdx-unit-1" class="brdx-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.decodeme.org.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.decodeme.org.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DecodeME study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which recruited over 15,000 people of European ancestry with the condition, revealed that eight stretches of the genome were tied to the syndrome. These had not previously been linked to ME/CFS. The gene variants found in these locations are also found in some healthy individuals, the research suggests. But in people with ME/CFS, the variants are likely to act alongside environmental factors to increase people's risk of the condition, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings "provide the first robust evidence for genetic contributions to ME risk," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/chris-ponting" target="_blank" data-url="https://edwebprofiles.ed.ac.uk/profile/chris-ponting" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chris Ponting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioinformatician at the University of Edinburgh, said at a news conference Wednesday (Aug. 6).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study has been released as a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/initial-findings-from-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;preprint &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;by the University of Edinburgh and has not been peer-reviewed yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="brdx-unit-2" class="brdx-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimates suggest ME/CFS may affect &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434940/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10434940/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;67 million people worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, although the exact prevalence is uncertain and research into how the disease manifests and how to treat it has been glacially slow. This is partly because of disputes in the field about what characterizes the disease's key symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, leading psychiatrists &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482658/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482658/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;positioned ME/CFS as a psychological condition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These discredited theories suggested that the syndrome — whose symptoms include &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-brain-fog" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-brain-fog"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain fog&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fatigue that is not relieved by rest, and chronic pain — was driven by patients' mental states and lack of exercise. These ideas emerged, in part, because the few clinical investigations done on ME/CFS could not pinpoint biological changes tied to the syndrome or a clear trigger for the observed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/it-took-the-rug-right-out-from-under-my-life-milestone-mecfs-study-begins-to-explain-disease-but-will-it-lead-to-treatments" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/it-took-the-rug-right-out-from-under-my-life-milestone-mecfs-study-begins-to-explain-disease-but-will-it-lead-to-treatments"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'It took the rug right out from under my life': Milestone ME/CFS study begins to explain disease, but will it lead to treatments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qnoZnZEj9rBHf3ry85zC8D" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qnoZnZEj9rBHf3ry85zC8D slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the new work adds to mounting evidence that links the condition to dysfunction in the nervous and immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings will provide credibility and validity to the experience of people with ME," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.actionforme.org.uk/people/sonya-chowdhury/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.actionforme.org.uk/people/sonya-chowdhury/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sonya Chowdhury&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of the ME/CFS charity Action for M.E., said at the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DecodeME involved genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which are genetic analyses that look for links between common variations in the genome and other traits, such as the presence of a given disease. The study conducted two separate GWAS on about 15,600 ME/CFS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients' genomes were compared with those of people without ME/CFS whose genetic information was previously recorded in the UK Biobank, which includes data from 500,000 U.K. adults. Together, the two GWAS identified eight loci — locations in the genome — that were strongly associated with whether or not a person had ME/CFS. At these key locations, they marked out the genes most likely to influence a person’s risk of developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These genes included several linked to immune function. One was &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BTN2A2" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BTN2A2" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BTN2A2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which a previous study showed could &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_7812213842204848684&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-021-98443-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhuge-study-of-me-cfs-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-the-debilitating-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-98443-5" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-021-98443-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhuge-study-of-me-cfs-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-the-debilitating-syndrome" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influence the function of T cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are key to fighting germs.

The authors say this link may help to explain ME/CFS patients' hypersensitivity to light, sound and touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic links do not reflect changes wrought by the disease — instead, they hint at the biological systems that influence how vulnerable people are to developing ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors made some efforts to replicate their data by looking at whether these same associations could be drawn using 13,800 ME/CFS cases recorded in the UK Biobank and in the Netherlands' Lifelines database, another large cohort study. However, after statistical correction, none of the associations were replicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This may reflect poor or inconsistent diagnosis data in those other datasets, rather than flaws in the DecodeME findings themselves," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-amy-mason" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.phpc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-amy-mason" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Amy Mason&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research associate at the University of Cambridge who was not involved with the study, told the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-unpublished-preprint-on-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-me-cfs/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-unpublished-preprint-on-the-decodeme-genome-wide-association-study-of-me-cfs/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.K. Science Media Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Long COVID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a long-lasting condition that emerges after a COVID-19 infection and affects many systems in the body — has been noted to share &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-mecfs-and-the-importance-of-studying-infection-associated-illnesses" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/long-covid-mecfs-and-the-importance-of-studying-infection-associated-illnesses" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;symptoms with ME/CFS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, DecodeME didn't identify any of the same genetic signals found in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1774242947088305846&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41588-025-02100-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhuge-study-of-me-cfs-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-the-debilitating-syndrome" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02100-w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41588-025-02100-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fhuge-study-of-me-cfs-reveals-genetic-hotspots-linked-to-the-debilitating-syndrome" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;similarly sized GWAS analysis of long COVID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year, Ponting said.

The DecodeME study didn't identify any strong sex links, but Mason pointed out that the team did not look at the X or Y chromosomes, where &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Sex-Linked" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Sex-Linked" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sex-linked traits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might be found. The analysis also focused entirely on people of European descent, which may limit its value towards patients from other ancestries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope that DecodeME will be a jumping-off point for further research, which could explore the genetic signals in more detail and pinpoint the biological mechanisms they suggest are involved in ME/CFS. For now, the findings cannot advance diagnostics or screening for the condition, Ponting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an urgent need for studies that target these regions that dig down … to determine why each of these signals is linked to ME," he said, "so that we cannot just move towards, but accelerate towards, future diagnostics and treatments."&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/11/trump-stephen-hahn-fda-covid-vaccine/"&gt;first covid shots&lt;/a&gt;, based on mRNA, were in people’s arms less than a year after the United States recorded its first coronavirus case — a signature achievement of the first Trump administration. The flexible technology provided a road map for how to quickly respond to pathogens that are constantly evolving, including H5N1 avian bird flu, a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2024/12/05/bird-flu-mutation-human-cells-new-research/"&gt;candidate to&lt;/a&gt; spark the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q49NV8HZU138DBD44AHBZEA9PG" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But research into H5N1 mRNA vaccines were among nearly two dozen mRNA projects supported by the government’s biodefense agency that were terminated or altered, according to a Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released Tuesday. The moves affect $500 million in projects, according to HHS, including covid and flu therapeutics and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XEMX30WGQH0M94JBA6FJU51YY0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“This represents a significant setback for our preparedness efforts in responding to infectious-disease outbreaks,” said Dawn O’Connell, the former assistant secretary of preparedness and response at HHS during the Biden administration.

      &lt;p&gt;Most of us have heard you need 10,000 steps a day to stave off health problems, but new research is finding that number is not necessary — though more is always better.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="transcript storytext" aria-label="Transcript"&gt;
    &lt;b class="icn-story-transcript-wrap"&gt;

    &lt;/b&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; How many steps should you take in one day? I mean, many of us have heard 10,000 is the number to aim for, but that was never based on solid science. Researchers have combed through the data and they've come up with a more accurate target. NPR's Will Stone has more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILL STONE, BYLINE: Scientists have made big strides in the science of step taking in recent years. Melody Ding is an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney. She says the technology for counting is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MELODY DING: It's hard not to track it because there are so many devices, you know, like wearables, our phone. It all tells us, you know, roughly how many steps we take every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: So when Ding set out to update the physical activity guidelines for Australia, she ended up taking on a massive review of the evidence, analyzing data from 160,000 adults on the link between their daily step count and the risk of dying, cancer, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and dementia. Ding says they found the sweet spot hovers around 7,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DING: The 7,000 steps tend to be the range where there seems to be diminishing return on investment for increasing more steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: In other words, 10,000 or even 12,000 steps did not significantly reduce your health risk beyond what you'd already get from reaching 7,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DING: So the risk will still continue to go down for some of the outcomes beyond 7,000, but the added benefits become smaller and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Another big takeaway - they found sizable benefits for any steps above the bare minimum of 2,000. For example, doubling that to 4,000 was associated with a 36% lower risk of dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DING: That's message No. 1 from the study - any steps is good, even when you're at low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: They also checked if speed made a difference, but Ding says, here, they couldn't make any definitive conclusions. The study was published in the journal Lancet Public Health, and it echoes what Amanda Paluch has seen in her own research. Paluch is a physical activity epidemiologist at UMass Amherst. She says they've noticed age makes a difference, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AMANDA PALUCH: We were seeing that older adults did not seem to need as many steps compared to younger adults. So older adults older than 60, the kind of the range where we started to see that plateau was six to eight for an older adult versus eight to 10 for a younger adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Paluch likes this new research in the Lancet, but cautions some of the findings are preliminary because they're not yet based on many studies. Dr. William Kraus, a cardiologist and researcher at Duke, worked on the 2018 U.S. Physical Activity Guidelines. He'd love to see step count targets be included one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WILLIAM KRAUS: Because they're objective measures, right? Everybody has a phone now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: The current guidelines recommend at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week for adults. Kraus says time spent exercising or taking steps ultimately reflects the same thing - the link between health and energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KRAUS: Because anything is better than nothing, more is better than less. That's what the evidence says, right? So everybody wants to know how little I need to do. That is the wrong question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Because if you aim for the high end, you will maximize your chances of getting the most benefits, even if those are incremental. And there's another reason to do extra - all that time spent in a chair. While it wasn't part of this new study, Kraus says past research shows you need to aim higher than 7,000 or even 10,000 if you spend eight hours a day sitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KRAUS: If you get 13,000 steps, you get the same thing as somebody who doesn't sit. Which if they don't sit, that means they're getting steps, right? If you're not sitting, you're doing something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Though Kraus says there's nothing magic about steps. You can convert miles to swimming or cycling. Melody Ding at the University of Sydney says she likes to think of movement in the same way as diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DING: Just like we need a balanced, healthy diet, it's important for us to have balanced physical activity, training throughout the week as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STONE: Get those steps, but also make time for mobility and strength training. All of it adds up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Stone, NPR News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about using a CPAP machine to quell sleep apnea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not necessarily a good idea for everyone, a new evidence review argues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This common treatment for sleep apnea might increase some folks' risk of heart attack, stroke and heart-related death, according to results published today in the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf447" target="_blank"&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CPAP machines can dramatically lower a person's heart risk if severe sleep apnea causes dramatic drops in blood oxygen levels or large surges in heart rate, researchers found by analyzing data from more than 3,500 participants in three major clinical trials.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But CPAP might escalate heart health risk among people with milder sleep apnea, particularly if the condition doesn't cause them to feel sleepy during the daytime, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that CPAP may offer long-term cardiovascular benefit in people with high-risk obstructive sleep apnea, but may have unintended harmful effects in those without high-risk OSA," lead researcher &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/ali-azarbarzin" target="_blank"&gt;Ali Azarbarzin&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep medicine investigator at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said in a news release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax, causing a person's airway to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These folks tend to snore, and if the airway collapses completely their breathing can start and stop throughout the night, causing them to repeatedly wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous positive airway pressure machines blow air through a face mask as a person sleeps. The air pressure prevents the person's airways from closing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea has been previously linked to &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cardiovascular-diseases/coronary-heart-disease-645474.html" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, researchers noted. It's been reported to increase the risk of heart failure by 140%, &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/stroke/stroke-what-it-is-types-symptoms-causes-risk-factors-treatment-prevention-2" target="_blank"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; by 60% and heart disease by 30%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prior studies of CPAP treatment for sleep apnea have not shown a clear benefit to heart health from the devices, Azarbarzin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to clarify CPAP's heart benefits, Azarbarzin and colleagues pooled together data from three separate trials that tested CPAP for people with sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed a clear benefit for people with high-risk sleep apnea that causes dramatic changes in blood oxygen and heart rate. Overall, these patients had a 17% lower risk of heart attack, stroke and heart-related death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in people without high-risk sleep apnea who don't feel sleepy during the day, CPAP appeared to increase their risk of serious heart problems by 30%, researchers said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For people with high-risk OSA, CPAP likely helps by preventing low oxygen levels and calming the overactive sympathetic nervous system during sleep," Azarbarzin said. Both are linked to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But in people without these high-risk markers, who are already at very low cardiovascular risk, CPAP seems to have downsides," Azarbarzin added. "While we don't really know why, one possibility is that the pressure used in CPAP may stretch the lungs in a way that puts stress on the cardiovascular system. Another is that CPAP could disturb sleep for some people, and sleep disruption itself is a risk factor for cardiovascular problems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results indicate the need for personalized treatment of sleep apnea, Azarbarzin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Instead of treating everyone the same, we should consider whether someone has high-risk features," Azarbarzin said. "These are the people who seem most likely to benefit from CPAP."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, more research is needed to better understand the potential risks posed by CPAP, Azarbarzin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CPAP-related harm was seen only in non-sleepy patients with existing heart disease, according to the design of trials analyzed in this study," Azarbarzin said. "Whether this applies to other patients remains unknown and needs further research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More information&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                A researcher works at the Moderna headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. In May the Trump administration pulled over $700 million committed to Moderna for developing future flu vaccines and this week it cancelled another $500 million in grants to various institutions researching mRNA vaccines.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is cancelling almost $500 million in contracts to develop mRNA vaccines to protect the nation against future viral threats. The move thrilled critics of the technology but horrified many public health and biosecurity experts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal &lt;a href="https://medicalcountermeasures.gov/barda" target="_blank"&gt;Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority&lt;/a&gt;, or BARDA, which oversees the nation's defenses against biological attacks, is terminating 22 contracts with university researchers and private companies to develop new uses for the mRNA technology, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology was used by the first Trump administration to create the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines, which are widely considered a medical triumph that safely and effectively saved millions of lives. But vaccine mandates during the pandemic sowed fierce antipathy towards the technology, leading to widespread public opposition.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants one," Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;explaining the&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt; decision&lt;/a&gt;. "That's why we're moving beyond the limitations of mRNA vaccines for respiratory viruses and investing in better solutions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The announcement dismayed many who study infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This may be the most dangerous public health judgment that I've seen in my 50 years in this business," says &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholdm-phd-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. "It is baseless and we will pay a tremendous price in terms of illnesses and deaths. I'm extremely worried about it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the decision was welcomed by vaccine critics like the group &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Children's Health Defense&lt;/a&gt;, which Kennedy himself founded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While we believe the mRNA vaccines should be taken off the market, the announcement is a positive move towards protecting public health," said Mary Holland, the group's president and CEO, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jnuzzo" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo&lt;/a&gt; strongly disagrees. She runs the Brown University School of Public Health Pandemic Center, and says the move could erode preparedness for future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a profoundly disappointing development," she says. "When there's the next pandemic, we're going to be caught flat-footed. It absolutely leaves the country vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Nuzzo and others aren't just worried about the next pandemic. Many experts say mRNA vaccines would provide a crucial deterrent and powerful defense against bioterrorists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think that it endangers the national security of the United States," says &lt;a href="https://www.raymondjames.com/corporations-and-institutions/global-equities-and-investment-banking/equity-research/equity-research-team/bio?id=4ee72beb8f904b708356c8e2867bf126&amp;amp;bioListId=39377c2ba1e4492a87cac2836d0838f6" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Meekins&lt;/a&gt;, a top biodefense official in the first Trump administration. "It could put the US at a strategic national security disadvantage and would be a significant threat to the national security of the United States."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In announcing his decision, Kennedy claimed the COVID-19 vaccines were unsafe, ineffective, helped drive the evolution of the virus and could not keep up with new mutations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"After reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA, HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits against these respiratory viruses," Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many outside experts say Kennedy's claims are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"His science is backwards, as it often is," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/peter-hotez-23229" target="_blank"&gt;Peter Hotez&lt;/a&gt;, the dean of the Baylor College of Medicine who runs the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development. "This is a proven technology for emerging respiratory viruses or respiratory virus pandemics. It is extremely safe and has been incredibly effective."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;mRNA vaccines work by stimulating the immune system with a key protein from a virus. Kennedy says the federal government is instead investing in an alternative technology that uses whole killed viruses and can produce "natural immunity."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While that technology has produced effective vaccines, it's a much older approach that can have safety issues and is not nearly as nimble in responding to new threats, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is irresponsible to strip funding from future technologies with great potential and shift it towards outdated old fashioned technologies," says &lt;a href="https://www.xprize.org/about/people/rick-bright" target="_blank"&gt;Rick Bright&lt;/a&gt;, who ran BARDA during the first Trump administration. "We're taking our country from 2025 back to 1940 and we all know that's a recipe for disaster and failure."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology is the only vaccine technology that can be developed quickly enough to respond swiftly to a new pathogenic threat, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In an outbreak, when you are facing a rapidly spreading virus – whether it's from nature or a nation-state adversary – speed is the name of the game," Bright says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna" target="_blank"&gt;previously cancelled&lt;/a&gt; a $766 million contract with the vaccine company Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect people against flu strains with pandemic potential.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many fear moves like this will continue to undermine public trust in vaccines generally and mRNA technology specifically, which is also showing promise for treating diseases, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08508-4" target="_blank"&gt;cancer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The deleterious impact is not only in the contracts that they're canceling but they're trying to make the case to the public that mRNA technology doesn't work very well and it's unsafe," Hotez says. "And that's absolutely untrue."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What I'm seeing in my own practice mirrors the surge my colleagues are reporting nationwide,' she told&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/well/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-symptoms-treatment.html"&gt; The New York Times. &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HFMD is caused by the virus coxsackievirus 16 and there is no vaccine for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be passed through the air or by coming into close contact with a person who hasn't washed their hands after using the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HFMD infections tend to spike in the summer and early fall because children are more likely to mix in environments where the disease can spread, such as at summer camps, pools and theme parks, as well as the start of school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies also suggest that warmer and more humid weather in the summer months may be more favorable for the survival and transmission of the viruses that cause HFMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HFMD typically causes fever, vomiting and a rash covering the mouth, hands and feet that clears up within 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in very young patients, the illness can be much more serious and lead to seizures, triggered by inflammation of the fluid surrounding the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is highly transmissible, spread via contact with fluids from an infected person, such as from blisters, and by swallowing infected water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that water parks can spread the highly contagious disease if their water has not been treated properly, leaving children at risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Philadelphia, a water park was&lt;span&gt; closed for a day in July after a child who had visited the location contracted HFMD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts warn that water parks can spread the highly contagious disease if their water has not been treated properly, leaving youngsters at risk of infection (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 10 to 15million cases of HFMD are recorded in the US every year, estimates suggest, mostly among children under five years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who are infected are recommended to take over-the-counter pain medications to help relieve fever and pain caused by mouth sores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are also told to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration, saying this may happen because mouth sores make it painful to swallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children diagnosed with the disease should avoid contact with others for at least seven days in order to dodge them spreading the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 18:37:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>纽约军团疫情蔓延导致三人死亡- Bloomberg.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxPMTVzeHBSV21DS2hfaW8xckR5bUNycU9rQ0s3NmZNdW5aZ2V4cTdsNlA1MDBOVmozMzFEaklzT0hJSTltSUdHRjNITjZrVVBfcU1iR1RuVjF2cWFWM1JUUzZpaXZXOWtqN2FOei1oM2NmRVYwWjIzeDVybEJtMHZPZG9qVFZEZ3dLZml1ZmFwTU91alFiYURGQXhlWENVVUQxdGhORmdlQ2w0ZWEtbkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="box main"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;(CNN)— &lt;/strong&gt;Think speeding up your metabolism is key to losing weight? Metabolism has grown into one of the biggest buzzwords in the wellness industry — a tricky code that, if deciphered, is believed to unlock the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/04/health/weight-loss-ultraprocessed-food-wellness"&gt;secrets of weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and overall health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz2wxup00003b6mu1389idy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the term’s ubiquity, one scientist says many people don’t understand much of how this basic bodily process works.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m0000w3b6mhlo8mv10@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They think it has something to do with how much food we can eat without gaining weight or something like that,” Dr. Kevin Hall told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m0000x3b6mahtpyshj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall wants to elevate metabolism for different reasons. “Metabolism is just this incredible biochemical process that basically turns the food that we eat and the oxygen that we breathe into essentially … everything we are and everything we do,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m0000y3b6m8ooen0kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A leading  nutrition and metabolism scientist, Hall is well-known  for his &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/03/health/biggest-loser-diet-exercise-study/index.html"&gt;research on contestants&lt;/a&gt;  from the reality show “The Biggest Loser” that helped explain what set participants who kept the weight off apart from those who gained it back.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m0000z3b6mqd1jjfnk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He spent more than two decades  at the National Institutes of Health. His later work on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/chasing-life/episodes/afe7b592-37bb-11ef-8219-ff42973edcce"&gt;ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; investigated its link to obesity, including &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; that demonstrated it actively caused participants to overeat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m000103b6m3f3gr1la@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall announced his early retirement and exit from NIH in April, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/health/nih-nutrition-researcher-departs"&gt;citing censorship&lt;/a&gt; of how his research findings were communicated. He’s now coauthor of the new book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Intelligence-Science-Nourishes-Harms/dp/059333230X/" target="_blank"&gt;Food Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;: The Science of How Food Both Nourishes and Harms Us” alongside journalist Julia Belluz.

            Metabolism and weight loss enter conversations arm in arm, but this, according to Hall, can be reductive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m000123b6msb0zr9ls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just find it incredibly frustrating sometimes that this idea of metabolism, this really beautiful physiological process that is so fundamental to life, is kind of talked about as, ‘Oh well, if you take this supplement, you can boost your metabolism and lose weight,’” he explained to Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3d6m000133b6m9qdm2enz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Is a faster or higher metabolism really the highway to weight loss? Hall is here to set the record straight, highlighting three misconceptions about metabolism that show there is more to it than meets the eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001e3b6myvmmn9ze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One common belief is that a slower metabolism results in a higher body weight. But mostly, Hall said, the opposite is true.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001f3b6m5xqqe1wz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Generally, larger people have faster metabolisms than smaller people,” he told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001g3b6m899xhll2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall attributed the pervasiveness of this myth to the way researchers designed early metabolism studies. Scientists initially tried to match up participants’ caloric intake to their weight, but they didn’t account for the fact that these calorie counts were self-reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001h3b6ma460jyzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It turned out that those with obesity often underreported the number of calories they ate to a larger degree than their leaner counterparts. This, Hall said, “led people to a conclusion that, well, if they’re eating less calories and they’re maintaining their weight, then they must be burning less calories. And maybe the reason why they have obesity is because they have slow metabolisms.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001i3b6mlp0785r3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Modern technology now allows researchers to rely on data, not participants’ own reports. “When we actually directly measure people’s metabolisms, people with obesity have higher metabolic rates on average than people who are lean,” Hall noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001j3b6msbog7o2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the myth that we should be boosting metabolism to treat obesity has stubbornly persisted — and has at times led to deadly consequences. When Stanford University researchers discovered that the chemical compound 2,4-dinitrophenol, or DNP, increased metabolism levels in the 1930s, they enthusiastically promoted it as a safe and effective tool for treating obesity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001k3b6mt45b757p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While DNP did boost metabolism, it also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3550200/" target="_blank"&gt;led to side effects&lt;/a&gt; that included blindness and death, causing federal drug regulators to quickly withdraw it from the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001l3b6m19uwfrjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Maybe,” Hall suggested, “it shouldn’t be too much of a surprise later to realize that with something so fundamentally important to life as metabolism, you can’t just turn it up and turn it down with a pharmaceutical drug and not expect some pretty severe side effects, including death.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001m3b6mzk6u7ojq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like weight, age might not affect metabolism as much as you may assume.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001n3b6me1wuuol2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It turns out that until you get to very advanced ages, we’re talking 70s and 80s, it looks like our metabolic rate is roughly constant,” Hall said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001o3b6ms1qin2jd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are, of course, changes in the aging body that can impact metabolic rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001p3b6mladievcp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People “past the age of 30 or so,” Hall said, are “tending to lose muscle mass or tending to lose lean mass, and they’re tending to gain fat mass. And that alone is anticipated to result in a lower metabolism.” That’s because lean muscle burns more calories than fat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001q3b6mmw1peqrb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it’s these age-related changes — that are not inevitable — and not age itself, that influence one’s metabolism.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001r3b6mk6i2e0i5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Once you get rid of that effect … it doesn’t seem like there’s a fundamental aging effect to slow metabolism as, as we get older,” Hall concluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001s3b6mq1im4tbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A couple ways to combat the loss of lean muscle mass as you age is by engaging in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/21/health/exercises-for-aging-bodies-wellness"&gt;twice-a-week strength training&lt;/a&gt; and getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/15/health/how-to-eat-more-protein-diet-wellness"&gt;protein in your diet&lt;/a&gt; (but no need to go overboard).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001t3b6m9tmzsxao@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another pillar of metabolism mythology is the idea that a slow metabolism is the enemy of continued weight loss. Interventions such as dieting are believed to slow metabolism to the point that you can’t lose any additional weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001u3b6m5ipjwdx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But keeping your metabolism from slowing down isn’t the key to sustained weight loss, Hall said. In fact, it’s just the opposite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001v3b6m6xflfoct@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The people who are most successful at losing weight and keeping it off are the ones who sport the slowest metabolisms or the greatest reductions in metabolism,” he said. “It’s kind of like stretching a spring, right?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001w3b6murqlyx8e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The more intensely someone diets or exercises, the more weight they’ll lose and the more their metabolism will slow down, he explained in his book.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001x3b6mjhsus8kr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hall’s research showed that a slower metabolism “didn’t seem to determine anyone’s ability to lose weight or keep it off in the short or long run.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdz3g9w5001y3b6mzey7r2qc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By uncoupling metabolism from the weight loss conversation, Hall said he hopes everyone can appreciate the phenomenon for what it really is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Misinformation about metabolism “has really distracted people, I think, from the real beauty of what this is,” he told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “It’s harnessing the continuous flow of matter and energy in our food and in our breath and powering every cell in our body, as well as the bodies and cells of practically every organism that we have ever encountered,” Hall said. “It’s a fundamental component of life, and it’s just incredibly fascinating.”

    &lt;p&gt;A genetic cause for &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/chronic-fatigue/"&gt;ME&lt;/a&gt; has been found for the first time, proving the illness is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a breakthrough that charities said finally provided “credibility and validity” for sufferers, the University of Edinburgh found eight areas of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/06/26/human-genetic-code-built-from-scratch-genome-science/"&gt;genetic code&lt;/a&gt; that make a diagnosis more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene activity was seen mainly in the nervous and immune systems, suggesting that people with ME may struggle to clear infections and experience ongoing symptoms of pain, fatigue and illness that other people recover from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonya Chowdhury, co-investigator on the study and chief executive of Action for ME, said: “For years, many people have been maligned and disbelieved, and our findings will change this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that many people have experienced comments like ‘ME’s not real’. They’ve been to doctors and told that it’s not a real illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to take this study into the treatment room and to say there are genetic causes that play a part in ME is going to be really significant. It will rebuff that lack of belief and stigma that exists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ME, or myalgic encephalomyelitis – which is often known as chronic fatigue syndrome – is a long-term illness characterised by extreme fatigue that is not relieved by rest, and may bring malaise after exercise, sleep problems, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-b12-deficiency/"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt; and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

	The Department of Health and Human Services has announced that it will be ending its mRNA &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccine/" id="auto-tag_vaccine" data-tag="vaccine"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; development program, and former Surgeon General Jerome Adams is warning that “this move is going to cost lives.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; released on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/hhs/" id="auto-tag_hhs" data-tag="hhs"&gt;HHS&lt;/a&gt; Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-skepticism-fox-news-1235294291/"&gt;conspiracy theorist&lt;/a&gt;, informed the public that the department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) had “begun canceling” 22 mRNA vaccine development investments. The contracts being canceled are worth $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy claimed that mRNA technology, which uses synthetic gene sequences to teach cells how to create antibodies without needing to introduce viral particles, doesn’t “perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract,” such as Covid-19. Kennedy went on to assert that mRNA &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccines/" id="auto-tag_vaccines" data-tag="vaccines"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; “can actually prolong pandemics as the virus constantly mutates to escape the protective effects of the vaccine.” 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“We’re prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies like whole virus vaccines and novel platforms that don’t collapse when viruses mutate,” Kennedy said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Unsurprisingly, Kennedy is misleading the public about the science behind vaccines. A 2023 study published &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10588549/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;by the National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt; on the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against Covid found that “despite certain drawbacks such as strong immunogenicity and the potential for triggering irrelevant immune responses, the authorized mRNA vaccines are considered highly effective and safe.” 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general for the bulk of President Donald Trump’s first term, &lt;a href="https://x.com/JeromeAdamsMD/status/1952905490662629640" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wrote on X&lt;/a&gt; that while he has “tried to be objective and non-alarmist” about recent decisions made at HHS under Kennedy, “quite frankly this move is going to cost lives.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“mRNA technology has uses that go far beyond vaccines … and the vaccine they helped develop in record time is credited with saving millions,” Adams wrote. 



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy has waged a full-fledged war against the nation’s vaccination infrastructure since his confirmation to Trump’s Cabinet. The secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/top-fda-vaccine-official-resigns-rfk-jr-misinformation-1235306330/"&gt;downplayed the severity&lt;/a&gt; of a deadly measles outbreak in Texas — a disease that had almost been eliminated by robust public vaccination programs. In June, he &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-fires-cdc-vaccine-panel-1235360211/"&gt;fired an entire panel&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine experts tasked with helping shape seasonal vaccine recommendations, and replaced them with loyalists and ideologues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The health secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-medical-advice-1235339307/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a House Appropriations Committee hearing in May that he didn’t “think people should be taking medical advice from me.” Unfortunately for the nation, the danger lies not just in Kennedy’s dismissible advice, but in his ignorance of science as he destroys the nation’s health systems, and the devastating consequences the teardown could have on Americans’ health. &lt;/p&gt;

            Texas hasn’t reported a new outbreak-related measles case in nearly a month — a hopeful sign that one of the largest outbreaks the United States has seen in decades is starting to slow. But the measles threat hasn’t faded as new outbreaks and growing case counts in other states add to the national tally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h200053b6ntzsg9egr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been more measles cases reported in the US in the past month – at least 89 confirmed cases since the start of July – than in most years since the disease was declared eliminated a quarter century ago, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h200063b6nfrlvmums@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And this year’s total – 1,356 confirmed cases since January – is higher than it’s been in more than 30 years. There have been 32 outbreaks this year, accounting for nearly 90% of all cases since January. Only 10 states remain at zero cases reported this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzsp5j00003b6nt83w4zjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The start of the school year in the US poses new threats for the spread of measles amid a record-breaking year for cases and lagging vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h200073b6nub03raor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that declining childhood vaccination rates across the US coupled with ongoing spread of measles in the US – and large outbreaks in neighboring Canada and Mexico – have raised concerns as children start to gather for the new school year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzfpet00003b6n6koqqlzx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Nobody has a crystal ball, but the conditions are there to see an increased number of cases,” said Dr. Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h200093b6n6a8cpwu3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Saturday, Wisconsin &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/080225.htm" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; nine new cases – all linked to the same exposure during travel to another US state. The state health department isn’t releasing more details about the cases – including the vaccination status of the individuals or the specific state they traveled to – in order to “balance individual privacy for what the public needs to know” and because the risk of community spread is considered to be low, Dr. Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer in the Wisconsin Department of Health Services Bureau of Communicable Diseases, said at a news briefing on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000a3b6nklu8l9tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;new data published by the CDC last week&lt;/a&gt; shows that kindergartners in Wisconsin had one of the lowest rates of coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Only 84.8% of kindergartners had gotten the two recommended doses of the MMR vaccine last school year, well below the 95% threshold necessary to prevent an outbreak. Only Alaska and Idaho had lower MMR vaccination rates, the CDC data shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000b3b6njyd60o8l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Back-to-school brings a lot of kids together and measles is very, very infectious,” Troisi said. “So if you bring kids together and one of them happens to have measles, that’s just a great way to spread the virus.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000c3b6nmfm1qmu9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Declining vaccination rates also leave more kids vulnerable, she said, including those who are not vaccinated, those who are vaccinated but immunocompromised and those who are too young to be vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000d3b6neyo6koz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you have more kids at risk, then the chance of measles spreading increases,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000e3b6nefxbja1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wisconsin is one of just 15 states that allow parents to exempt their schoolchildren from required vaccines for “personal conviction reasons,” in addition to religious beliefs or for medical reasons. There was a record rate of exemptions in the US last school year, CDC data shows, with about 3.6% of incoming kindergartners allowed to miss at least one required vaccine – and the exemption rate in Wisconsin was more than double that, at 7.6%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000f3b6ns6mtrg8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Academy of Pediatrics says that non-medical exemptions to school immunization requirements should be eliminated, a longstanding position that the organization recently &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072714/202656/Medical-vs-Nonmedical-Immunization-Exemptions-for" target="_blank"&gt;reaffirmed&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000g3b6nvmuumj4w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Exempting children for nonmedical reasons from immunizations is problematic for medical, public health, and ethical reasons and creates unnecessary risk to both individuals and communities,” AAP leaders wrote in a policy statement last month. “Although there are certainly families who would value having the option to decline vaccines and also send their children to school, nonmedical exemptions threaten the safety of the entire school community and shift the burden of protecting their children to the parents of children who are medically fragile, immunocompromised, or unable to receive immunizations for medical reasons.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme00nwb300003b6ngf66sv0c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new measles outbreak was announced in Michigan’s Osceola County last week, with the original case resulting from an individual who was exposed to measles while traveling out of state. It’s the third outbreak in the state, which has now reported at least 27 cases this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000h3b6nkdngxx1y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wyoming also &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/four-additional-measles-cases-confirmed-in-carbon-county/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a batch of new measles cases on Saturday: four new cases in Carbon County were exposed to an individual with a confirmed measles infection, bringing the state’s total up to seven.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme0169ii00023b6n9z29s872@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data from the Wyoming health department shows that &lt;a href="https://health.wyo.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2023-Carbon-County-Report-Card.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Carbon County&lt;/a&gt; had some of the lowest vaccination rates among children in the state in 2023, ranking 21st out of 23 counties with just 66% of toddlers having gotten at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000i3b6n4rnzpwjy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “County-level vaccination coverage estimates are important because public health issues often begin in small geographic areas and certain public health actions are most effective at the local level,” according to the Wyoming health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000j3b6nqk3451th@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unvaccinated individuals tend to be geographically clustered within certain communities, experts say, as families with similar sociocultural beliefs often live near each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000k3b6ncpe7ax6t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This phenomenon results in a greater likelihood of disease outbreaks when a vaccine-preventable illness is introduced into these communities,” AAP leaders wrote in the policy statement. “Outbreaks that start in communities with low vaccination coverage have the potential to spread beyond those communities into other communities with low vaccination coverage or into the broader population, particularly for diseases like measles, varicella, and pertussis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000l3b6nffjts8o0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the start of the school year poses new risks, it also creates opportunities for trusted community leaders to encourage and promote vaccination, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdzzg4h2000m3b6n9fqs0wds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We do know that if vaccine clinics are held at schools, that will increase (coverage) just by making it easier for parents to get their kids vaccinated,” Troisi said. “School nurses are respected, so having them talk about how important vaccines are is another strategy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

It isn’t so much that position changes allow for an &lt;em&gt;illusion&lt;/em&gt; of lasting longer, though, as it is that interrupting the kind of repetition of stimulation that feels so good it might cause an orgasm interrupts that orgasm. Position changes allow for &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; lasting longer. Slowing down before the point of orgasm also tends to cause that interruption. Taking a break to provide oral stimulation or focus on other parts of your wife’s body will serve that purpose, too.&lt;/p&gt;

You might watch a few full sex scenes (as opposed to the more common practice of scanning for the couple of minutes that really push your buttons) from couples-oriented or narrative-driven studios with an eye toward what male performers do when they need a break from stimulation of their penis for ideas about how to keep the energy going.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cme064z0v001f3b793j0vgkw9@published"&gt;You do have to keep in mind that performers in adult videos are also prioritizing what looks good over what feels good, and achieving the length of time needed for a scene over having the most erotic experience possible. Yes, generally the secondary goal is to experience (and therefore authentically display) pleasure. But it’s a very different main objective than what most people consider when having sex with their partner at home.&lt;/p&gt;

You can experiment with distracting yourself from what your penis is feeling, whether that’s literally baseball or some aspect of the sex you’re experiencing that won’t send you over the edge. And, with your Fleshlight (Disclosure: I’ve had a licensing deal with them for over a decade), you can practice finding the point of no return and then retreating from it so you’re more proficient when you and your wife can return to having sex with each other. (If you’re really stuck on getting info from a pro, my former colleague Erik Everhard has a whole coaching program called The Everhard Academy.)&lt;/p&gt;

The current outbreak is affecting ZIP codes 10027, 10030, 10035, 10037 and 10039 and the surrounding areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5ggdr"&gt;Here’s what you need to know now about Legionnaires’ disease, who’s most at risk and what the city is doing to prevent more people from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="ee7f3"&gt;What is Legionnaires’ disease and how does it spread?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a85cq"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a form of pneumonia that first &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/online/story-of-cdc/legionnaires/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;emerged in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt; in 1976 in an outbreak affecting attendees of an American Legion convention, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2vgfm"&gt;The disease is not spread from person to person, according to the CDC. Instead it’s typically spread by inhaling mist containing Legionella bacteria, which can grow in water systems such as cooling towers, hot tubs and plumbing systems. Typically, Legionella grows in water that’s warm, stagnant or doesn’t contain enough disinfectant, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7evn7"&gt;Window air conditioners are not a source of Legionnaires’ disease, the CDC adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="b5qip"&gt;In New York City, hundreds of cases of Legionnaires’ disease have been reported each year for the past decade and cooling towers have become a particular source of concern. They are linked to both the current outbreak and major outbreaks that originated in the Bronx in 2015 and at Amsterdam Nursing Home in Upper Manhattan in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7hsaf"&gt;City officials have emphasized that the current outbreak in Harlem is not tied to issues with buildings’ plumbing systems, so people in the area can safely drink tap water, use their air conditioners, shower and cook as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="dobq2"&gt;What are the symptoms of Legionnaires’ and who’s most at risk?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c33qm"&gt;Not everyone who is exposed to Legionella bacteria develops symptoms and most people are at low risk for the disease, according to city health officials. Symptoms are typically similar to those associated with the flu. They can include cough, fever, chills, muscle aches and difficulty breathing, according to the city health department. They can also include headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion or diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8o609"&gt;About 1 in 10 people diagnosed with Legionnaires’ dies from complications of the disease, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5uh2"&gt;People who are over 50, smoke or have chronic lung disease or weakened immune systems are at higher risk for severe disease, according to the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="1goij"&gt;What should you do if you feel sick?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="58ujc"&gt;New Yorkers with flu-like symptoms should seek medical attention so they can be tested and treated for Legionnaires’ disease, especially if they’re in a high-risk group, according to acting city Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse. Treatment, which may include antibiotics, is particularly effective if the disease is caught early, Morse said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="aio2h"&gt;Can Legionnaires’ disease be prevented?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="17dpd"&gt;There’s no vaccine for Legionnaires’, but local lawmakers have taken steps in recent years to try to ensure better maintenance of water cooling towers. After a 2015 outbreak in the Bronx that resulted in 138 cases and 16 deaths, the City Council passed legislation requiring every water cooling tower to be registered with the city and requiring the city to track cooling tower inspections and violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ed5ns"&gt;The number of Legionnaires’ cases reported annually in the city has fluctuated since then. In 2018, more than 600 cases were reported. Last year, there were 257, according to a preliminary count from the health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bmurk"&gt;According to the city health department, when &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/environmental/legionnaires-disease-building-evaluations.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two or more cases&lt;/a&gt; of Legionnaires’ are confirmed within a 12-month period that are associated with a particular residential building with a shared hot water system, the city mandates an evaluation of the building’s water system and orders the building owner to notify residents and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="aaqvl"&gt;What is the city doing to contain the current outbreak?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dqntf"&gt;After the city noticed a cluster of Legionnaires’ cases emerging in Harlem last month, officials screened all water cooling towers in the area for Legionella bacteria, according to the city health department. The 11 buildings that tested positive for the bacteria have been ordered to conduct remediation, including cleaning water towers and adjusting chemical solutions as needed, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="90p1n"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the city health department, said officials expect that initial remediation will prevent more people in the area from getting sick. But, she said, it’s likely more cases will be reported before the outbreak is over because the incubation period for Legionnaires’ can delay symptoms by several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="9hq5j"&gt;&lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt;hat are the outstanding questions about the current outbreak?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3e7sc"&gt;The city has not released information on the people who have died from Legionnaires’ in the current outbreak, including their ages or whether they had underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="be06g"&gt;Officials also have not shared the addresses of the 11 buildings in the affected area whose water towers tested positive for Legionella bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1s319"&gt;According to Gomez at the city health department, public health lab experts are still working to identify which specific building or buildings caused the current cluster of Legionnaires’ cases. She said those facilities will undergo more thorough remediation once they’re identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3ukd8"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story has been updated to reflect a third death Tuesday. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 17:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOSW1rMXE4T3JJYWlHcVdvNkM1MnM5RVk5aTc3UXEyQnFxU2FRQTlxUGN2cW52enByZkhxWHd2T0RMRmpJaFRIOWIzOEV4bnM3THNabkRpbDIyNU5KdEczbmdPMGpKUVE0RWRjUlI0ME50cXZJNzhIVjJHWDdOWUtBOTlxRzZTUFBRVEJRWlYwNUpiMlpndzVCcVBxbzRYekxGWTlYQncyQ1U</guid></item><item><title>如果您在睡眠充足的情况下总是感到疲倦，那么您的大脑可能会发出这7个问题的信号- VegOut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxOV09UVHlxSDBLRVppbjJlbVp6bmQ4ZWxwYmtDVExCZW1nZmgyQ3FESmQxUHJpb1FFQ1g5VmRjczVzM0NLSDVrU20xMTlkODZMUkpWVEdvbHRxcFY0N1ZtSVhPV043MVFaRlpxbEJNRU45MkNvcWxFeFB4Z2tsd2l0LTF5Zll2OXM3TmlKdnFBbHktQmVFN2NPeXVHeDQ0dU9CQVg4ZS1vQVNUQzVHLVlUa1VmcmRRbzhYT0c2TkJJSm80dUxnZmI0QjlsWkZkZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p data-start="229" data-end="350"&gt;You know those mornings where you wake up after eight full hours… and still feel like you’ve been hit by a freight train?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="352" data-end="392"&gt;Been there. More than I’d like to admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="394" data-end="620"&gt;At some point, I had to stop blaming my mattress and start paying attention to what else was going on. Because if you're constantly tired even after sleeping "enough," your brain might be throwing up flares — not just fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="622" data-end="752"&gt;Let’s get into the seven most likely reasons your brain is running low on fuel, even when your sleep schedule looks fine on paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="759" data-end="799"&gt;1. Your brain is stuck in threat mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="171" data-end="248"&gt;Stress isn’t just a feeling — it’s a state your entire nervous system enters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="250" data-end="418"&gt;Even if your body is lying still in bed, your brain might be on high alert. That’s especially true if you're going through a rough patch or living with chronic anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="420" data-end="485"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://graciousquotes.com/andrew-huberman/?.com"&gt;Dr. Andrew Huberman&lt;/a&gt;, neuroscientist at Stanford, has stated: “The body and brain respond to any form of stress in the same way, whether it’s psychological or physical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="690" data-end="903"&gt;This underscores how what your brain perceives as stress — whether emotional, cognitive, or physical — triggers the autonomic nervous system into action, keeping you in a heightened state even when you’re resting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="905" data-end="1060"&gt;Translation? You might be technically asleep, but your brain is still working overtime. It’s like a fire alarm buzzing quietly in the background all night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1062" data-end="1163"&gt;If you’re waking up feeling like you’ve run a marathon, your brain may be sleeping with one eye open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1542" data-end="1585"&gt;2. You’re emotionally bottling things up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1587" data-end="1643"&gt;This one surprised me when I first noticed it in myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1645" data-end="1820"&gt;I was going through a period where I felt fine during the day, but I’d wake up feeling depleted. Turns out, I wasn’t fine. I just wasn’t dealing with stuff — I was storing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1822" data-end="2050"&gt;Emotional suppression takes energy. You spend your waking hours holding it together, and when your head hits the pillow, your subconscious takes the wheel. It’s not uncommon for the brain to process buried emotions during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="161" data-end="200"&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;As sleep researcher Rosalind Cartwright noted: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;“In the healthy person, dreams regulate mood.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;This is based on her studies showing that dreaming helps &lt;a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2012/08/13/the-twenty-four-hour-mind-rosalind-cartwright/?.com"&gt;down‑regulate negative emotions&lt;/a&gt; overnight and supports emotional recovery after life stress, like divorce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2167" data-end="2250"&gt;That could explain those vivid dreams or unexplained exhaustion after “good” sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2252" data-end="2460"&gt;Ask yourself: are you giving yourself enough space to process what you’re feeling? Journaling, talking to a friend, or even just naming what’s bothering you can reduce the weight your brain carries overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2467" data-end="2512"&gt;3. You’re overloaded with decision fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2514" data-end="2598"&gt;Ever been to a diner with 15 pages of menu options and left feeling weirdly drained?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2600" data-end="2637"&gt;Now imagine that’s your &lt;em data-start="2624" data-end="2636"&gt;whole life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2639" data-end="2829"&gt;We’re exposed to more choices in a day than our ancestors faced in a month — what to wear, what to eat, what to watch, what app to use. And every decision, big or small, costs mental energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2831" data-end="2983"&gt;This cognitive drain doesn't necessarily stop when you're asleep. If your days are mentally chaotic, your brain might not be getting the break it needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2985" data-end="3171"&gt;I’ve mentioned this before, but during a solo trip through Vietnam, I packed light and kept my decisions minimal. My energy shot up. Simplicity isn’t just an aesthetic — it’s brain fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3173" data-end="3299"&gt;Consider limiting small decisions with things like meal prepping, outfit planning, or app blocking. Your brain will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3306" data-end="3359"&gt;4. You’re mentally bored — and your brain knows it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3361" data-end="3444"&gt;It sounds counterintuitive, but being under-stimulated can leave you exhausted too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3446" data-end="3646"&gt;If your daily routine feels like autopilot, your brain might be checking out. And when it does, it looks for stimulation elsewhere — often through overthinking, worry loops, or compulsive screen time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="122" data-end="161"&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;As Dr. Judson Brewer, addiction psychiatrist and neuroscientist behind &lt;a href="https://www.bookey.app/book/the-craving-mind/quote?.com"&gt;The Craving Mind&lt;/a&gt;, puts it: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;“The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="122" data-end="161"&gt;&lt;span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out"&gt;This succinctly captures how when our environment feels dull, the brain kicks into craving mode to seek something rewarding, even if that means anxious thought loops or distraction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3884" data-end="4069"&gt;I once spent two weeks doing repetitive freelance editing work that paid well but bored me to death. I got nine hours of sleep each night, but woke up tired every day. No mystery there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4071" data-end="4253"&gt;Inject something mentally nourishing into your routine — a podcast, a challenging hobby, or conversations that actually stretch you. Your energy might rebound faster than you expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4260" data-end="4302"&gt;5. Your dopamine system is out of whack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4304" data-end="4396"&gt;Let’s talk about dopamine — the brain chemical responsible for motivation, reward, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4398" data-end="4540"&gt;Thanks to the internet, we’re swimming in dopamine spikes: notifications, fast-paced videos, endless scrolls. But those spikes come at a cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4542" data-end="4801"&gt;If your dopamine system gets overstimulated, your brain reduces its sensitivity to it. That can leave you feeling flatlined — not just emotionally, but physically. Motivation dips. Energy tanks. Even after sleep, you feel like you’re walking through molasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4803" data-end="4834"&gt;The solution? Dopamine balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4836" data-end="5025"&gt;Cut down on artificial highs and give your brain time to reset. Long walks without your phone, reading instead of bingeing, or spacing out your tech use can all help regulate your baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5027" data-end="5173"&gt;I've tried dopamine fasts before, and while they sound intense, even a day without stimulation can make your baseline energy feel more… available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5180" data-end="5234"&gt;6. You’re chronically disconnected from your values&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5236" data-end="5255"&gt;This one hits deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5257" data-end="5423"&gt;You can be doing everything “right” — eating healthy, sleeping well, exercising — but still feel tired if your days are out of sync with what actually matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5425" data-end="5557"&gt;Psychological dissonance (aka living out of alignment with your values) can be subtle. You might not notice it, but your brain does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5559" data-end="5781"&gt;Let’s say creativity is important to you, but your job doesn’t allow for it. Or connection is a priority, but your days are filled with solo tasks. Over time, that creates a low-grade exhaustion that sleep alone can’t fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5783" data-end="5971"&gt;I’ve felt this most when I’ve said yes to too many things that didn’t feel like me. It’s sneaky. But once I realigned — even slightly — with what I actually cared about, my energy shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5973" data-end="6059"&gt;Check in: Are you spending time on things that reflect who you are and what you value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6066" data-end="6102"&gt;7. You’re ignoring mental clutter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6104" data-end="6153"&gt;Last one — and it’s probably the most overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6155" data-end="6393"&gt;Mental clutter is like having 37 open tabs in your brain. Not necessarily urgent stuff, just... lingering. That email you keep meaning to send. That unresolved conflict. That subscription you need to cancel. That goal you keep postponing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6395" data-end="6460"&gt;These unclosed loops burn mental bandwidth, even while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6462" data-end="6504"&gt;As productivity expert David Allen put it: “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6559" data-end="6721"&gt;One trick that’s worked for me: a weekly “mental dump.” I jot down every to-do, nagging thought, or loose end. Then I either schedule it, delete it, or let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6723" data-end="6793"&gt;The clearer your mind, the better your brain can rest. Simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6800" data-end="6818"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;

A similar situation occurred in Florida after Hurricane Ian in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, an &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2023/han00497.html"&gt;average of 150 to 200 cases are reported in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., with most occurring in Gulf Coast states, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;How do you know If you have the bacteria?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people infected with &lt;i&gt;Vibrio&lt;/i&gt; experience diarrhea, and some may also have stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. One species, &lt;i&gt;V. vulnificus&lt;/i&gt;, is known to cause life-threatening infections, and about one in five infected people die — sometimes within one to two days after becoming ill, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025"&gt;Louisiana has reported the most &lt;i&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; cases&lt;/a&gt; so far in 2025, with 17 infections — well above the state’s annual average of seven, based on data from the Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria live in coastal waters, including saltwater and brackish water (a mix of salt and fresh water). Most people become infected by eating raw or undercooked seafood, particularly oysters. Infection can also occur when an open wound is exposed to water containing the bacteria, according to the CDC’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Preventive measures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Florida Department of Health recommends taking steps to avoid infection, such as cooking seafood to safe internal temperatures before eating, keeping raw or undercooked seafood and their juices away from other foods.

One common factor is structural shifts in the eye. For instance, a cataract – a condition that clouds the eye’s lens – can gradually tint vision with a yellow-brown “brunescent” hue. In the US, about &lt;a href="https://eye.ufl.edu/2024/10/02/are-you-one-of-the-millions-about-to-have-cataract-surgery-heres-what-ophthalmologists-say-you-need-to-know/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;4m&lt;/a&gt; cataract surgeries are performed annually. A brunescent lens “can pull the blue and green out” of the world around us, says Dr Andrew Iwach of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. After a cataract is removed, the difference in color clarity afterward can be so striking that Iwach wears a bright blue tie to delight his recovering patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="61573f8e-ceb4-4641-a94b-bd4ec20c596a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Why it’s important to protect your hearing as you age – and what experts suggest","elementId":"61573f8e-ceb4-4641-a94b-bd4ec20c596a","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jul/30/hearing-loss-clarity-cognitive-decline-isolation"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Changes in color perception can also be caused by glaucoma or macular degeneration. Iwach recommends &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/salud-ocular/consejos/eye-exams-101" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;routine eye exams&lt;/a&gt;, and says if you notice this type of change, see an ophthalmologist. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/sep/05/treating-eyesight-issues-could-prevent-one-in-five-dementia-cases-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research from 2024&lt;/a&gt; found that up to 15% of global dementia cases could be linked to problems with color perception issues, meaning that an eye exam can be an important step in screening and mitigating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some medications can also affect color perception, says Iwach – namely Viagra (pilots are &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/ame_guide/pharm/ed" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;required&lt;/a&gt; to abstain from the drug eight hours before flying lest it affect their perception of blue hues) and some types of heart and tuberculosis medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet research suggests that even in the absence of eye disease or medication use, color perception can shift over the course of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Janneke van Leeuwen, a social neuroscientist and honorary research fellow at University College London’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, noticed a subtle trend in behavioral studies from the last three decades: older adults &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/col.5080180606" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consistently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/1350946296000018?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rated&lt;/a&gt; colors duller than younger participants did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Van Leeuwen set out to investigate: do we truly see the world differently as we age?

They found a reduction in the way older people’s pupils responded to more highly saturated colors, even when correcting for the shrunken baseline pupil sizes that come with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Thus, it seems some older adults may genuinely perceive the world as less colorful. Van Leeuwen recalls one participant saying: “Oh, it’s a shame there’s not a real punchy red.” “I was thinking: ‘Well, you’re looking at one!’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The issue, Van Leeuwen explains, “doesn’t necessarily originate in the eyes, but in the brain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pupil responses are controlled by the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, a midbrain structure that receives input from the retina and the visual cortex. This means that pupillary reactions reflect both what the eyes detect and how the brain processes that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

More research is needed to understand why, but the cause probably lies in how the cones in our eyes interact with color-processing pathways in the brain. Currently, Van Leeuwen is following up her study with an investigation into how differences in saturation perception influence the way colors make younger and older adults feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="bebe5a74-77d1-46e1-a0a0-f7747d4a54a4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":18,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I’m an expert on ageing.

Believed to be an evolutionary trait for important evaluations such as the ripeness of fruit, this effect also takes place in the primary visual cortex. This “further supports our findings that the decline in sensitivity in color saturation in healthy ageing originates in the brain, and not the eyes”, says Van Leeuwen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is no sign this loss of saturation perception follows the same process as the onset of certain types of dementia, Van Leeuwen emphasizes – many older adults experience vision declines without developing dementia, which has multiple risk factors. However, the study does provide insight into how our brains change as a result of normal, healthy ageing, which is useful context in the study of neurological disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Is there anything you can do to stop age-related declines in saturation perception? Researchers don’t currently believe that lifestyle habits can meaningfully influence this process. But there’s some evidence that the brain can be “trained” to see the world differently. Anya Hurlbert, a color and vision scientist at Newcastle University, points to a &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(20)30741-7.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; involving EnChroma glasses, which feature a saturation-boosting tint to help reduce the effects of some types of color blindness. Participants with red-green color perception deficiencies who wore the glasses reported seeing increased color saturation even after removing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alternatively, simply surrounding oneself with more intense colors could help. As Van Leeuwen notes, “Older adults tend to evaluate more saturated colors more positively than younger adults … which seems to suggest they might need the extra stimulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Just another reason to see the new Wes Anderson movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE52MVFUOWJWcF94dGJ5VG00cjhXZ2VMcFBKdHA0TnN3bVhjVTg0a3lYa1ljMkJHZk5LVXRLS2IxTUh6MUVVVmdWeV9TN1NjN2I2MXgtTUZjTzY1aVBFUFZOcWpOLTZpQ3IwanVScURpMmlZeGlpcldkX29zMTk</guid></item><item><title>科学家刚刚对3万只蚊子进行了测试，以验证一种新型驱蚊剂的有效性，而且非常有效。- evidencenetwork.ca</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggJBVV95cUxPSUMwSnBjZkNTX256UFVoT19HaUlRZUZNdXZoRF8xVW51V3JqS3VBNE5pQmxwanpidm43WDgzVmFrbjBKNHVyVEJjUkdXd194VHR6eTJNMEdnRFNqZ2IzSmhlX0ZScUdHa3pPV29uaXotRlc3RXJhNzBkZUNHaTFCRjVLUlM5MXRqY2JsSUc0MVU2ejd3Rjl2c01FZkRZS0ZVeWVsWEdkQ1dtZ3hGZDJzM0V0NHA2X1pXTGZDR3lSSVAwMzlLYnBhT2NLbF9BTWRtRmZyOU56OERnU3I5VGJzWnc4UUh5RlpETXByTlExdVZZTWpYTll4bXpmSUJmUndZU0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle against mosquitoes has intensified in recent years, particularly against the tiger mosquito species that poses significant health risks. A groundbreaking natural repellent has shown remarkable effectiveness in an extreme test involving thousands of these persistent pests. This innovative solution offers new hope for those seeking chemical-free protection during mosquito season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Revolutionary natural mosquito repellent undergoes extreme testing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an extraordinary demonstration of confidence, a researcher in Guadeloupe recently subjected herself to a challenging test that few would dare attempt. Marie Modeste, a molecular biotechnology researcher, entered a sealed cage containing 32,000 hungry tiger mosquitoes after applying a natural repellent called Kreopik to her entire body. This test represents one of the most extreme evaluations of a mosquito repellent ever conducted.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The experiment began with a control test where Modeste inserted her arm into a small hermetic cage without any protection. As expected, this resulted in multiple bites. The main test followed, with the researcher entering a 3×3 meter sealed enclosure containing thousands of hungry insects that had been deprived of food for over eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After spending more than twenty minutes surrounded by the aggressive insects, Modeste emerged completely bite-free. While the experience was described as uncomfortable, the &lt;strong&gt;natural repellent’s effectiveness against tiger mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt; was conclusively demonstrated under extreme conditions that far exceed what anyone would encounter in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This remarkable test shows promising results in our ongoing battle against disease vectors. Much like how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/exercise-fights-cancer-now-we-understand-how/"&gt;exercise helps combat serious diseases like cancer&lt;/a&gt;, natural solutions can offer protection against insect-borne illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Locally sourced ingredients power effective protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes Kreopik particularly noteworthy is its 100% natural composition based on locally sourced ingredients from Guadeloupe. The research team developed this repellent using a blend of:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential oils with natural repellent properties&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Shea butter for smooth application and skin nourishment&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cocoa butter providing lasting protection and moisturization&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Other natural botanical ingredients native to the region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://la1ere.franceinfo.fr/guadeloupe/lutte-contre-les-moustiques-un-test-a-grande-echelle-avec-30-000-moustiques-tigres-1595688.html"&gt;According to this study&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;strong&gt;natural tiger mosquito deterrent&lt;/strong&gt; represents a significant advancement in mosquito protection because it eliminates concerns about chemical exposure. Many conventional repellents contain DEET and other synthetic compounds that can cause skin irritation or raise health concerns, especially with frequent application.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research into natural repellents has gained momentum as public health concerns about mosquito-borne diseases increase. The spread of tiger mosquitoes resembles how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/a-gene-has-given-the-black-plague-a-unique-adaptation-capacity/"&gt;certain diseases adapt and spread through genetic advantages&lt;/a&gt;, making effective countermeasures increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind Kreopik are now expanding their work to develop a 100% natural herbicide, demonstrating a broader commitment to creating environmentally friendly solutions for common problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Comparing natural versus chemical repellents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why tiger mosquitoes pose a serious health threat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) represents a significant public health concern in many regions worldwide. Originally native to Southeast Asia, this invasive species has spread to every continent except Antarctica. In Guadeloupe and increasingly in mainland France, these mosquitoes pose a growing threat to public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes tiger mosquitoes particularly dangerous is their potential to transmit several serious diseases. &lt;em&gt;Their role as disease vectors makes them significantly more dangerous than mere nuisance insects&lt;/em&gt;. These mosquitoes can carry viruses that cause:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dengue fever – causing severe joint pain and potentially fatal complications&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chikungunya – resulting in debilitating joint pain that can last for months&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zika virus – particularly dangerous for pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Yellow fever – a serious hemorrhagic disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tiger mosquitoes are also more challenging to detect than common mosquitoes. They are smaller, produce less buzzing noise, and their feeding behavior makes their presence less noticeable until after they’ve bitten. This stealthy nature increases exposure risk, similar to how &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/babies-treated-with-antibiotics-respond-less-well-to-vaccines/"&gt;certain medical treatments can affect immune responses without immediate notice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, tiger mosquitoes are diurnal feeders, active during daylight hours when people are typically outdoors, unlike many mosquito species that feed primarily at dawn and dusk. This behavior pattern increases human exposure and the subsequent risk of disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Advancing natural protection strategies against mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The successful testing of Kreopik opens new possibilities for &lt;strong&gt;natural mosquito protection solutions&lt;/strong&gt; that don’t rely on synthetic chemicals. As climate change expands the range of mosquito-borne diseases, the need for effective, safe repellents grows increasingly urgent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors significantly influence mosquito populations and behavior. Research shows that the &lt;a href="https://evidencenetwork.ca/the-brain-can-change-intestinal-bacteria-in-a-couple-of-hours/"&gt;relationship between environmental conditions and biological responses&lt;/a&gt; affects many aspects of public health, including insect-borne disease transmission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The development of natural repellents like Kreopik represents a holistic approach to mosquito control that addresses both human safety and environmental concerns. By utilizing sustainably sourced botanical ingredients, these solutions minimize ecological impact while providing effective protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional adaptation of natural repellent formulations offers particular advantages&lt;/em&gt;, as locally available plants often evolve natural defenses against native insect species. This localized approach potentially creates more effective protection specific to regional mosquito populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As this research continues to advance, we may see more diverse natural options becoming available, giving consumers alternatives to chemical repellents while maintaining strong protection against these disease-carrying insects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>evidencenetwork.ca</author><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 15:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggJBVV95cUxPSUMwSnBjZkNTX256UFVoT19HaUlRZUZNdXZoRF8xVW51V3JqS3VBNE5pQmxwanpidm43WDgzVmFrbjBKNHVyVEJjUkdXd194VHR6eTJNMEdnRFNqZ2IzSmhlX0ZScUdHa3pPV29uaXotRlc3RXJhNzBkZUNHaTFCRjVLUlM5MXRqY2JsSUc0MVU2ejd3Rjl2c01FZkRZS0ZVeWVsWEdkQ1dtZ3hGZDJzM0V0NHA2X1pXTGZDR3lSSVAwMzlLYnBhT2NLbF9BTWRtRmZyOU56OERnU3I5VGJzWnc4UUh5RlpETXByTlExdVZZTWpYTll4bXpmSUJmUndZU0E</guid></item></channel></rss>
