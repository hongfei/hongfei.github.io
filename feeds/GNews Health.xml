Photograph: Lombardini22 Neuroscience Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Participants were then split into groups and shown the same three faces multiple times, either with a neutral expression or signs of viral infections such as skin rashes. In some experiments, an additional subset of participants were shown the faces displaying an expression of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In one experiment, participants were asked to press a button as fast as possible after receiving a mild touch to their face while an avatar was shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team found that when the avatars showed signs of sickness, participants pressed the button when the faces appeared further away than for faces showing a neutral or fearful expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Results from EEG tests to investigate the electrical activity of the brain tallied with these findings. As expected, as avatars loomed closer, the brain system that represents the space closely surrounding our body became activated. However, this activation differed when the avatars showed signs of infection compared with neutral expressions, even when they appeared far away. These differences, the team add, were localised in areas of the brain involved in detecting and filtering threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team found that functional MRI (fMRI) brain scans supported these results, further revealing that when infectious avatars were shown there was a greater connection between this threat-detection network and part of the brain called the hypothalamus, which acts as a key regulation centre for the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team also found differences in participants’ blood when they were shown the infectious avatars compared with neutral or fearful faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“[In terms of cells], we saw mainly that there is an activation of an immune cell family called the innate lymphoid cells (ILCs)that [are] early responders in immunity to basically alarm other immune cells,” said Prof Camilla Jandus of the University of Geneva and an author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team added that they found a similar activation of ILCs when they examined the blood of individuals who had received an influenza vaccine but had not been exposed to the VR setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Esther Diekhof of the University of Hamburg, who was not involved in the work, said the study chimed with previous research, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088915912500025X#:~:text=Perceiving%20sneezing%20and%20sick%20individuals,to%20increased%20release%20of%20sIgA." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;including that of her own team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The study provides yet another good example for the existence of a mechanism that responds to potential contagion threats even before the immune system has come into contact with pathogens,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But Prof Benedict Seddon, of University College London, said questions remained, including whether the observed responses help the immune system actually fight an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When we get infected, by Sars-CoV for instance, it can take a day or two for the infection to establish and for the immune system to become aware of it and respond, a long time after the initial encounter that stimulated this short-lived mobilisation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNMUJPN2E2VUdBUkwxTzVzbFFSVjBuUHY5U2w1T2J5eDhyZ1ZHZ09oSFN3Vng5REtGNHpiQThlNUlaaGdGV0tCalYzSVZxNjhwdWpkeXpzSmUwZjUzS3lCcmZuU1d5R2k2b1pFZEVHeXRrX21PYmdNcGJnUVVkUFotX1lyNUp0WkNsVTliYkpsWGJrdFNmWHNPXy1kN3VOWFcyeVpFdUFwMEZIN0NNZTU5ODB6dHh3QkQza2dSQ0hieS1XcVVKVGhr</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，您实际上可以在丧亲后死于心碎- CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPckdTa0JTdXBXMlhEd3R0bFYxNEZWOWNldXFxNng4cnFndzk5bXA1a25sNkNSQ19WQU9uSFpuc2ROM2drMm0zQUJjMzdaRHpvVmRzZ0QwRFRsYU5ZcFpXWlpKYUdDeDN6R0psZWNkX29WVzNkdHFEaVF0TTZhLXA1OTRaWGhWdU1VeWh4UGFQWXRfNjdsQnfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTXptcXcxS3lPQ2tWNFhSS1dHaVFRUUtWQUV6YnV4cGxzSDh1NFdPNlBWRXIyOU16dmZaNlkzbllzSDZuTzRtRjdZYnpLeHlSdGdwNWZJREIycnpfRG50bmNyRENLbkNvZWtSak5KaEdRXzJ2VDk5aFZmSzZkTXY0QzlGOUlydkFkTkQ0ZzF5Ylc1ZkdDdUJkM0x6VGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh0006356n45g64xml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/health/broken-heart-syndrome/index.html"&gt;Bereaved relatives&lt;/a&gt; who experienced “high levels” of grief symptoms were more likely to die in the 10 years following their &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/health/broken-heart-syndrome-wellness"&gt;bereavement&lt;/a&gt; than those who experienced “low levels” of grief, a study published Friday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2025.1619730/full" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Public Health&lt;/a&gt; found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh0009356n5wt7fke5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the study, coauthor Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen, a postdoctoral researcher&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at Aarhus University in Denmark, and her colleagues investigated the long-term health outcomes of bereaved relatives in Denmark over the course of 10 years, dividing the 1,735 participants into groups who experienced “low levels” and “high levels” of grief symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn61qfu0009356nherbzzb1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the study period, 26.5% of the relatives who showed high levels of grief died, compared with 7.3% of those who were less powerfully affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn4f52j0002356nnrq2es7k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These “high levels” of grief are defined as someone experiencing more than half of nine grief symptoms researchers have identified. These include feeling emotionally numb or that life is meaningless; experiencing difficulty accepting the loss; and experiencing confusion over their own identity. &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000c356n52iwerxd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants were asked to fill in questionnaires when they first enrolled in the study, as well as six months and three years after their bereavement, allowing researchers to collect their symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000d356npwz18uns@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the same time, researchers observed how often the study participants interacted with the health care system, finding that relatives with high grief symptoms also used more antidepressant medication, mental health services and primary care services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh0007356nw9f9415i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those with a high grief trajectory seem to be a vulnerable group of relatives already before the death, with need for special attention,” Nielsen told CNN via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh0008356nz86aiybo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(They) may need additional support. They may experience distress and have difficulties coping with the situation,” she said, pointing to previous studies that have highlighted low socioeconomic status, poor self-reported health, and higher symptoms of depression and anxiety as all contributing to overwhelming grief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0zqu60000356nprtqbm97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even accounting for these risk factors, the researchers have “done a good job” isolating the specific effect of grief, Sian Harding, a cardiologist and professor emeritus of cardiac pharmacology at Imperial College London who wasn’t involved in the research, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000a356nkpqd8vej@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the “key things” about the paper is its longitudinal perspective, she said, since “we know very well that there’s an acute effect of any kind of bereavement on heart health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000b356nop8s64i8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It was not a particular surprise to me that this particular form of stress, while prolonged, has a damaging effect on the body. It can come out particularly as heart disease, but other things as well,” Harding added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000e356nk7q11a4c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While this study didn’t investigate the bereaved relatives’ causes of death, it aligns with wider research showing the effect a traumatic loss can have on a person’s physical health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn4qu880004356n28a7uoml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One cardiac condition known as broken heart syndrome — also called stress-induced cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy — is a well-established acute phenomenon, triggered by intensely stressful situations, like losing a loved one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000g356ncnf9vx0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prolonged stress caused by bereavement can also cause raised blood pressure, raised cortisol, an increased risk of diabetes, and poor mental health, Harding said. She also noted previous research into broken heart syndrome that found that some people die on the anniversary of their bereavement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdn0o4uh000h356nsnekp27i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Findings from the latest study suggest that healthcare workers “may be able to discover distressed relatives early in the patient’s illness trajectory and offer follow up,” Nielsen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

'Since it didn't seem life-threatening, they sent me home.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mars' condition worsened, and she began throwing up every few hours. Concerned, she went to a different hospital and was told the same thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[They told me] "Your bloodwork shows you're fighting something, but it's not life-threatening,"' she recalled. 'Again, I was sent home.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;JaMarriae Lawrence, who goes by Mars, was working overnight at a Walmart distribution center in Virginia last year when she was hit with a 'sudden, excruciating' pain in her stomach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, that night, the content creator and singer began 'vomiting and having diarrhea at the same time.' Noticing how sick she was, her mom took her to another hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They ran more tests and finally discovered I was septic,' she shared. 'I was hospitalized. They gave me fluids and ran stool and urine cultures.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After running more in-depth tests, doctors found that she had C. difficile (C. diff) in her stool and Mycoplasma hominis in her urine, with Mars saying she contracted the virus from using a bathroom from someone who also suffered from the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) is a type of bacteria that can cause inflammation of the colon, known as colitis, which can cause diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions. Mycoplasma hominis causes pain or burning during urination, genital discharge, and pelvic pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mars was treated with antibiotics and discharged after a week - but that wasn't the end of her medical nightmare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I felt okay for a few months,' she recalled. 'Around the same time, I visited someone who had C. diff at the same time I did the previous year.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used her bathroom and was shocked to find there was no soap. A month later, my symptoms returned,' Mars shared. 'I told my GI doctor that I suspected I had C. diff again. He ordered a stool test, which confirmed it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mars was put on an antibiotic called Dificid, which eventually cleared up her symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mars was treated with antibiotics and discharged after a week - but that wasn't the end of her medical nightmare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After running more tests, doctors discovered Mars was septic. 'I was hospitalized. They gave me fluids and ran stool and urine cultures' she shared&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mars, who lives in Newport News, recalled the pain being so severe she couldn't even stand upright (stomach pictured during her ordeal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This whole ordeal began in April 2024, and I am only now beginning to feel relief,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'C. diff can be picked up anywhere. What I really want people to understand is this: we've become too comfortable with filth,' she pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see people skip handwashing all the time. People go out in public while sick. They don't finish their antibiotics. And all of this leads to antibiotic-resistant superbugs,' Mars continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In elementary school, our teachers made us wash our hands before lunch. But where is that standard now — in middle school, high school, college? I think we've forgotten basic hygiene. I think we've forgotten empathy,' she declared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some say there's always risk of going to public places, which there is, but C. diff isn't a normal bacteria. It's strong. Contagious. And deadly,' Mars warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, 500,000 infections cause 15,000 deaths each year, as per the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15548-c-diff-infection"&gt; Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr. Steven Goldberg, Chief Medical Officer at HealthTrackRx, C. diff can be spread through toilets and bathrooms - especially in hospitals, nursing homes, or shared facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'C. diff is spread via spores that are shed in the stool of an infected person,' he told DailyMail.com. 'These spores can survive on surfaces like toilets, sinks, and medical equipment for weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Transmission typically occurs when someone touches a contaminated surface and then their mouth, or through healthcare workers' hands.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Goldberg added that spores can spread to others if high-touch surfaces like toilets, handles, and sinks are contaminated and not thoroughly disinfected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The proper handwashing with soap and water is critical, as alcohol-based sanitizers do not reliably kill C. diff spores,' he urged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[C. diff] most commonly leads to watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever, and in severe cases, life-threatening complications,' Dr. Goldberg said. 'C. diff often occurs after antibiotic use, which disrupts normal gut bacteria and allows C. diff to overgrow.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 14:09:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNd0txd2FCcDhFX1RvMzRMM09LNWczT1JSYThoLUY0UFMwNm5SVWxaa1F4SEJTSW9nV2kxODBQY1JmeXJvazNPR01jTXlFaDVESUpIRGtPZDVEb0thTnduelV2dlBZZ0FKS2gxUEVCZVN0RjJSZ0Z4RFdUdUlFNV9MMVc4UEpaa0tTNzhFVzlucGl5T1dva0J5NTJpZWHSAaIBQVVfeXFMTTUxVG9GUzdjNzZMQi1MODMzTTlsdU5tYnRWS3FPRy1IOGtFM3REMTFZN1JZRUNVQ01LdGFCdjNVLUhYejBHa0dYS080bmJGMzBJYjBjekZVNDBPTnp0NXFCRmpzN3l4SXQ4bURHOHdPenNOcFlUb21lckdDSlVTZDBxYnBtTDJIdmszXzdMNndyWUZWX2xqMERYeWtyaDJHZGNn</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州脑食变形虫感染导致男孩死亡-《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNaXkzNGsybzh1MEFxWjdZMzBWdkhRUktwVVpzendZZnhxUlRGQkplSloyS0syMVJnZlpQUkFhQk45ajF2WHVIQnRIbnNPYldOUFdfaWM1QjN5d2FVSGRDVGRmUHk5NEhPal9xNm5vZnB1YU4zUWRxQzNSZHp4YmN1WGtQWkk3aG11dENOSVppU3lPOTBLWnFHbDMxNnRIVThaUjNoeGcydWY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNaXkzNGsybzh1MEFxWjdZMzBWdkhRUktwVVpzendZZnhxUlRGQkplSloyS0syMVJnZlpQUkFhQk45ajF2WHVIQnRIbnNPYldOUFdfaWM1QjN5d2FVSGRDVGRmUHk5NEhPal9xNm5vZnB1YU4zUWRxQzNSZHp4YmN1WGtQWkk3aG11dENOSVppU3lPOTBLWnFHbDMxNnRIVThaUjNoeGcydWY?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Infection from brain-eating amoeba kills boy in South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lBaGFEZkRoRWFZV3RGZTRwaDhTZ0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 13:55:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNaXkzNGsybzh1MEFxWjdZMzBWdkhRUktwVVpzendZZnhxUlRGQkplSloyS0syMVJnZlpQUkFhQk45ajF2WHVIQnRIbnNPYldOUFdfaWM1QjN5d2FVSGRDVGRmUHk5NEhPal9xNm5vZnB1YU4zUWRxQzNSZHp4YmN1WGtQWkk3aG11dENOSVppU3lPOTBLWnFHbDMxNnRIVThaUjNoeGcydWY</guid></item><item><title>我刚刚经历了一场恶心而昂贵的考验。现在它又发生了，我会失去它。-石板杂志</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOdTdLZVdnRUZIOW5BbDM4TWVyV25FbERhVWNqbDljaWI0ZmR3N2x5N2E2RU9nQ1J1UmNOQWdTOGhEQ29zellPX3RmZHdrOWtWY2M5LXhNQkRHRE9ySXQwcmtjLTJTNi02TTE3eGxvbi1ySkQyOUNfRF9hbURjNmRwenRqSE02cEE1?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn2zvb5006acqm6ib5og10n@published"&gt;A year and a half ago, I went through one of the most disgusting and stressful experiences of my life. It took all my emergency savings, and most of my mental reserves, to get through it. And now it’s happening again.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3mkdd000r3b77o93slvuw@published"&gt;Last year, for the first time in my life, my apartment had bedbugs. While my landlord covered the cost of the treatment, I had to burn through the majority of my “in case of emergency” savings to get the apartment prepped for fumigation and to replace the items that had to be disposed of. It was horrible, but I  was working under the assumption that I wouldn’t have to deal with this situation again anytime soon, and I got through it.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3sdui00123b77pnmussio@published"&gt;Well, here we are today, and it’s happening again. No bugs have been found in inspection, but some mystery bites and some mystery stains have meant that the whole process needs to be repeated. I feel like I’m on the brink of a mental collapse. I’m exhausted, stressed, and embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="167" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3t2cb00153b77qsnle7bq@published"&gt;But also, I don’t have the money to cover it again! My savings still haven’t recovered from the last time, and the costs are adding up so fast. My parents have offered me a no-interest loan, and my sibling has come through with making sure I still have clothes to wear and a sympathetic ear to talk to. I feel so privileged and grateful to have a family that loves me and supports me, but I feel so bad about even needing it in the first place. I live several hours away from anyone in my immediate family, and my parents have also offered to fly in from out of town so that I’ll have a hotel to stay in for a few nights and so they can help me unpack once the treatment is done. When they offered this to me, I started crying in relief but also with guilt, since it’s now going to cost them even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; money than what they’ve already given me.&lt;/p&gt;

But I can’t shake the shame I feel not being financially stable enough to handle it myself. The fact that there are signs of an infestation but no actual bugs seen yet are also making me feel like I overreacted (even when my landlord has made it clear this isn’t a situation to under-react to). It all feels so wasteful and irresponsible in a way that I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t make any logical sense but that I can’t get out of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

They can wreak havoc on your mental wellness, physical health and, as you’ve seen, your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3ltdx000l3b77wr6y3ztw@published"&gt;Let’s start by separating out your financial issues from your emotional ones. On the financial side, you’re broke, in debt to your parents, and worried about running up the bill beyond what they can afford. Those are all real concerns and they are legitimately anxiety-producing. On the emotional side, you feel indebted to your parents, embarrassed that you can’t pay your own way, and angry you’ve been forced into a place where you’ve used up all your savings paying for someone else’s problem. Cue an additional level of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3ltj9000m3b7760jykvnv@published"&gt;If you can’t live in your apartment because of a pest infestation, you shouldn’t be paying rent. Ask the landlord for a rent abatement while the property is being treated and for the time you couldn’t live in the apartment the last time it happened. If they refuse, look up your local landlord-tenant code and see what it says about the landlord’s responsibility to manage and eradicate pest infestations and what they owe you, the tenant.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn3ltla000n3b77kxuiqbuc@published"&gt;You didn’t say where you live, but New York City has some of the strongest tenant protections and most stringent requirements when it comes to pest infestations, particularly bed bugs. The &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/HousingMaintenanceCode.pdf"&gt;New York City Housing Maintenance Code&lt;/a&gt; (Section 27-2017.2) requires landlords to keep premises free of rodents and insects and tenants have the right to a bedbug-free environment. Bedbugs are specifically named in the list of insects that building owners are legally required to eradicate. Chicago and California (on the state level) also have strong tenant protections.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s no short-term fix, other than &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/04/money-advice-lottery-ticket-roommate.html"&gt;winning the lottery&lt;/a&gt;, which as I’ve written about isn’t exactly a winning strategy. Instead, thank your parents for their love and support. Then, start to map out a longer-term life plan that will give you the financial wherewithal to live your life on your terms, including finding a new job, adding in some side-hustles and for sure finding a new, bug-free place to live.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmdn2zvb5006dcqm66f2xx6hf@published"&gt;I’m not a neat freak. I’ve heard people sometimes do things like clean their baseboards, but I’ve never done it myself, and it doesn’t bother me. That’s my baseline for what comes next. What bothers me is clutter and trash. I feel like I have a pretty normal threshold for not wanting “stuff” on the floor, tables, counters, etc. My wife is less bothered by messiness. She’s not a hoarder. But lived for years with a hoarder roommate, with that level of actual trash in the hallway between our bedrooms, and it didn’t really bother my wife. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/04/house-cleaning-wife-personal-finance-advice.html"&gt;I’m trying to find a middle ground on picking up after ourselves.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When it’s acute, it tends to start suddenly, with an obvious cause (like a broken bone) and a standard fix. But chronic pain, experienced by 1 in 5 adults in the United States, persists for more than three months (or beyond an injury’s expected healing time). And it sometimes doesn’t have a clear cause. So if you have chronic pain, how can you find relief and improve your quality of life? “We’ve learned a lot in recent years about the major differences between acute and chronic pain, which require vastly different approaches,” says Kimeron Hardin, a clinical psychologist and president of the American Association of Pain Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T2HA77FFDZG33OOI756EFKY7TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chronic pain goes beyond the sensory experience of “how much does it hurt and where does it hurt?” says Steven P. Cohen, an anesthesiology professor and vice chair of research and pain medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Our thoughts, emotions and behavior can significantly affect the physical sensation of chronic pain, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GZWA7WCR7BFKDNRVYSXOSVNZYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Medication, physical therapy, steroid injections and implanted devices may be helpful, but newer research has discovered that techniques that target the psychological aspects of pain can also provide relief. In this article, we look at three such treatments. Ask your primary care provider if any of these might be an option. They can refer you to a licensed mental health professional who specializes in chronic pain. You can also find specialists at &lt;a href="http://aapainpsychology.org/" target="_blank"&gt;aapainpsychology.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="EBXF2LD3GFDFJEGFHECI3RR7EI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="EBXF2LD3GFDFJEGFHECI3RR7EI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AAIGDAFO5ZBK3LMVRARSNABZFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This is a form of talk therapy that helps people identify negative thoughts and behaviors and develop skills to change them. For people with chronic pain, expecting the worst or focusing on the pain can actually increase the discomfort they feel. “Many people have fear-based or catastrophic thinking around pain that can make pain worse,” Hardin says. “CBT can help you understand patterns that might be exacerbating your pain and teach you how to recognize and replace those thoughts with something that’s soothing, comforting and even more accurate.” A &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007407.pub4/full" target="_blank"&gt;2020 Cochrane Review&lt;/a&gt; found that CBT led to a small but significant reduction in disability and distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="J64GJMVRBRGCRPZOE3CQWX2CIU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="J64GJMVRBRGCRPZOE3CQWX2CIU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Acceptance and commitment therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RNP5PMQVUZDUZKPCR45VAKDW4A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This has some things in common with CBT but adds in mindfulness techniques. And while CBT focuses on changing the way people think about their pain, ACT helps people accept their pain and commit to lifestyle changes that will lessen its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GMJ53ZGQWRHALABKTY4REUBFYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Such changes are standard advice for conditions like high blood pressure, and they can be helpful for treating chronic pain, too. Physical inactivity, stress and poor sleep are all linked to more severe chronic pain. ACT also helps people distill what matters most to their quality of life, such as family time, and then figure out which actions can facilitate that despite the pain. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35228207/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review of 25 trials&lt;/a&gt; found that ACT helped reduce disability and depression and improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZZXFKSFJXVFSHL5EI2X7BKMS2E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZZXFKSFJXVFSHL5EI2X7BKMS2E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Pain reprocessing therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCZF2MXEX5CH7LDTRA2TML5KEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;People with chronic pain that has no identifiable cause — such as fibromyalgia and some back pain — may become overly sensitive to stimuli such as pressure or heat, a process called central sensitization. Pain resulting from altered pain processing “means there’s no clear injury or nerve damage,” says Christopher Robinson, a physician-scientist in the department of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y35EODHFTNFE3DEXTGICPHBYCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pain reprocessing therapy is an emerging technique that helps the brain “unlearn” this type of pain. Therapists have people engage in movement they fear will cause pain — such as bending — while training them to perceive their sensations as a result of nondangerous brain activity rather than tissue damage. It aims to silence what may be thought of as a false alarm from the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DYPWMUBXW5A2FGNPR63ZFFM34Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8482298/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; found that two-thirds of people with chronic back pain who received four weeks of pain reprocessing therapy were pain-free or nearly pain-free after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hyvuql-isBold-true wpds-c-esEUdQ-ieHKbcq-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2025, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-ifBuccc-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

ROACH: I am a 75-year-old woman in reasonably good health. Two months ago, I had a seizure in my doctor’s office during my annual checkup. I woke up in an emergency room in a large metropolitan hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IHBMSG5AEJE6ZFPJKTXHW4LCKQ"&gt;I take ramipril for high blood pressure, which is controlled. I am now taking levetiracetam for seizures. I have never had a seizure before and know of no one in my family who has had one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z7VRDQFZPJFG7G7BABEP3BOCSY"&gt;Initially I had a CT scan that showed nothing. Two weeks later, I had an electroencephalogram (EEG) that was clear and an MRI. No tumors or aneurysms were found. I am waiting to have a follow-up consultation with the neurology department. All my blood work was fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="H67JCVKORZHYVNCQFEOTHVAPBE"&gt;My own general physician said that there might be an age-related disease in the small blood vessels of my brain. What does this mean? She would offer no more information. I suppose she thinks that I should see the assigned neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J2AVVHSEXNG4ZHUFAUYCF6QJYA"&gt;I am in shock about this latest development in my health. I had low to normal blood pressure until I turned 70. In January, I had the worst case of the flu (worse than COVID). I was tested for COVID and was negative. Could this flu have been a factor in my having the seizure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PU67WI2MVVEEVH3Z6ZRXFREF5E"&gt;Is there anything that you can suggest to prevent further seizures? I’ve had no symptoms since and seem to be tolerating the medication well. -- D.M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JLPIYXSVFVA5JNC2PJC2IJEDTA"&gt;ANSWER: A new onset of a seizure in a person aged 75 is very concerning, and a thorough evaluation is mandatory. There are many possible causes, and one of them is a tumor, which is one reason they did the MRI. It’s very good news that there was no tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IEMHFYEJAFCSBNQAVDDT6DNQKM"&gt;Age-related changes in an MRI are common, and if there has been damage to the brain due to blood vessel changes, this can be a source of seizures. (Between 30% and 50% of new seizures in older adults are due to blood vessel disease.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OGTGANZ64RFRRJSRIHT7I2I444"&gt;COVID, especially severe COVID, can cause damage to the blood vessels. Most cases of the flu are less inflammatory than COVID, but I suppose it is possible that the flu affected the small blood vessels in your brain. However, if the small blood vessels in your brain really are damaged, I think it more likely that the high blood pressure caused the damage to the blood vessels from when your blood pressure wasn’t as well-controlled than it being due to COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A5ITSDJCMJATTIGVNRLDMXDOEU"&gt;However, many times we cannot find an answer as to why a person has a seizure. As far as treatment, I, too, would await the decision of the epilepsy-trained neurologist, but most recommendations I read would defer long-term treatment in a person with only one seizure when no cause can be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5JHLXZZAUJGKZPGALAJZSZONEU"&gt;A normal EEG also tends to make me think that the expert would recommend that you hold off on immediate treatment unless you have a second seizure. Still, the neurologist will look at all your data, especially the brain and blood vessel imaging, then give you a recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;CORRECTION: In the July 10 column, we stated that vitamin D “may help people with high-risk prediabetes develop overt diabetes.” It should have read “prevent” rather than “develop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FETIGQSX7RGXHCUX6Z6GTOB25Q"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

			&lt;p&gt;The passage of time may be linear, but the course of human aging is not. Rather than a gradual transition, your life staggers and lurches through the rapid growth of childhood, the plateau of early adulthood, to an acceleration in aging as the decades progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study has identified a turning point at which that acceleration typically takes place: at around age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this time, the trajectory at which your tissues and organs age is steeper than the decades preceding, according to a study of proteins in human bodies across a wide range of adult ages – and your veins are among the fastest to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on aging-associated protein changes, we developed tissue-specific proteomic age clocks and characterized organ-level aging trajectories. Temporal analysis revealed an aging inflection around age 50, with blood vessels being a tissue that ages early and is markedly susceptible to aging,"&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.047"&gt; writes a team&lt;/a&gt; led by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Together, our findings lay the groundwork for a systems-level understanding of human aging through the lens of proteins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Study Finds Humans Age Faster at 2 Sharp Peaks – Here's When&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-long-could-the-human-lifespan-get-the-answer-may-surprise-you"&gt;remarkably long lifespan&lt;/a&gt; compared to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-animals-lifespan-hints-at-how-well-it-copes-with-climate-change-says-study"&gt;most other mammals&lt;/a&gt;, but it comes at some costs. One is a decline in organ function, leading to a rise in risk of chronic disease as the years mount up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't have a very good understanding of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-major-feature-of-aging-might-not-be-universal-after-all"&gt;patterns of aging&lt;/a&gt; in individual organs, so the researchers investigated how proteins in different tissues change over time. They collected tissue samples from a total of 76 organ donors between the ages of 14 and 68 who had died of accidental traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These samples covered seven of the body's systems: cardiovascular (heart and aorta), digestive (liver, pancreas, and intestine), immune (spleen and lymph node), endocrine (adrenal gland and white adipose), respiratory (lung), integumentary (skin), and musculoskeletal (muscle). They also took blood samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team constructed a catalogue of the proteins found in these systems, taking careful note of how their levels changed as the ages of the donors increased. The researchers compared their findings to a database of diseases and their associated genes, and found that expressions of 48 disease-related proteins increased with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/forever-chemicals-could-be-putting-us-at-greater-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;, tissue fibrosis, fatty liver disease, and liver-related tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most stark changes occurred between the ages of 45 and 55, the researchers found. It's at this point that many tissues undergo substantial proteomic remodeling, with the most marked changes occurring in the aorta – demonstrating a strong susceptibility to aging. The pancreas and spleen also showed sustained change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169242" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169242" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642.jpg" alt="Study Reveals Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Suddenly Accelerates" class="wp-image-169242 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642-428x415.jpg 428w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/times_aging_organs_642-600x581.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169242" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Your body's organs according to ages they're most sensitive to aging. (Ding et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their findings, the researchers isolated a protein associated with aging in the aortas of mice, and injected it into young mice to observe the results. Test animals treated with the protein had reduced physical performance, decreased grip strength, lower endurance, and lower balance and coordination compared to non-treated mice. They also had prominent markers of vascular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-finds-humans-age-faster-at-2-sharp-peaks-heres-when"&gt;Previous work by other researchers&lt;/a&gt; showed another two peaks in aging, at around 44, and again at around 60. The new result suggests that human aging is a complicated, step-wise process involving different systems. Working out how aging is going to affect specific parts of the body at specific times could help develop medical interventions to make the process easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study is poised to construct a comprehensive multi-tissue proteomic atlas spanning 50 years of the entire human aging process, elucidating the mechanisms behind proteostasis imbalance in aged organs and revealing both universal and tissue-specific aging patterns," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.047"&gt;the researchers write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights may facilitate the development of targeted interventions for aging and age-related diseases, paving the way to improve the health of older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.047"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Some people can't start their day without a big breakfast first thing while others prefer to eat the most food at dinnertime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb39e7" class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, most people split their daily calorie intake up between three meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner (plus some snacks). Does it matter which &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/largest-meal-of-the-day-rcna219174" target="_blank"&gt;meal is the most caloric?&lt;/a&gt; Should you eat most of your calories for the day during a certain time window?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf328f" class="body-graf"&gt;In TODAY's expert tip, Collin Popp, Ph.D., dietitian and assistant professor at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, reveals how to time your daily calorie intake for the most health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ec8f9e" class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian Tip of the Day: Eat Majority of Your Calories Before Sunset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f12a27" class="body-graf"&gt;Most healthy adults should aim to get the majority of their calories earlier in the day, between the morning and early evening, about 5–7 p.m., Popp tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3ed13a" class="body-graf"&gt;If you eat three main meals a day, that would mean breakfast and lunch are your largest or most caloric meals, compared to dinner and late-night snacks, Popp explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5f341c" class="body-graf"&gt;If you tend to eat many smaller meals throughout the day, then try to shift these earlier so you only eat a minority of calories past the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-749330" class="body-graf"&gt;This timing of calorie intake, which Popp calls “front-loading," can be beneficial for your metabolic health, energy, blood sugar, and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b3b45d" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8441a1" class="body-graf"&gt;Eating most of your calories earlier in the day is optimal because it better aligns with the body’s 24-hour internal clock,  aka circadian rhythm, which regulates our sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f8d1f2" class="body-graf"&gt;Our circadian rhythm also regulates our metabolism, hunger and energy levels. The goal is to eat the majority of calories between the morning and early evening because our metabolic response is greater, so we're able to utilize more energy from food, says Popp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-989e99" class="body-graf"&gt;In healthy people, their insulin sensitivity — how well the body responds to the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar — is also higher in the morning, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-27e7af" class="body-graf"&gt;Front-loading calories can also help fuel our body and brain to get through the day and curb hunger, which may prevent overeating at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fbea66" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28701389" target="_blank"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; people who eat the majority of their calories at breakfast or lunch are more likely to lose weight than those who eat the most at dinnertime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af7003" class="body-graf"&gt;Consuming the majority of calories later in the day or during the night is not optimal for health for several reasons, says Popp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3513af" class="body-graf"&gt;First, back-loading calories at night can interfere with sleep and disrupt digestion. By not aligning with our circadian rhythm, the body may not metabolize food and use energy as efficiently. Eating the majority of calories at night is associated with weight gain and unstable blood sugar levels, especially for people with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-0b83e4" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56d5c5" class="body-graf"&gt;If you want to get a sense of how many calories you should be eating each day to maintain your current weight, you can use &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/bwp" target="_blank"&gt;this calculator from the National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ba68f" class="body-graf"&gt;Counting calories isn’t for everyone — fortunately, this tip only requires timing the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;majority (more than 50%) of your calories, says Popp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fedddf" class="body-graf"&gt;Here's an easy way to break down your daily calories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-7663ad" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Breakfast is 25-40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-lunch-to-lose-weight-rcna171471" target="_blank"&gt;Lunch&lt;/a&gt; is 30-40%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dinner is 15–20%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Snacks make up the remaining.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf277e" class="body-graf"&gt;During each meal — but especially breakfast and lunch — aim to get enough protein, healthy fats and fiber, says Popp. Try to eat &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/protein-grams-per-meal-rcna197039" target="_blank"&gt;20–30 grams of protein per meal&lt;/a&gt; and 8-10 grams of fiber per meal (based on a recommendation of &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/longevity-expert-tip-fiber-chronic-disease-rcna208086" target="_blank"&gt;25-30 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-370567" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

It was June 2021, and after months of virtual kindergarten, they sent their then-almost-6-year-old daughter to a summer program at a local school. The camp would be a brief reprieve before Amelia, an only child, started first grade, and Laura was sure she would love it. She was outgoing, the kind of kid who didn’t hesitate to approach someone new on the playground and start a game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizur1000q3b7877axe2h5@published" data-word-count="78"&gt;So Laura was surprised when, after the first day, Amelia told her she didn’t want to go back. At pickup a few days later, she pleaded again not to return. She said the woman who ran the camp often yelled and, at lunchtime, wouldn’t let Amelia leave the table until she finished all her food. Laura spoke to the woman — Amelia didn’t need to eat every morsel, she told her — and assumed the problem was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizuug000r3b78squ06w6x@published" data-word-count="91"&gt;Camp ended, but over the next 12 months, Amelia would sometimes stuff her mouth with food, panic that it was too much to swallow, and spit it out. Laura told Amelia she needed to chew her food properly or she could choke. Amelia asked what would happen next. Two close family members had fallen severely ill with COVID, and one of them had died. Amelia became fixated on death. She wanted to know: What happens when you choke? You can’t breathe? Well, what happens if you can’t breathe? Then you die?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizuy2000s3b78q31jebpw@published" data-word-count="181"&gt;Amelia hadn’t been an anxious child, but she became increasingly sensitive to the world around her. She tensed up when people talked sternly; once, when a substitute instructor shouted in gymnastics class, Amelia rushed over to Laura and, through tears, begged to leave immediately. Her clothes started to bother her. At first, she didn’t want to wear dresses. Then she would wear only certain pants and a select few shirts. By the start of 2023, she was down to one outfit that Laura and Mark washed daily: a pair of fuzzy blue Cat &amp;amp; Jack pajamas with stars and planets and the cotton underwear she insisted felt more comfortable than all the others. When she tried to put on school clothes, “she’d work herself into a panic attack,” said Mark. “She’d say, ‘It’s too itchy. It’s too scratchy. It’s too tight. I can’t wear it. It hurts.’” At night, Amelia resisted falling asleep, convinced that if she closed her eyes, she might not wake up. Mark and Laura took turns in her room until she drifted off, which left everyone drained.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv1i000t3b78fs3ofxoz@published" data-word-count="102"&gt;Her parents had her evaluated for autism, but doctors determined that while Amelia was hypersensitive, her behavior was rooted in anxiety. This made sense to Mark and Laura: Studies suggest that generalized anxiety disorder may run in families, and Laura had been diagnosed years earlier. As a child, she had an outsize fear of death; in adulthood, she tended to operate as though “everything is a fire drill,” she told me. If it took Amelia too long to get her shoes on or eat breakfast, Laura would grow frantic, worried that her daughter would be late for school and get in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv4q000u3b78gr5lctu9@published" data-word-count="103"&gt;One day in January 2023, Amelia overheard Mark and Laura discussing the sign-up deadlines for different summer camps and began to fret. That evening, while eating a chicken nugget, she yelled out to Laura that she was choking. She had recently watched an episode of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Baby-Sitters Club&lt;/em&gt; in which a character chokes on her dinner. That part of the scene lasts only ten seconds, but the camera focuses on the girl’s terrified face while she struggles to breathe. Amelia wasn’t actually choking — she could speak — but her whole body had clenched and made her feel as though she couldn’t swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizv8z000v3b78t19j76t4@published" data-word-count="110"&gt;Previously, Amelia ate a wide-ranging diet, but after the chicken-nugget incident, she began to refuse solid foods. Within a week, she would consume only yogurt and liquids. “We would buy every drink that she could possibly want — chocolate milk, juice. We were desperate,” said Laura. “And it got worse every single day.” Amelia cut out the yogurt, convinced she would choke on it. A couple of weeks later, she rejected liquids, too. She began spitting into a napkin, unable to swallow her own saliva. It felt like something was stuck in her throat, Amelia said. She believed if she did try to swallow, she would choke, suffocate, and die.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvc7000w3b786clevvhe@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;Dinner turned into a nightly standoff: Amelia on one side of the table, growing thinner and frailer, Mark and Laura on the other, their panic mounting. Sometimes, they tried coaxing her. Other times, they couldn’t help but yell. “We didn’t know how to deal with it. Like, ‘Why can’t you eat?’” said Laura. It felt like a failure. They tried to quiet their terror by leaning on what one may believe to be a biological fact — that humans are wired for survival and, eventually, a child will get hungry and want food. “I kept thinking, &lt;em&gt;Mother Nature’s going to kick in here,&lt;/em&gt;” said Mark, who asked that his family’s names be changed owing to the detailed account of his daughter’s medical history being shared. (Some other names have also been changed.) Instead, Amelia’s hunger response seemed to have shut off. If they tried to feed her, she would spit out the food.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvf9000x3b78wz9fk4xj@published" data-word-count="84"&gt;Doctors looked for a physical explanation for Amelia’s sudden inability to swallow. At urgent care, providers said they didn’t see any obstruction and told Mark and Laura to contact Amelia’s pediatrician, though when they called to set up an appointment, the pediatrician had no immediate availability. An ear-nose-and-throat specialist suggested Amelia might have eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammatory condition that can be triggered by allergies or acid reflux. That doctor sent them home with nasal spray and antacids and suggested they see an allergist.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvoc000y3b78uugeipcs@published" data-word-count="77"&gt;By the end of that February, roughly a month after she had stopped eating normally, Amelia weighed 37 pounds. Mark and Laura called doctor after doctor, including multiple psychologists, but those listed under their insurance no longer accepted their plan, didn’t treat patients that young, or couldn’t see them for six months. Amelia, increasingly malnourished, began screaming, cursing, and throwing things. “She was just turning into an animal,” said Mark. “We did not recognize our own daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvrs000z3b788fmjf2sa@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;The morning of February 22, Mark and Laura took Amelia to the emergency room. Doctors were alarmed — a blood test showed Amelia was in danger of heart failure. They transferred her to a hospital with a pediatric department, where a gastroenterologist inserted a feeding tube up her nose and into her stomach, allowing her to consume a nutrient-rich formula without swallowing. An endoscopy again confirmed the absence of a physical obstruction or abnormality. Finally, a doctor sat down with Mark and Laura and gave them a name for what their daughter was experiencing. They suspected that Amelia had &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/arfid-childrens-eating-disorder-vs-picky-eating.html"&gt;ARFID&lt;/a&gt;, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, a psychiatric diagnosis, often emerging in childhood, that can range from eating a very limited number of foods to refusing food altogether. Like many other parents, Mark and Laura hadn’t heard of ARFID. It seemed the numerous doctors who had seen Amelia over the past month hadn’t either.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvvh00103b78pa36oqi3@published" data-word-count="156"&gt;ARFID is a fairly new addition to the modern parenting lexicon: A behavior far more severe than pickiness, it’s an eating disorder provoked not by the desire to change one’s body but by the fear of food itself. Only in the past few years has the acronym begun circulating on playgrounds and in school nurses’ offices, and it’s not uncommon for parents to first stumble upon it on their own — on Reddit threads, in Facebook groups, on Instagram or TikTok. (This month, &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives of Orange County&lt;/em&gt; star Emily Simpson shared that her 10-year-old son has the disorder.) One mother told me she’d learned about ARFID after searching online, “Why is my 5-year-old eating absolutely nothing?” “&lt;em&gt;Bulimia&lt;/em&gt; came up. He doesn’t have bulimia,” she said. “Then I saw &lt;em&gt;anorexia,&lt;/em&gt; and I was like, &lt;em&gt;He doesn’t have anorexia.&lt;/em&gt; And then I scrolled more and it said, ‘Does your child have ARFID?’ And he had every symptom.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizvyp00113b783u8i4nop@published" data-word-count="164"&gt;Doctors who specialize in eating disorders say they have seen an increase in diagnoses over the past several years, and a recent study found that, among children, the number of inpatient hospital discharges in which ARFID was the chief diagnosis doubled from 2017 to 2022. “There was this explosion almost six years ago, when we had a bunch of cases coming into the hospital,” said Heather Kertesz-Briest, a clinical psychologist who used to work at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Equip, a telehealth company specializing in eating disorders, treated more than 1,000 ARFID patients in 2024 — a 144 percent bump from the previous year. And Beat, a U.K.-based charity that runs eating-disorder hotlines, reports that there were nearly seven times as many calls about ARFID in 2023 than in 2018. There is limited data available, but one review estimates that up to 5 percent of the population has it, and a 2023 screen of 50,000 adults suggests it may be as common as anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizw7q00123b78f0nsw6ni@published" data-word-count="130"&gt;While classified as an eating disorder, ARFID may be more easily understood in many children as an anxiety disorder that centers on food. Its rise coincides with a pediatric diagnostic boom in mental-health conditions as more and more children are treated for generalized anxiety disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and ADHD — raising the question of whether they are a generation maladapted to the world around them or the first generation to be thoroughly understood. ARFID often orbits these diagnoses, a disorder that can become the most physical manifestation of what’s happening in a child’s mind. “That primal instinct to feed your kid, that is millions of years of evolution,” Mark said. “It’s scary for your kid to not eat and not drink and to not understand, &lt;em&gt;What’s going on here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

For decades, health professionals working in hospitals and eating-disorder clinics encountered patients who were severely underweight from not eating but who didn’t qualify for an anorexia diagnosis because they weren’t trying to lose weight or grappling with body dysmorphia — instead, they were disinterested in food, felt disgusted by it, or feared it. Twenty years ago, “the way we thought about some cases was that maybe the patient has anorexia secretly but they have a lack of insight into it,” said Jennifer Thomas, a psychologist and co-director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwhm00153b784h3w8l2g@published" data-word-count="179"&gt;Until 2013, the year ARFID entered the fifth edition of the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&lt;/em&gt; the closest label was “feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood,” a code for children under 6. But the age cap made the label inapplicable to many patients, and it wasn’t widely used or researched. Unable to find meaningful literature on the condition, authors of the &lt;em&gt;DSM-5 &lt;/em&gt;spoke with psychologists and doctors who worked with eating-disorder patients and identified a specific patient profile: a person with sufficient access to food who wasn’t concerned with altering their body shape, and who restricted or avoided eating to a point where they lost significant weight, didn’t get enough nutrients, and/or experienced mental and social distress. These patients were, on average, younger and more likely to be male than those with anorexia. They lived not just in North America and Europe but also in Oceania, Southeast Asia, and Japan. When Thomas and her colleague eventually published a treatment manual for ARFID, they quickly got requests for editions in other languages, including Turkish, Italian, and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwkv00163b783dzfcu73@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;DSM-5&lt;/em&gt; authors identified three presentations of ARFID, which themselves can feel like different diagnoses, though some patients fall into more than one category. One subgroup is made up of those who are simply uninterested in food, often from birth. Many were, as newborns, admitted into neonatal-intensive-care units, where they were put on feeding tubes. The tubes are lifesaving, but they bypass the tactile experience of eating, which can lead to an oral aversion. Some tube-fed babies struggle to develop hunger cues or learn the mechanics of swallowing. Years later, they may still lack the two major motivators to eat: They don’t feel hunger, and they don’t enjoy food.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwo100173b78geng0sur@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;A second category is made up of people who have a sensory aversion: They tolerate certain tastes, smells, temperatures, and textures and feel disgusted by most everything else. Many of these patients are neurodiverse, and while it’s common for people with autism to have sensory sensitivity to food, “where ARFID rears its head is when the sensory experience is so discordant, so displeasurable, that it creates a full-body anxiety response,” said Matt Zakreski, a clinical psychologist who specializes in neuropsychological developmental disorders. “It’s analogous to the difference between having seasonal allergies and having anaphylactic shock.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizwy200183b7850acp2vk@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;The most sudden ARFID cases fall into a third group: children like Amelia who develop a fear around eating, often after experiencing a traumatic event. Kellee Lanza-Bolen, a mother in Virginia, said her 8-year-old daughter stopped eating after choking on gummy candy she got in her Christmas stocking. The next month, her daughter was admitted to the hospital, where she was eventually diagnosed with ARFID and put on a feeding tube. Lanza-Bolen was confused; she had seen videos of Hannah Lea, a 9-year-old girl who chronicles her life with ARFID on Instagram and TikTok. But Hannah has sensory-processing issues. “When I heard ARFID, I said, ‘Well, no, because my kid doesn’t have sensory issues,’” Lanza-Bolen said. Her understanding of the disorder shifted once she learned it can be a response to a harrowing experience, similar to a person who becomes terrified of driving after a car accident. She now compares her daughter’s anxiety around swallowing to “the same fear that keeps you from getting too close to the edge of a balcony or the top of a building.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizx1o00193b78ekjy0eyx@published" data-word-count="213"&gt;As the disorder gained recognition, diagnoses naturally increased. The way Zakreski sees it, the embrace of the label stems from clinicians developing a more holistic understanding of the brain. “For a long time, we treated mental health through the medical model: You have a broken ankle, that’s it. You have pneumonia, that’s it,” he said. “Now, we know that any change to the brain predicts a lot of other changes, that one neurodivergence predicts other neurodivergences at a significantly higher rate.” One study, for example, suggests more than half of ARFID patients have autism, a disorder with a strong hereditary link and rising diagnostic rates. In Kertesz-Briest’s practice, nearly every single child with ARFID she sees also has an anxiety disorder, the most common mental-health diagnosis in adolescents. Meanwhile, food allergies, which can make eating feel like a fearsome game of roulette, are increasingly common among children, and William Sharp, the director of the Multidisciplinary Feeding Program at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, said it’s no coincidence that more than 30 percent of his patients with a food allergy likely also have ARFID. Premature birth is also a known risk factor for feeding problems that can develop into ARFID, and as of 2023, nearly 10 percent of newborns are admitted into a neonatal-intensive-care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

And at a time when parenting culture is more attentive and anxiety-ridden than ever, the mystery ARFID presents mirrors the larger questions at the top of every parent’s mind today: How much control do we have over our children, or how much control should we exert? When does our vigilance contribute to our children’s anxieties, and when is it the only thing keeping them alive?&lt;/p&gt;

The clinic was disorienting. Amelia was the only 7-year-old there, and in the waiting room, her family found themselves sitting between toddlers with feeding issues and tween and teen girls. Mark gazed at the other parents, all of whom looked “like a bomb had gone off,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxgd001d3b78pt6sld9p@published" data-word-count="176"&gt;For the next few weeks, he and Laura split their time between the clinic and their home, three hours away with traffic. Their marriage, bruised by the past few months, began to buckle. “We had a ton of angst about, &lt;em&gt;How did we mess up our daughter?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;” said Mark. “When your kid gets cancer, you can’t blame your spouse. When your kid has something more psychological, you start asking, &lt;em&gt;Did I cause this? Was this something I did or said? Was it something my spouse did or said?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;” Laura worried that Mark’s frustration with Amelia — he had gone from being the calm, steady parent to raising his voice — had unnerved her. Mark worried that it was Laura’s anxiety that had rubbed off. “Why did you tell her she’s going to die from choking?” he asked. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Amelia was in constant agitation. She tried to rip out her feeding tube. She screamed and spit, asking why the doctors weren’t helping her. Her mind was still making her body believe she couldn’t swallow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxjp001e3b78xf97x1dy@published" data-word-count="180"&gt;ARFID, like the diagnoses it often accompanies, exists along a wide spectrum, with cases like Amelia’s at the most severe end. Many children with the disorder will eat but only from a very short list of foods. Those with a sensory aversion in particular tend to have rigid preferences, almost always gravitating toward carbohydrates. Jennifer Thomas, the psychologist who published the ARFID treatment manual, said this is true across cultures: In Boston, where she is based, the food of choice is Annie’s macaroni and cheese, while colleagues in Mexico see a preference for tortillas, and in Asia and the Middle East, rice. Processed and packaged foods — consistent in shape, size, and taste — are also deemed “safe” by children with ARFID, and doctors in the U.S. see a strong proclivity for McDonald’s chicken nuggets and frozen dinosaur-shaped nuggets. The difference between “safe” and “unsafe” can be minute — at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, kids getting treated for ARFID stopped eating the puréed chicken nuggets they had been consuming for weeks when the brand the hospital used tweaked its recipe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxmt001f3b78nn4rgp6a@published" data-word-count="101"&gt;In many ways, these cases can prove the most challenging to navigate. A child who won’t eat at all presents a clear crisis, while a child who eats a few specific foods and isn’t in imminent danger of starvation leaves more room to question what’s pathological and what’s not, what may just be a child asserting their independence and what warrants medical attention. Plenty of general practitioners still aren’t aware of ARFID, and one study found it can take almost three years to get a diagnosis after the onset of symptoms, more than double the average time for someone with anorexia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxq4001g3b78oyb13tpi@published" data-word-count="189"&gt;Sarah, a mother in New York, was alarmed to learn from a teacher that her daughter, then in preschool, had been eating only apples for lunch and refusing everything else. The pediatrician assured her and her husband it would pass — in the doctor’s office, “the philosophy was ‘Well, she’ll eventually get hungry and eat the food that’s on the table,’” Sarah said. Maybe, they thought, their daughter was simply strong-willed. They agreed that accommodating her increasingly specific food requests would reinforce the behavior. Her diet moderately expanded. But when she was 8, she was being bullied at school, the family’s nanny left, and suddenly she wanted only applesauce for two weeks, saying anything else “hurts my body.” One night, when getting her daughter dressed for bed, Sarah was startled to see how thin she had gotten. At an eating-disorder clinic, Sarah’s daughter was diagnosed with ARFID. Later, after a full psychological evaluation, she was also diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder and flagged for possible autism. Now, Sarah stays alert to when her daughter wants more applesauce than usual, mindful that it could be a warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;

When Tania of Perth, Australia, got pregnant at 38, she decided motherhood “would be my next career.” She took courses on sleep training, read parenting books, learned how to blend her own purées. But after a traumatic birth that broke her son’s collarbone, followed by a series of respiratory infections and a tonsillectomy, her son, now 5, didn’t take to food, accepting only milk and bread. When she put blueberries on his plate, he would pretend to eat them before throwing them on the floor. Instead of bonding with her son at mealtimes as she had envisioned, Tania began to anticipate his resistance. Once, she said, “I put the food on the table and burst into tears.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizxx9001i3b78uf58xq9h@published" data-word-count="82"&gt;Tania and her son’s world grew smaller. Mommy-and-me classes were stressful; he tired out easily from not eating enough, and she felt embarrassed when other parents pulled out lunch boxes with fresh fruit while her child ate only puffed snacks. Finally, a dietitian recommended a book called &lt;em&gt;Helping Your Child With Extreme Picky Eating,&lt;/em&gt; which described ARFID and included a chapter on parents blaming themselves for their child’s difficulty with food. Upon reading it, Tania said, “weights were lifted from my shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;

They worry that fellow parents think they’re lazy and don’t want to cook or that their whole family must subsist on Goldfish and chicken nuggets. (Some patients who eat a rigid diet of high-fat or high-carb foods may even be overweight. In a private ARFID Facebook group, a few parents post about their children being diagnosed with diabetes.) “Parents say to me, ‘Well, you just need to make sure they eat variety,’” said Sarah. While her daughter has ARFID, her other child eats almost anything. “I’m like, &lt;em&gt;We have all the fresh fruits and vegetables. My kids were raised exactly the same.&lt;/em&gt; In terms of nature versus nurture, their nature is completely different.” One Christmas Eve after being pressured to eat, her daughter with ARFID began hyperventilating at the table in front of their extended family. A relative pulled Sarah aside and told her such a disturbance can never happen again. “They think it’s misbehavior, that we aren’t disciplining her,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

As a newborn, her son had been put on a feeding tube; at 5, he suddenly stopped eating the short list of foods he had once tolerated. Mealtimes became “a fight to get every calorie into him. It was begging, pleading,” she said. Even after undergoing treatment, her son, now 7, still negotiates every bite. “He argues with us, like, ‘Well, if I eat this, how long will that give me to live?’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizy7v001l3b780zh1mx7j@published" data-word-count="173"&gt;To an outsider, these cases may look like choosiness or defiance, but “ ‘picky eating’ undermines how severe this is,” said Sharp, the director at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. “We’re seeing kids with autism who only eat two foods. These kids develop rickets; they develop scurvy.” In extremely rare instances, the malnutrition can become fatal. Lucy Morrison, a mother in the U.K., told me about her son, Alfie, who had nonspeaking autism and restricted his eating for his entire life, primarily consuming baby crackers and porridge. In 2021, Alfie fell off a small bench at school and began limping, then grew increasingly lethargic. A week later, he had stopped eating anything, but the pediatrician told her, “He’s acting like that because of his autism.” A few days later, Alfie, 7, went into cardiac arrest and died. Only two years later was it determined that the malnutrition brought about by ARFID had caused his heart to stop. Lucy said the first person to tell her the diagnosis was the coroner tasked with investigating his death.&lt;/p&gt;

Grace ordered soup and a coffee, but her son, then 10, had already eaten his standard morning meal of glazed doughnuts from the Dunkin’ near their home; he says he can tell when a doughnut is made at other locations. The boy, who has been diagnosed with ARFID, ADHD, and generalized anxiety disorder, was polite and matter-of-fact. He described how he lives with an almost constant, vague stomach discomfort that makes it hard to tell when he’s hungry. It’s exacerbated by the appetite-suppressing effects of the Ritalin he takes for ADHD and the constipation from his diet of processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;

But when he started day care, he refused to eat the provided lunches, holding out even as the teachers encouraged him with increasing desperation. Grace, who was working full time, started giving him packaged snacks on the drive home. Her son developed a strong affinity for them and began rejecting most other food — a behavior that worsened over time. Now, while the rest of the family has dinner, he eats his own meal of McDonald’s chicken nuggets and French fries with Sprite. At school, the smells in the lunchroom are sensory overload, so his safe foods are kept in the nurse’s office: gummy bears and sour gummy worms, Cheez-Its, Oreos, and Pirate’s Booty. He takes multivitamins to supplement nutrients. Grace has two degrees, one in psychology, and she knows how this sounds. Still, she said, what else can she do? Her son doesn’t have hunger cues, and without his preferred foods, he simply won’t eat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizype001p3b78kl9oj7mc@published" data-word-count="223"&gt;ARFID’s emergence as a diagnosis coincided with a seismic shift in parenting culture. “We know so much more about the brain now than we did 30 to 40 years ago, and we’re raising our kids with a better understanding of how their brain develops, including their emotional-regulation skills and sensory processing,” said Kertesz-Briest, the clinical psychologist. Behaviors that past generations of parents might have viewed as “bad” and warranting punishment are today apprehended through a more compassionate lens. One woman I spoke with, who has a son with ARFID and generalized anxiety disorder, often thinks of the way her parents got her sister to eat when they were young. Her sister was picky, and their parents did “the same thing any parent in the ’80s did, which was to say, ‘Sit here and finish your food, and you can’t leave the table until you do.’” It would be a disaster with her son, she said. Studies show that parents’ forcing children to eat at mealtime can make them want to eat even less, and, for her son, “it would turn into a panic attack,” the mother said. “He would cry, he would vomit. It wouldn’t be about food anymore. It would be about torturing someone who isn’t trying to perpetrate a power struggle. He’s just refusing the food because he’s terrified of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizysl001q3b784lii0w44@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;When a child won’t eat, it’s a natural reflex to find something — anything — that might give them sustenance. Many parents dealing with ARFID learn to anticipate their child’s reactions before a meal, trying to solve for every outcome: What can I serve that my child won’t refuse? What if she eats nothing? Will it turn into a fight? Parents of children with a sensory aversion to food describe going to great lengths to remove, say, a brown spot from a French fry or to mix pancake batter in just the right ratio and pour it into the only acceptable shape, all to provide the consistency that might make their child want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizyzy001r3b789gl3yufr@published" data-word-count="154"&gt;But while applying pressure can be counterproductive, specialists say that accommodating a child’s preferences entirely can lead to more rigidity, too. When ARFID appears with anxiety, the cycle, Kertesz-Briest said, goes like this: “We experience the fear stimulus, we avoid it, we feel better. We face it again, we avoid it, we feel better. The more we avoid, the scarier something becomes. In the case of ARFID, even avoiding one bite of one food one time can be what knocks it off the safe-food list.” She continues, “For parents who have kids with anxiety disorders, sometimes unknowingly we collude with the anxiety or we collude with the ARFID. The parent thinks, &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; know my kid will eat this one food, so I’m giving only this food to them,&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I don’t want my kid to feel scared or uncomfortable, so I remove the discomfort right away.&lt;/em&gt; It’s a hard cycle to break out of.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizz4r001s3b784emuxshg@published" data-word-count="180"&gt;Parents don’t cause ARFID, but in their hypervigilance, their pursuit to help or protect their children, they can sometimes entrench it. “This is a very anxious parenting generation,” Zakreski, the clinical psychologist, told me. “You could make the argument that we are too attuned to our kids, that we are not really willing to challenge them in ways previous generations were.” (He’s not immune to this either, he admits — sometimes, he makes pasta three different ways for the same meal to appease his two children.) The modern food landscape doesn’t help. Restaurants, no matter the cuisine, attract parents with kids’ menus: a reliable list of mac ’n’ cheese, pizza, hot dogs, and chicken fingers. At the grocery store, entire shelves are dedicated to packaged snacks created specifically for children. “If you were somebody who had a tough time with milk and you were growing up in the ’80s, you were on your own,” said Zakreski. “Now, it’s like, ‘Do you want the oat milk? The almond milk?’” For some children, he said, more options increases the risk of ARFID.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzax001t3b785nfku3q3@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;Meanwhile, doctors are increasingly aware of how other family dynamics — especially parents’ stress about their child not eating — can reinforce the disorder. During mealtimes, “the kids feel the parent’s anxiety, even if the parent is trying to contain it,” said Wendy Nash Moyal, a psychiatrist who specializes in autism, OCD, ADHD, anxiety, and learning disorders. “So the child with ARFID experiences whole-body tension — the feeling that their throat is going to close up more. The child’s anxiety and the parent’s anxiety, both things are going to exacerbate the ARFID symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizze8001u3b78jqbso40a@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;Sharp of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta has also observed how a parent’s trepidation around their child’s eating can “spill over” onto that child. Two years ago, he saw a young patient with a severe food allergy. The boy had long restricted his diet, but after getting a stomach bug, he stopped eating his safe foods altogether. “The dad said, ‘I think I created this,’” Sharp recalled. Long before the stomach bug, his son had gone into anaphylaxis, and the father, terrified, became extremely vigilant about the foods his son ate. Now, he worried his vigilance might have contributed to his son’s anxiety. “And I said, ‘It’s not your fault. You didn’t know what to do, and this is scary.’”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzhf001v3b78vnofpz13@published" data-word-count="145"&gt;At the restaurant, Grace acknowledged that she and her husband “do accommodate. We bend more than I guess a regular parent would.” Still, her pediatric endocrinologist is more concerned with her son’s growth than with his nutrition; blood tests show the boy has started puberty and, already short for his age, has grown only an inch in the past year — half of the minimum expected. “She’s panicking,” Grace said. For the better part of seven years, she has been taking her son from specialist to specialist without much improvement. She suspects there are people who blame her, but she also knows that while her son may not be eating a healthy, balanced diet, he’s not in a hospital, not on a feeding tube, and not relying on shakes for sustenance. “So if it’s just me feeding him lots of junk food, I don’t care.”&lt;/p&gt;

She still wouldn’t swallow anything, including water, so nurses met with Mark and Laura and trained them in how to use the feeding-tube equipment. Amelia’s psychiatrist prescribed an antipsychotic medication that balances dopamine and serotonin in the brain, along with an anti-anxiety medication. Drugs are not always used with ARFID patients, but in some cases, they can address a separate issue, like severe anxiety, that may be adding to the patient’s restrictive eating. Laura is a former pharmacist who is “very anti-drug” — the idea of putting their already small and weak daughter on psychiatric medication with potential side effects was scary, but ultimately she and Mark decided it was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzr6001y3b78ee21jtvq@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;Amelia was 40 pounds when she walked into school for the first time in a month. She was allowed to keep a small trash can next to her desk to spit in, and Mark would come in at lunchtime to give her food, fluids, and medication. At home, she continued the treatments she had begun in the hospital. With Kertesz-Briest, who is her psychologist, Amelia underwent cognitive behavioral therapy, a common treatment for other eating disorders that is currently one of the most promising interventions for ARFID. In CBT, a patient identifies their fears around eating, is exposed to different foods and tested on their negative predictions, and learns coping skills for periods of distress. She also attended regular feeding-therapy sessions, which, depending on the patient, can focus on the mechanics of chewing and swallowing or the sensory experience of eating — the way different foods smell or feel. In one session, Amelia cut pictures of food from magazines and organized them from easiest to swallow to most difficult to swallow, then made them into a game board.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjizzue001z3b78p6sss2ss@published" data-word-count="88"&gt;Laura and Mark participated in the family- and feeding-therapy sessions too. They learned to serve small portions so as not to overwhelm her, to tell her she was safe when she struggled to eat rather than to pressure her, and to allow some distractions, including an iPad, which can be a helpful diversion for ARFID patients even if it goes against today’s no-screens mantra. They learned to adjust their language around eating, like coming up with a code word for dinner to alleviate some of the negative associations.&lt;/p&gt;

Laura had been devastated to learn that, several months earlier, Amelia hadn’t wanted to leave the hospital — she felt scared at home with all the yelling. Laura, for her part, had begun to feel as though she and Mark had lost their ability to communicate; she had been thinking about divorce. At Mark’s suggestion, they started couples counseling. For the first time, Laura took medication for her own anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

In a recent trial for ARFID patients ages 5 to 9, Nancy Zucker, a clinical psychologist and director of the Duke Center for Eating Disorders, focused on acknowledging and repairing the trauma experienced by both the child &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the parent as a result of the child not eating in order to ease their anxiety around mealtimes. For one of the activities, she had them cook together but not with the aim of taking a bite. With each positive experience, the child was instructed to put a marble in a jar. “It’s like the kid’s giving the parent a sticker,” Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;

Then she would regress and refuse even that. In therapy, she was learning coping mechanisms, breathing exercises, and new vocabulary to articulate how she was feeling. But she wasn’t putting them into practice in a way that resulted in the ultimate goal of eating or drinking. Mark and Laura, increasingly desperate and exhausted, started to make plans to readmit Amelia into an inpatient facility, and in August, a spot opened up at a highly regarded eating-disorder clinic. By then, Amelia’s psychiatrist had recommended weaning her off her existing medications and putting her on an SSRI. After more weeks of no improvement, he gradually increased the dosage until it was double.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj009p00233b78sl5ivzcp@published" data-word-count="75"&gt;Before they broke the news to Amelia that she would be going back to the hospital instead of to school, they decided to go on a hike with friends. It was hot, and the adults carried water bottles as they made their way up the trail. Amelia’s hydration still came from her feeding tube, taped to the small patch of skin below her nose. As they walked, Mark heard a small voice: “Dad, I’m thirsty.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00d200243b78ckf7gwnv@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;He looked around, checking that it hadn’t been one of their friends’ children. It was Amelia. “Oh, do you want some water?” he responded, trying to sound nonchalant. He handed her the bottle and watched in disbelief as she took one sip, then another, then another. The next day, they went to a noodle shop. Laura gave her a half-bowl. As Amelia slurped down her food, Mark and Laura squeezed each other’s hands beneath the table.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00g400253b78lqicf98z@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;Doctors warned them not to get too excited. ARFID can follow young people into adulthood, and regressions are common. Something as simple as a change in packaging can cause a child with ARFID to suddenly distrust a food they’ve been eating. Parents worry about their kid catching a stomach bug or having strep throat, which may set them back. But it was hard for Mark and Laura not to give in to optimism. They called the hospital and canceled Amelia’s upcoming stay and contacted the school to let them know she would be starting third grade. One week later, after Amelia kept asking when she could remove the feeding tube, Mark took it out. When they looked at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, they both cried.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00j300263b7803rssnr5@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;In his view, the SSRI calmed Amelia’s anxiety to the point where she was finally able to use the skills she had been learning for months in therapy. Nearly two years later, she’s still taking the medication, but her doctor has lowered the dosage. Mark is determined to get her off it altogether; one side effect of the higher SSRI dose was that Amelia started wetting her bed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmdjj00m500273b78fotdl409@published" data-word-count="129"&gt;Amelia eats more now — pasta, fruits, and even beef, pork, and fish — but she still has anxiety. They have stopped the feeding therapy, wanting to let her go back to just being a kid. The family is still uncovering the full extent of what they’ve been through; last year, Amelia stiffened when the Kylie Minogue track “Padam Padam” came on — it was one of the songs on the radio during her months in treatment. The word &lt;em&gt;choking&lt;/em&gt; is banned from their household. Amelia is happy at a new camp this summer. She loves anime and playing &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and dancing to K-pop. But Mark hasn’t shaken the fear that this isn’t the end. “Even talking about this now,” he said hesitantly, “I don’t want to jinx it.”&lt;/p&gt;

Keep scrolling for 14 myths about mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: All mosquitoes bite humans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Not all mosquitoes feed on blood,” Fredericks said. “The mosquito species that do bite require blood to develop their eggs. Mosquitoes actually feed on nectar and plant juices, just like butterflies.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that of the mosquitoes who do feed on blood, only females bite humans and other animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you get bitten or stung by any insect, it’s almost always a female,” said &lt;a href="https://entomology.umd.edu/st-leger-raymond-j.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Raymond J.

Factors like pregnancy, exercise and even whether you recently had an alcoholic drink play a much bigger role in whether a mosquito is attracted to you or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Mosquitoes won’t bite you through your clothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes can bite through thin or tight-fitting clothing,” Haines said. “Scientific &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/12/7/636" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687d751de4b06691ec24b461" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/12/7/636" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have demonstrated that mosquitoes can penetrate lightweight fabrics, with bite resistance depending on fabric thickness, pore size, and weave density rather than simply the presence of clothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added loose-fitting, tightly woven fabrics, or clothing that has been treated with insecticide are more effective at reducing mosquito bite risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Mosquitoes only bite at night.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;many mosquitoes are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;most &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;active at those times, several species are daytime biters that can cause &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;problems all day (and night) long,” Fredericks said. “Female mosquitoes feed on blood, which means they’re looking for meals whenever they prepare to reproduce.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asian tiger mosquitoes, for example, are active during the day, while Aedes aegypti have biting peaks in the morning and late afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different mosquitoes are active at different times of day, although most are active at dusk and dawn,” DeVries said. “Also, your environment can influence your exposure risk. Shady areas can lead to bites from mosquitoes outside of the times they are normally active. As such, you should always be aware of your surroundings and take appropriate measures to reduce being bitten, even in the middle of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Mosquito repellents are not effective.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some individuals will state that mosquito repellents are not effective,” said &lt;a href="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/profiles/AAshbrook" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Aaron Ashbrook" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687d751de4b06691ec24b461" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.lsuagcenter.com/profiles/AAshbrook" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Aaron Ashbrook&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of urban and peri-urban entomology at Louisiana State University. “However, EPE-approved mosquito repellents are tested for their efficacy ― otherwise, they cannot be labelled as a repellent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that mosquito repellent is often washed off by sweat and other forms of moisture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, it loses efficacy and needs to be reapplied if you are starting to be bitten by mosquitoes after the initial application,” Ashbrook said. “When I am out in the woods, I bring my repellent with me to reapply it as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: All mosquitoes carry and transmit diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes are considered by many to be the most dangerous animal on the planet due to the death they cause through transmission of things like malaria, dengue and West Nile,” DeVries said. “However, there are many mosquito species that either do not transmit diseases or are not good at transmitting diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Leger similarly emphasized that the many mosquito species differ in their ecologies and behaviors and that different species carry different diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A big surprise has been that despite their differences they all seem to be benefiting from how we are changing the world,” he added. “Much of the U.S. has become more hospitable to really dangerous disease-carriers like Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Joao Paulo Burini via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Joao Paulo Burini via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Mosquitoes can spread serious and potentially deadly illnesses like malaria, dengue and West Nile.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, DeVries explained that you need three things for disease transmission to occur ― a pathogen source, a viable host and a way of transmitting the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For mosquito-borne diseases that affect humans, the host (humans) and way of transmitting the disease (mosquito) are usually set, but often times the source is not,” he noted. “If you do not have the disease present, there can be no transmission. However, it is important to note that oftentimes the source can be introduced, leading to localized disease outbreaks as we often see in the U.S. with things like Zika and West Nile viruses.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: You’re safe from mosquitoes if you aren’t near swamps or wetlands. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The myth that mosquitoes only breed in dirty water is dangerous since it gives people a false sense of security,” Fredericks said. “The truth is mosquitoes can breed in any &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pestworld.org/news-hub/pest-articles/6-tips-to-keep-your-home-safe-from-pests-during-storms/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="standing water" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687d751de4b06691ec24b461" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.pestworld.org/news-hub/pest-articles/6-tips-to-keep-your-home-safe-from-pests-during-storms/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;standing water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, clean or dirty. All they need is half an inch of standing water to lay their eggs. That’s the size of a water bottle cap. Our team has found mosquito eggs in birdbaths, flowerpot saucers, children’s toys, old tires ― anything that can gather and collect water.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that a good way to prevent mosquito breeding grounds is to ensure standing water is removed, especially after rainstorms.

If you’re being bitten by mosquitoes after yard treatment, it’s likely from new arrivals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are many sources of mosquitoes in an area, and just because an area was treated, does not mean that mosquitoes in a wide area will be eliminated,” Ashbrook said. “In optimal conditions, a mosquito larva can develop to adulthood in about a week. Additionally, some mosquitoes can travel long distances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s part of why insecticides alone cannot eliminate mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to use integrated pest management, which combines a variety of approaches, including proper identification of mosquitoes, monitoring mosquito populations, using different management techniques to achieve optimal mosquito management outcomes and reducing environmental impacts,” Ashbrook added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Bats and birds can significantly reduce mosquito populations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we should support our bats and birds by providing habitat, and they do consume lots of insects, mosquitoes are not the primary target and will not be significantly reduced by them,” Ashbrook said. “Bats are often consuming moth and beetle pests of agricultural concern. The little brown bat is the bat species primarily responsible for consuming mosquitoes, and their populations are in decline due to the pathogenic fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes white nose fungus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that bats and birds are not effective replacements for mosquito control districts or pest management services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myth: Cold winters kill all mosquitoes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

            If you needed another reason to get your daily steps in, science just handed you one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00023j6oy5rjmspn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A new study shows that &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/24/health/walking-full-body-exercise-wellness"&gt;walking daily&lt;/a&gt; can reduce the risk of cognitive decline — especially among those with a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00033j6o56wbk3gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Almost 3,000 participants between the ages of 70 and 79 reported their daily walking habits over the course of 10 years, according to research that will be presented Tuesday at the annual &lt;a href="https://aaic.alz.org/overview.asp" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer’s Association International Conference&lt;/a&gt;. Those who reported maintaining or increasing their walking habits over the years showed greater improvements in processing speed and executive function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00043j6o8jzswg20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The benefits of walking were especially noticeable among those with a genetic predisposition for developing Alzheimer’s disease, according to the preprint, which has not been peer-reviewed or published in a professional journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00053j6oqnxkfta1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know sedentary behavior increases as you get older, and physical activity decreases,” said senior study author Dr. Cindy Barha, an assistant professor of kinesiology at the University of Calgary in Alberta. “So we recommend reducing your sedentary behavior by introducing small bouts of walking in between those times you have to be sitting down.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00073j6oj0qrlo8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/07/health/alzheimers-dementia-ornish-lifestyle-wellness"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; is a severe form of dementia thought to be caused by a buildup of harmful plaques in the brain that interfere with how the nerve cells communicate, eventually leading to their death, Barha said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00083j6o19b74beb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As more nerve cells die, people with Alzheimer’s can develop progressive memory loss, confusion, personality changes and physical decline. Eventually, the disease can be fatal, and there is no known cure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji00093j6oe2xvz34b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Genetics are thought to play a major role in the disease. Specifically, genotypes called APOE affect the metabolism of plaque and other fats throughout the bloodstream. One specific kind, APOE4, is known to make it harder for the brain to clear the plaques and is linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8ji000a3j6oi5yu2y8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 15% to 25% of people have this version of the APOE gene, and the only way to find out is from a genetic test, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet#:~:text=APOE%20%CE%B54%20increases%20risk%20for,to%205%25%20carry%20two%20copies." target="_blank"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the US National Institutes of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmdm8okjn000v3j6owd9vzwd1@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="the-mind-body-connection" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        The mind-body connection
&lt;/h2&gt;

            Although the new study did not test a uniform walking regimen, Barha suggests walking multiple times daily to break up sedentary behavior and maintaining consistent walking habits year to year to prevent cognitive decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000d3j6o7y7cgthn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “More research is really needed to determine how many steps that really takes, but more is definitely going to be better,” she said. “The next steps would be to actually try to figure out the minimum amount of walking for different subgroups, (such as) females versus males, APOE4 carriers versus non-carriers.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000e3j6obiw601kc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/step-dementia-risk-wellness"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; found that even people who walked about 3,800 steps per day at any speed cut their risk of dementia by 25%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000f3j6oapy6jy8s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What might be going on between the brain and the rest of the body? Experts have several theories.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000g3j6od0n57aq9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For one, regular exercise has been shown to help the body produce more of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which is like fertilizer for your brain, helping it grow more cells and form new connections, Barha explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000h3j6o9fam138e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re thinking there’s proteins released from the muscle that travel to the brain and, either across the blood-brain barrier or at the blood-brain barrier, start a reaction that eventually leads to increases in BDNF within the brain,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000i3j6o3mqudc22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another theory is that exercise reduces neuroinflammation, a common symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000j3j6ot4wu7eot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The brain sends immune cells called microglia to attack plaque buildup, but this can backfire, explained Dr. Christiane Wrann, an associate professor of medicine at the Cardiovascular Research Center at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Chronic inflammation can lead microglia to begin attacking healthy brain cells as well, damaging the brain’s connections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000k3j6oig1ocd7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you exercise, you actually strengthen the gene expression program that microglia need to function properly,” Wrann said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000m3j6og7pczdpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers were surprised to find that walking provided the greatest benefit to those with the APOE4 gene compared to those without it. To understand why this is, more research will be needed — but Barha has a theory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000n3j6ou7c2ehtr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Before the study started, we think APOE4 carriers had more room to grow in terms of cognition, since they may already have been experiencing some cognitive decline,” she said. “They also have more room to show improvement.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000o3j6o3ohj2zz2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s possible that the study itself also motivated participants with APOE4 genes to walk more than they had been beforehand, slowing their rate of decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdm8m8jj000p3j6ogfdj711b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is a very strong example (that) it’s never too late to start exercising,” Wrann said. “Every step counts, and it’s much better to do an exercise regimen that you actually like, that you can actually stick to.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For two decades, Washington, D.C., pediatrician &lt;a href="https://appointments.childrensnational.org/provider/olanrewaju-omolayo-falusi/2359516" target="_blank"&gt;Lanre Falusi&lt;/a&gt; has counseled parents about vaccine safety, side effects, and timing. But this year, she said, the conversations have changed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002d3b6nltjw1v2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For the first time, I’m having parents of newborns ask me if their baby will still be able to get vaccines,” Falusi said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002e3b6nhxgzdj6l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Throughout the country, pediatricians say anxious parents are concerned about access to routine childhood immunizations, especially those with children on Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income families and people with disabilities. Medicaid covers 4 in 10 children in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002f3b6nzxtnuic0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really became an issue when RFK Jr. stepped into the role of HHS secretary,” said &lt;a href="https://palmettopediatric.com/downtown-office.php" target="_blank"&gt;Deborah Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in South Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002g3b6nlkzbre0z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concern accelerated after the shake-up of a key Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5428533/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisory-committee-acip" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisory body&lt;/a&gt; in June, raising fears that millions of American families could soon have to pay out-of-pocket for shots now covered by their health insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0y002h3b6ny9cwgp35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, removed all 17 members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the panel responsible for recommending which shots are included in the nation’s adult and childhood immunization schedules.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002i3b6nv24fxm96@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy replaced the panelists with new members aligned with his views, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/" target="_blank"&gt;prompting alarm&lt;/a&gt; among medical professionals and public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002j3b6ni13kizyf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People should be worried about what’s going to happen to the availability of vaccines for children,” said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002n3b6n2qhz7rz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under the Affordable Care Act, health insurers &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/issue-brief/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank"&gt;are required&lt;/a&gt; to cover all ACIP-recommended vaccines. States and other jurisdictions use the childhood vaccine schedule to set immunization requirements for schoolchildren. ACIP’s recommendations also determine which vaccines get covered by the Vaccines for Children Program, a CDC-funded initiative that provides free immunizations to low-income and uninsured children. Half of children in the U.S. are eligible for the VFC program.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002o3b6nur26x8sd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If the new ACIP members withdraw support for a particular vaccine and the CDC director agrees, Tolbert said, the consequences would be immediate. “It would automatically affect what is covered and therefore which vaccines are available to children on Medicaid,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Health insurance companies have not yet said how they would alter coverage, but Tolbert said such a move would open the door for private insurers to refuse to cover the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002q3b6ngymy1ga1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pediatricians worry about a future where parents might have to choose — pay hundreds of dollars out-of-pocket for shots or leave their kids unprotected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002r3b6neeu37hbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/" target="_blank"&gt;health insurance industry group AHIP&lt;/a&gt; said that health plans “continue to follow federal requirements related to coverage of ACIP-recommended vaccines and will continue to support broad access to critical preventive services, including immunizations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002s3b6nunlid0fk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pediatricians say news about President Donald Trump’s new budget law, which is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by about $1 trillion over the next decade, also prompted questions from parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002t3b6nivdzf180@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While parents may be worried about losing their Medicaid, the law doesn’t mention vaccines or change eligibility or benefits for children’s Medicaid, Tolbert said. But less federal funding means states will have to make decisions about who is covered and which services are offered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002u3b6ngtfjmwi8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To raise the revenue needed to pay for Medicaid, states could raise taxes; move money earmarked for other spending, such as education or corrections; or, more likely, reduce Medicaid spending.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002v3b6ne7p3s8jd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And they may do that by cutting eligibility for optional populations or by cutting services that are optional, or by reducing payments to providers in the form of provider rates,” Tolbert said. “It’s unclear how this will play out, and it will likely look different across all states.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002w3b6n26yaf9tt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In May, Kennedy announced in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC is no longer recommending the covid-19 vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women. The move &lt;a href="https://downloads.aap.org/AAP/PDF/FiledSuit.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;prompted a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other physician groups that seeks to freeze Kennedy’s directive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002x3b6n7q5c7k3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In June, the new ACIP members appointed by Kennedy voted to recommend that adults and children no longer receive flu vaccines with thimerosal, a preservative rarely used in some flu vaccines. Anti-vaccine activists, including Kennedy, have &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/what-is-thimerosal-what-the-research-says-about-the-vaccine-preservative-under-fire-by-rfk-jr" target="_blank"&gt;rallied against thimerosal&lt;/a&gt; for decades, alleging links to autism despite no evidence of any association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002y3b6n5koy05t4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is no cause for concern,” Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in a statement. “As Secretary Kennedy has stated, no one will be denied access to a licensed vaccine if they choose to receive one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z002z3b6nrb50i5v9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When the ACIP committee met last month, they reaffirmed that flu vaccines will remain accessible and covered, and they emphasized safety by ensuring these vaccines are mercury-free,” Hilliard wrote. “The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program continues to provide COVID-19 vaccines at no cost for eligible children when the parent, provider, and patient decide vaccination is appropriate. Medicaid will continue to reimburse the administration fee.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00303b6nt5158eyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the possibility that a vaccine could be restricted or no longer covered by insurance is already changing how parents approach immunization. In Falusi’s practice, parents are scheduling appointments to coincide precisely with their child’s eligibility, sometimes making appointments the same week as their birthdays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00313b6nxuwdnsmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://journey-pediatrics.com/our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journey-pediatrics.com/our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Melissa Mason&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has evaluated some patients who contracted measles during the multistate outbreak that started in neighboring Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00323b6npss52qdr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s concerned that any new limitations on access or reimbursement for childhood vaccines could lead to even more preventable illnesses and deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00333b6ntskcj6b8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nationally, there have been more than 1,300 measles cases since January, including three deaths, according to the CDC. “We’re seeing this outbreak because vaccination rates are too low and it allows measles to spread in the community,” Mason said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00343b6ng0svx4wa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children and teens account for 66% of national measles cases. Mason has begun offering the measles vaccine to infants as young as 6 months old, a full six months earlier than standard practice, though still within federal guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00353b6nv8bcsbi1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, overall kindergarten&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" target="_blank"&gt;vaccination rates fell&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. At the same time, the number of children with a school vaccination exemption continued to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00363b6nljubxu00@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pertussis, or whooping cough — another disease that can be deadly to young children — is spreading. &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/182774" target="_blank"&gt;As of July 5&lt;/a&gt;, more than 15,100 cases had been identified in U.S. residents this year, according to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00373b6nbf8ncohz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mason said pertussis is especially dangerous to babies too young to receive the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00383b6nw0xbvs1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For now, pediatricians are trying to maintain a sense of urgency without inciting panic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z00393b6nrhuzytyk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Columbia, South Carolina, Greenhouse used to offer families a flexible age range for routine vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003a3b6nsn3y5lbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m not saying that anymore,” the pediatrician said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003b3b6n2v1zwybg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She now urges parents to get their children vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003c3b6neie8f6yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She described anxious parents asking whether the HPV vaccine, which helps &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/what-i-tell-every-patient-about-the-hpv-vaccine" target="_blank"&gt;prevent cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, can be administered to children younger than the recommended age of 9.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003d3b6nz6esnh2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I actually had two parents today ask if their 7- or 8-year-olds could get the HPV shot,” Greenhouse said. “I had to tell them it’s not allowed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003e3b6nttavj3ru@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With the vaccine requiring multiple doses months apart, Greenhouse fears time may run out for families to get the series covered by insurance. If they have to pay out-of-pocket, she’s afraid some families may choose not to get the second dose. A second dose could cost &lt;a href="https://www.gardasil9.com/patient-a/cost/" target="_blank"&gt;about $300&lt;/a&gt; if no longer covered by insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003f3b6nmt8xu05o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I cannot be 100% sure what the future looks like for some of these vaccines,” Greenhouse said. “I can tell you it’s a very scary place to be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmdjceg0z003g3b6ndc59iljn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s newly appointed vaccine advisory committee is expected to hold its next &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;public meeting&lt;/a&gt; as soon as August.

Physical activity lowers inflammation in the body. Evidence has shown that both aerobic and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/strength-training-gym-workout/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training forms of exercise&lt;/a&gt; are important. But only 1 in 4 Americans meet the two activity guidelines from the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-infographic" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;: aerobic exercise of 150 minutes per week of at least moderate physical activity, such as walking, bicycling on level ground, dancing or gardening, and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/29/weight-lifting-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; for at least &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/strength-and-resistance-training-exercise#:~:text=The%20American%20Heart%20Association%20recommends,protect%20your%20body%20from%20injury." target="_blank"&gt;two sessions&lt;/a&gt; per week, which typically translates to 60 minutes weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NCWIVNQFG5GBPLYBKMWS2NBPPA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The protective benefit of exercise is seen with even relatively low levels of activity, such as around &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/18/1975/7226309" target="_blank"&gt;2,500 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; (via sustained physical activity, not starting and stopping), and generally increases proportionately with more activity.

Two out of three people with obesity have this syndrome, which is defined as having three out of five features: high fasting blood glucose, high fasting triglycerides, high blood pressure, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and central adiposity (waist circumference of more than 40 inches in men, 35 inches in women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FPQOFUC3PFHVRPHICZJ5J6EUMA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Metabolic syndrome is also present in a high proportion of people without obesity, about 50 million Americans. Prediabetes often overlaps with it. Prediabetes is defined as a hemoglobin A1c (a measure of how much glucose is stuck to your red blood cells) between 5.7 and 6.4 percent, or a fasting glucose between 100 and 125 milligrams per deciliter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2GDROICPCZGQXN6YE3CSKRX3SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both metabolic syndrome and prediabetes carry an increased risk of heart disease and can be prevented — and countered — by weight loss, exercise and an optimal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AKK4Z26XZEDZAYB2Y45LCD4HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As the glucagon-like peptide drug family moves to pills and less expense in the future, these medications may prove helpful for reducing risk in people with metabolic syndrome and prediabetes.

The optimal blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg or lower. But with aging, there is often an elevation of systolic blood pressure to about 130 mm Hg, related to stiffening of arteries. While common, it is still considered elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBS4Z3NB4RB7ZOEMFQOP6VF7UE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ideally, everyone should monitor their blood pressure with a home device to make sure they haven’t developed hypertension.

The term polygenic refers to hundreds of DNA variants in the genome that are linked to risk of heart disease. This is very different from a family history, because we’re a product of both our mother’s and father’s genomes, and the way the DNA variants come together in each of us can vary considerably for combinations of variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YLR4N7RSHZBSRNDZI2RFUHE4NY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That means you could have high or low risk for heart disease that is different from your familial pattern. People with a high polygenic risk score benefit the most from medications to lower cholesterol, such as statins. A polygenic risk score can be obtained from a number of commercial companies, though it isn’t typically covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N55MTVM6UNGAHJ5NHUBIC3OWK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I don’t recommend getting a calcium score of your coronary arteries via a computed tomography (CT) scan. This test is overused and often induces overwhelming anxiety in patients with a high calcium score but without symptoms or bona fide risk. If you have symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease, such as chest discomfort with exercise, then a CT angiogram may be helpful to map the coronary arteries. It is much more informative than a calcium score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6MQLJBMKUJE75AESQOP5GFJCQU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6MQLJBMKUJE75AESQOP5GFJCQU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;7.

While lifestyle improvements can help, significant elevation typically requires medications such as a statin; ezetimibe; bempedoic acid; or injectables such as evolocumab (Repatha), alirocumab (Praluent) or inclisiran (Leqvio). The higher the risk, the more aggressive LDL lowering may be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="34SN3RVQYVDJTG2MN6I7B2FTBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It should be noted that the use of potent statins, such as rosuvastatin or atorvastatin, especially at high doses, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(24)00040-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;is linked&lt;/a&gt; to inducing glucose intolerance and risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Recent small studies have provided evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2475306-drugs-like-ozempic-and-wegovy-could-significantly-cut-dementia-risk/#:~:text=Although%20the%20exact%20mechanism%20is,in%20the%20brain%2C%20says%20Reddin."&gt;GLP-1s may stave off dementia&lt;/a&gt; and Alzheimer’s disease, reduce &lt;a href="https://umcgresearch.org/w/diabetes-drug-ozempic-also-has-positive-effect-in-chronic-kidney-damage"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/how-do-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-affect-liver"&gt;liver problems&lt;/a&gt;, and may even be able to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2829811"&gt;treat alcohol and drug dependence&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other compulsive behaviors like &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/14/glp1-drugs-addiction-treatment-rehab-center-uses-weight-loss-drugs-to-reduce-cravings/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Fl7S0GEjfoKOAY89a_sDZYKQ3yJQEKMIGTSdpEu1XvNdJfES7d9t3Sehz3HXzigjyy0IXy-0YFCyIgZTlP_5TWXHajg&amp;amp;_hsmi=371103413&amp;amp;utm_content=371103413&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;sex, gambling and shopping addiction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With each additional study finding yet another application for these drugs, you might find yourself asking: Should &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; be taking Ozempic? Should &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; take it? Is there anything these drugs can’t do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And indeed, right now it can seem like everyone will be taking GLP-1, sooner or later. These drugs currently require regular injections and can cost more than $1,000 out of pocket, but cheaper and more easily used versions are coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Eli Lilly will soon bring a &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eli-lilly-glp-1-pill-trial-fda-approval/#:~:text=Eli%20Lilly%20and%20Co.%2C%20the,3%20trial%2C%20the%20company%20said."&gt;pill version to the market&lt;/a&gt;, with a version expected to debut at a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/health/weight-loss-pill-eli-lilly.html#:~:text=How%20much%20will%20the%20drug,instead%20of%20going%20through%20insurance."&gt;lower price than injectable Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; or Wegovy did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/novo-nordisk-s-canadian-mistake"&gt;generic GLP-1 agonist&lt;/a&gt; is on track to arrive at Canadian pharmacies in 2026 and a US version will likely follow within the next decade. Some of the newer versions in development &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/21/well/new-weight-loss-drugs.html"&gt;may prove to be even more effective&lt;/a&gt; than the first generation, which will only create more demand among doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Put it all together, and we can expect many, many more people taking them. GLP-1 drug prescriptions for adults with &lt;a href="https://www.fairhealth.org/article/white-paper-on-obesity-and-glp-1-drugs-released-by-fair-health"&gt;commercial insurance increased&lt;/a&gt; by a staggering 364 percent from 2019 to 2024, but they were still only prescribed to 4 percent of insured US adults; more than 100 million US adults — &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/glp-1-drugs-health-benefits-4014d7d5"&gt;40 percent of the population — are obese&lt;/a&gt;, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year, and as more insurers cover these drugs for weight loss, more patients will be able to access them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These drugs’ power comes from their mysterious ability to control people’s compulsions. Patients who take an GLP-1 agonist say that the fatty ultraprocessed foods they used to find irresistible are no longer so tempting, though sometimes those &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1e7rgru/return_of_the_cravings/"&gt;old cravings for unhealthy junk&lt;/a&gt; come rushing back after taking the drugs for a while. Substances as habit-forming as coffee no longer hold the same sway. Others notice decreased desires that have nothing to do with their diet — to bite their nails, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;We are entering the Ozempic era, and even as excitement grows about the possibilities for these medications, now is the time to take seriously the possible risks from this new class of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A lot of people experience brand-new cravings, sometimes for healthier foods. “Beans — I get cravings for beans. I never really ate them before, now I crave homemade baked beans in a tomato sauce,” Sarah, a charity development worker from Scotland who has been taking a GLP-1 compound for a few months, told me by email. “It used to bother me if a cafe served beans on a cooked breakfast; now beans is the main part of my breakfast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Swapping salad greens for carbs sound like a clear win — in fact, it sounds almost too good to be true. In the long term, what does it mean to modulate our desire? Are we sure we can suppress the harmful compulsion to eat too much without compromising the productive ones — such as the desire to succeed or the pleasure we find in personal relationships? How might these drugs impact our experience of joy and pain? What might that do to impact the messy human experience of…simply living?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“What are the very long-term effects of these drugs? The literature will say, ‘Well, there isn’t really bad long-term effects because some people have been taking it for diabetes for 10 years, and they don’t have bad effects,’” &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/berridge.html"&gt;Kent Berridge&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Michigan, told me. “And I think that’s a fair argument. But then 10 years is not 20 years or 30 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We are entering the Ozempic era, and even as excitement grows about the possibilities for these medications, now is the time to take seriously the possible risks from this new class of drugs. In my conversations with some of the top experts on the science of cravings, they offered a cautious outlook in regard to messing with our brain’s desire pathways. But they were also optimistic that these drugs could deliver benefits to many Americans without turning us into emotionless robots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-glp-1s-work-for-so-many-different-medical-conditions" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why GLP-1s work for so many different medical conditions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the 1980s, scientists had identified the naturally occurring hormone GLP-1 and its importance in regulating people’s digestion. By the end of the decade, investigators had confirmed that the hormone &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01931-z"&gt;encouraged insulin production&lt;/a&gt; — offering the potential to treat people with diabetes, who struggle to produce insulin that regulates their blood sugar. Then just a few years later, a scientist identified a peptide &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-literally-came-from-a-monster-and-its-not-alone"&gt;from the Gila monster&lt;/a&gt; that was similar to the human hormone GLP-1 but came in a more stable form, offering therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By the mid-2000s, the first GLP-1 agonist drugs were approved for diabetes, but the daily injections required and the narrow focus kept the market small. In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved Ozempic — a weekly injection, rather than a daily shot. &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/47/11/1873/156807/Efficacy-and-Safety-of-GLP-1-Medicines-for-Type-2"&gt;By that point&lt;/a&gt;, doctors had already begun to notice that some patients who took the GLP-1 agonists experienced a reduced appetite with resulting weight loss. Researchers began to study the weight-loss effects and they were stunned: One of the first studies found users &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183"&gt;lost 15 percent of their body weight&lt;/a&gt;, on average, in little more than a year, a wildly larger percentage than from any other weight loss drug or tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The Ozempic &lt;a href="/culture/24001338/ozempic-bodies-barbie-botox-corporate-feminism"&gt;fervor&lt;/a&gt; had begun. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/compounded-and-counterfeit-semaglutide"&gt;Specialty pharmacies started to sell off-brand&lt;/a&gt; compounded versions of the drugs. The FDA then approved Wegovy, an Ozempic successor, for weight loss in 2021, and in 2023, Zepbound got the green light for weight-loss prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As their astonishing weight-loss effects became clear, research into GLP-1 agonists and their health benefits exploded. Today, the list of possible benefits is genuinely astounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But how, exactly, do they work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, a drug like Ozempic mimics the natural GLP-1 hormone in your gut, which slows down digestion in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Those who take it feel fuller earlier and longer, and it’s easier for them to eat less. The better regulation of blood sugar also prevents massive swings in glucose, which can induce hunger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a result of its effect on digestion, the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-ozempic-constipation#causes"&gt;most common clinical side effects reported with Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and its peers are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and constipation. In clinical trials for GLP-1 treatment for diabetes or obesity, between 4 and 12 percent of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9821052/"&gt;patients experienced constipation&lt;/a&gt;; a similar share of patients endured vomiting and diarrhea. There have been reports of other rare but serious physical side effects: The drugs have been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/05/glp-1-drugs-low-but-elevated-risk-of-age-related-macular-degeneration/"&gt;linked to an elevated risk of eye disease&lt;/a&gt; among older patients, for example. Some people who lose weight quickly &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/ozempic/does-ozempic-cause-hair-loss?srsltid=AfmBOoo4EALBX7q2Bf4FtWyTzsEm-HGntr3whxiWCeHrbKESV-MC55tq"&gt;experience temporary hair loss&lt;/a&gt;, a symptom that a small number of patients on GLP-1 medications have anecdotally reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But scientists have also discovered these drugs can affect your brain directly, with sometimes surprising and unpredictable effects on people’s cravings — for food and for other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Naturally occurring GLP-1 secretes from in a person’s intestines into their blood and it disappears within a matter of minutes, destroyed by enzymes in the blood, Berridge said. As a result, it does not cross into people’s brains very easily. The drug form, GLP-1 agonists, on the other hand, &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;cross this barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When a person takes Ozempic or Wegovey or whichever GLP-1 they’ve been prescribed, the semaglutide endures for a long time, giving it more time to cross into the brain. Once the chemical is in that person’s brain, it can turbocharge neurons in your brainstem that naturally produce some very small amounts of GLP-1. Those neurons then release the hormone into many other parts of the brain and disrupt the release of dopamine, which produces that little surge of pleasure that makes eating a sweet sugary piece of cake so damn good or finishing a half marathon after months of training so satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The drugs are getting into these structures and it turns out that they suppress cravings in all of these places, including the reward-system ones,” Berridge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Scientists began to make this connection when observational studies reported that people who took a GLP-1 agonist for its diabetes or weight-loss effects also reported &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2827069"&gt;consuming less alcohol or fewer illicit drugs&lt;/a&gt; than they did before. Researchers started to probe further, experimenting with injecting microdoses of a semaglutide directly into the brains of animals in lab studies, and they have found a decrease in all kinds of cravings, including powerful compulsions for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924977X25001300"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361923022002210"&gt;heroin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These findings have introduced the startling possibility that, beyond food, we could control some of the most uncontrollable urges that people struggle with, often to the detriment of their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But they also bring us to the big question: If we can turn down the volume of our desire, how might that change the very emotions that make us human, the experience of our deepest joys and pleasures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-the-science-on-desire-can-tell-us-about-glp-1s" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What the science on desire can tell us about GLP-1s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I’ve started to think of the dilemma these drugs present this way: Can I cut off the part of my brain that compels me to reach for a bag of potato chips at night, without compromising the desire to sit down and read books with my children?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Unfortunately, we simply don’t know yet. Scientists aren’t exactly sure how these complex human desires interact. The desire to eat, for example, is one of our oldest evolutionary impulses, Berridge, the Michigan neuroscientist, told me. Can we really mess with that ancient part of our brain without unintended consequences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are at least two ways of thinking about what the answer might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, the (maybe) good news: Berridge’s research has focused on the distinction between &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; something and &lt;em&gt;liking&lt;/em&gt; it. He told me if Ozempic can eliminate our unchecked wanting of something that’s bad for us — such as fatty, processed foods or alcohol, for example — but still maintain our enjoyment of it, that would suggest people who take it are not suddenly at risk of losing &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;of the pleasure in their lives, including other things that also cause a surge of dopamine in our brains, like finishing a creative writing project after months of work or cherishing conversations with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is a concept that my former colleague &lt;a href="/science/24086968/glp-1-ozempic-semaglutide-craving-desire-science-wanting-liking-opioids-alcohol"&gt;Brian Resnick explored&lt;/a&gt; last year: GLP-1s have the ability to manipulate a figurative “dial of desire” in our brains, which could be leveraged for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the 1980s, Berridge worked on a series of experiments with a colleague, Terry Robinson, in which they &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1989-21685-001"&gt;eliminated dopamine in rats&lt;/a&gt;. What they observed was the rats stopped voluntarily eating, drinking, and seeking other rewards set up by the investigators. However, when they were given something sweet to eat, their faces would react positively to the taste, just as they normally would. That reactivity, the researchers postured, was a proxy for their joy. The rats could also still become averse to new sensations, which again affirmed a capacity for strong emotions, even if their compulsiveness had been removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Berridge told me he actually doubted their findings at first — how could you like something but not want it? — but it continued to be replicated in experiments by other investigators over the years. In one particularly revealing experiment from 2005, participants were &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0735-7044.119.6.1619"&gt;given cocaine and a dopamine-blocking drug&lt;/a&gt;. They still liked the cocaine when they were given it, but their desire for additional cocaine was dampened when the dopamine was blocked. The study was small, but it affirmed Berridge and Robinson’s initial insight: Dopamine appears to influence the wanting of things, rather than the liking of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-ozempic-and-wegovy-might-change-your-favorite-food/"&gt;Early studies of Ozempic patients&lt;/a&gt; indicate most participants still enjoy their food despite their compulsion to eat being reduced. Some of them, including some of the patients I spoke with, also found themselves desiring healthier foods. “That’s encouraging,” Berridge told me. “I would say that’s a good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;However, another way of understanding desire would raise more cause for concern. &lt;a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/jackie-andrade"&gt;Jackie Andrade&lt;/a&gt;, a psychology professor at the University of Plymouth, has worked with colleagues on the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25306214/#:~:text=Abstract,;%20Craving;%20Desire;%20Imagery."&gt;Elaborated Intrusion Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which proposes that all our cravings are not unique brain processes but part of our general motivation. According to this theory, when we encounter certain “triggers” — such as a physical sensation or some environmental cue — the trigger leads to a burst of spontaneous thoughts about an object of our desires. And when we begin mentally picturing our desire, our craving for it only increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here is the key finding, Andrade told me: The object of desire — whether it be alcohol, chocolate, or cigarettes — is less important than the underlying mental processes involved in craving. The brain mechanisms are the same regardless of the craving, based on their observations of people’s brain patterns when being presented with different triggers. We crave something because the image of it in our minds is briefly pleasurable and thinking about whatever it is boosts our mood, which in turn strengthens the craving and our awareness that we don’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This explains one of the conundrums about desire: Our desires are thoughts and thoughts require mental effort. So why aren’t they easier to shake? This cycle of environmental triggers — seeing a billboard advertising fast food or attending a cookout with chips and dip on display — leads to our imagining the craving, which leads to both pleasure if we satisfy it and frustration if we don’t, which is why we feel such strong impulses to resolve the cravings. But, at least according to the Plymouth researchers’ work, there is not a clear distinction between a craving for a piece of pizza and a craving for something more productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“From our research, the cognitive processes are the same for both,” Andrade said. “Could we have less driven entrepreneurs or marathon runners because they’re on these drugs and they’re too chilled out to want to do anything? Right now, we don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-we-still-need-to-figure-out-about-these-drugs" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What we still need to figure out about these drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even as their usage explodes, the reality behind these drugs and how they affect our desires is still a mystery. Pills are likely to have the same effect as injections on cravings, Berridge told me, so long as the GLP-1 agonist is still crossing into people’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“In what sense is it reducing wanting? Because there’s a couple of possible ways. One way would be to subtract a degree of intensity from every want,” Berridge said. “So addictive wants go down, but then so do the everyday desires in life and even eagerness to go out into the world and face it and do things. That would be bad if it was a general subtraction in intensity of wanting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“On the other hand, it is possible that that’s not what it’s doing, but rather it’s lowering the ceiling,” he continued. “So really intense peaks of wanting can’t go so high, but things below that ceiling can still remain normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In other words, GLP-1 agonists can only decrease the intense peaks of our cravings, which could allow us to, for example, not binge-eat or overdrink — without eliminating a more normal intensity of wanting for other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem is, Berridge said: “I don’t know of any actual studies that have asked this question.” He said he would like to see a study that measures people’s motivation to pursue a wide range of incentives, both mild and intense ones, when on and off one of these drugs. Researchers at the University of Plymouth are setting up studies that would evaluate behavioral changes in people who take the GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We need more evidence, because what we have right now is circumstantial and inconclusive anecdotes. Peruse the many Reddit communities devoted to these weight-loss drugs and you’ll see the subject of cravings come up a lot. Some people &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1kiygzq/food_cravings_are_back_even_when_i_am_not_hungry/"&gt;describe food cravings&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mounjaro/comments/1e7rgru/return_of_the_cravings/"&gt;come back&lt;/a&gt; after a few months of taking Ozempic or Wegovy. Others report strange new cravings they never experienced before, such as a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1f955gu/weird_craving_on_ozempic/"&gt;sudden taste for milk&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the changes are expected — decreased desire for nicotine or alcohol — but some are puzzling: One user, a true crime aficionado, described a reduced desire to look at dark or gory materials online &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/weird_elimination_of_cravingsurges/"&gt;after being on a GLP-1 agonist&lt;/a&gt;. Others responded by sharing that they were &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/comment/i9v0yah/"&gt;less compelled to shop online&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/comment/i9vijrh/"&gt;stopped biting&lt;/a&gt; their nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Sarah, the charity development worker from Scotland, told me she started taking a GLP-1 drug three months ago after she gained weight during perimenopause and was struggling to lose it. She’s since lost 18 pounds. There have been some physical side effects — fatigue and acid reflux — and she’s noticed a significant shift in her cravings. Whereas she used to mix salads with pasta, she finds she no longer craves the carbs. Mashed potatoes used to be one of her favorite foods, but she hasn’t eaten that once since going on the medication. At the same time, she has new hankerings for beans and green apples — which she told me she found puzzling because she says she used to hate the sound of teeth crunching into an apple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I don’t get the same emotions from food,” she told me over email. “It’s nice, I enjoy it, but I don’t &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; food in the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;She, like many other patients, also says she no longer experiences the same desire to drink alcohol. She told me she drinks at most one night on the weekend and no longer attends happy hours with her colleagues like she used to, when she would have a few drinks midweek. “I don’t go and not drink, I just don’t go,” she told me. “Drunk people are tedious when you’re sober!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;GLP-1s are genuinely promising, but they also reveal our insatiable desire to find a wonder drug that takes care of all of our problems in one pill. Andrade said we should resist that temptation, even if Ozempic and its peers could play a role in helping to address important health crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Research has consistently found that &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa050156#:~:text=At%20one%20year%2C%20subjects%20who,in%20lieu%20of%2C%20lifestyle%20modification."&gt;weight loss tends to be more sustainable&lt;/a&gt; when it includes behavioral changes in addition to pharmaceutical interventions. Ideally, you would do both: work on modifying your behavior, while medication assists. Losing weight isn’t just about eating less, but eating healthier and exercising more in order to enjoy the health benefits that those positive activities produce. If Ozempic affects all kinds of motivation, patients may not be as driven to adopt those other desirable behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If people are taking these drugs, are they more motivated to, say, become more physically active or to eat more healthily? Or are they less motivated because the drugs are doing it for them?” Andrade said. “There’s the risk that people might not want to make changes. If you’ve still got a bad diet and a sedentary lifestyle, you’re building up other problems that are maybe a little bit more hidden because the obesity is not there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is already an ongoing subject of concern: Some studies have suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ozempic-rebound"&gt;people who stop taking Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; gain back much of the weight they lost; that may be because they are not adopting desirable new behaviors — better eating, more activity — alongside their taking the drug. On the flip side, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/glp-1-drugs-health-benefits-4014d7d5"&gt;some doctors say they also worry&lt;/a&gt; about people who take the drugs for reasons other than weight loss but end up undereating and increasing the related health risks of undernourishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Are these findings a canary in the coal mine for other unexpected and undesirable side effects related to the drug’s effects on cravings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s a genuinely vexing question. After all, many people take these drugs because they do have a problematic compulsive behavior — they eat too much. Getting those cravings under control is the point of getting a prescription. But are people also losing other less obvious desires? Are they losing, in a sense, a part of themselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The evidence for now is mixed. One Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/comment/i9xo5uw/"&gt;joked&lt;/a&gt; they felt like they were getting mental health care they didn’t know they needed. Two Reddit users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/uwx40b/comment/i9vlg0b/"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; that they had cut down from multiple cups of coffee in the morning to one (or less). “I’m kind of bummed about it,” one said. “I love my coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Same. I love coffee,” the other poster replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But Sarah in Scotland told me that while she is grateful to have a less emotional relationship with food, she’s aware of something else lurking below the surface. “I sort of miss the feeling I got from a big carb binge. It was sort of — anaesthetising maybe?” she said. “I’ve had some really powerful emotions recently and I wonder if they’re exacerbated (by) not being able to use food to push them down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOXzF3c1FXcUFLNFh4OFZEYUZzTW81ZmFCRGt3Wk1HQktrRkNDMHpMV3BQQlVZWDc2RkttMlNFbTFBaGc5azd5bUJqWWt6bWdaTnNEYnU4U2d1aDBVSnR6bEplaWFtakhBd081SVJvZjY2Z1oxeUUzT1NlM1JrZWJON1RjYVJnQQ</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情在加利福尼亚州今年夏天会有多糟糕？ -《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQLTBiN0VCX19JdzE3WWNaSVNtSnpBWTg1clcyWWVaZDVyYkdfMk1pcWt5R09xSmFVLVo0dkwzVWUzYTZUM01VU0FGZ3lrUW16TnBobERkekhzdEM4b2h1LWtTbHlTX1FyR3VGU1Z5THRjekExMTU0N0R0bW9Ha0FzMHdxQWJjLVB1d192SEJ1UDctanMwa3haUHFhNVl3dDhhLXJBSW5WOWZZdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cmsFontBrandText font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 is once again on the rise in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether this latest uptick foreshadows the sort of misery seen last year — when the state was walloped by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-05/californias-covid-surge-is-robust-and-long-lasting-surpassing-peak-from-summer-of-2022"&gt;its worst summertime surge&lt;/a&gt; since 2022 — or proves fleeting. But officials and experts say it’s nevertheless a reminder of the seasonal potency of the still-circulating virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely are seeing an uptick in the summer,” Dr. Erica Pan, director of the California Department of Public Health and the state health officer, said during a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/FzZPYPRh7CE?si=LqeH9PciU6f4c-Nm&amp;amp;t=117" target="_blank"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has often been the case with COVID, the latest increase in infections is not playing out uniformly across the state. The uptick was first registered in Northern California and only started being seen in Southern California more recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Hudson, regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California, said she expects an uptick in cases in the Southland over the next two to three weeks, based on the level of coronavirus being detected in wastewater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My colleagues at Northern California Kaiser Permanente have already noticed this trend, so I suspect it will be coming to Los Angeles soon,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, COVID activity remains well below the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-12/why-is-covid-still-surging-in-california-a-midsummer-mutation-may-be-to-blame"&gt;level seen last summer&lt;/a&gt; at this point — and it’s too soon to say how bad this season will be. While last summer saw a particularly potent spike in infections, this past winter was the mildest of the COVID era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll know over the next couple of weeks which direction things are going,” Hudson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains possible that COVID could end up being as active as last year, if not worse, according to Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UC San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a longer time since a lot of people got infected,” Chin-Hong said, noting California’s last busy COVID season was about a year ago, and immunity has waned since then. “And just like last year, there are new variants afoot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said he’s been hearing more people ask for advice about COVID recently. Doctors suggest taking common-sense steps to avoid getting sick, such as avoiding people who are ill, and getting up-to-date vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because you had an easy case the last time doesn’t mean that you’ll have an easy case this time,” Chin-Hong said. “A lot of people I’ve talked to who’ve gotten COVID this year, it was a pretty vicious case that lasted a long time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the part of the country with the highest coronavirus wastewater activity level at the moment is the West. On the state level, the CDC says California has “moderate” coronavirus activity level in its sewage, as does Nevada, Texas, Mississippi, Kentucky and South Carolina. Florida has “high” activity and Louisiana, “very high” activity, federal data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viral levels in wastewater have still been rising in many parts of the country, Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A possible silver lining is that Chin-Hong expects the rate of infected people who need hospitalization will continue to drop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of early July, the rate at which lab tests were coming back positive for coronavirus infection in California was 5.5%. That’s higher than at any point since last winter, but still relatively low, Pan said. On Thursday, the California Department of Public Health said viral levels in wastewater are 66% lower than they were at this time last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point last year, the COVID test positivity rate was 8.2%, and peaked at around 12% in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels are considered high in the sewershed of San Jose and Palo Alto, according to the Santa Clara County Public Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing an increase in COVID transmission in some parts of the county over the past several weeks,” the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, coronavirus wastewater levels have also been rising — but remain lower than last summer’s surge, according to the local Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles County, the rate at which coronavirus tests are coming back positive is rising. For the week ending July 12, the most recent for which complete data are available, 6.4% of specimens tested by labs were positive, up from 4.8% the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in L.A. County wastewater have been roughly flat in recent weeks, and are lower than the levels seen the past few summers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the data suggest a slight increase in COVID-19 activity in L.A. County, but nothing yet consistent with a significant summer ‘surge,’” the local Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is much the same in Orange County, where the COVID test positivity rate is at 6.3% and increasing, but “still below recent years for this time of the year,” according to Dr. Christopher Zimmerman, deputy medical director of the Orange County Health Care Agency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-related visits to the emergency room in Orange County remain stable, accounting for 1.1% of all ER visits, compared  with around 4% in August 2024, Zimmerman said. COVID-related admissions remain flat, comprising only 0.6% of hospitalized patients in the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That metric hasn’t exceeded 1% since the winter, and is down from the 1.8% recorded at this time last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health’s medium-term forecast predicts a minor summer COVID wave that is expected to peak in late August, Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State scientists do expect that California will see either a stronger summer COVID wave or a more significant winter wave. They do not expect the state will see the one-two punch of seasonal surges that were typical during &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-31/l-a-county-ends-covid-19-emergency"&gt;the COVID emergency era&lt;/a&gt;, Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most dominant circulating subvariant now is NB.1.8.1, which has been dubbed “Nimbus.” But the fastest-growing strain nationwide is XFG, nicknamed after another type of cloud, “Stratus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are highly contagious, officials say — and Nimbus has been particularly associated with what patients describe as “razor blade throat,” feeling like their throats are studded with razor blades. However, current available vaccines are expected to cover these subvariants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Covid19Vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;recommends that &lt;/a&gt;everyone age 6 months and up “should have access and the choice to receive currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines, with an emphasis on protecting higher-risk individuals, such as infants and toddlers, pregnant individuals and others with risks for serious disease,” Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s stronger than the latest federal guidance, which reflects recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-31/cdc-radically-changes-its-covid-vaccine-recommendations-heres-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; issued by the Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration dropped the recommendation that healthy children and healthy pregnant women be vaccinated for COVID-19. In formal documents, health officials offer “no guidance” as to whether pregnant women should get the vaccine, and ask that parents talk with a healthcare provider before getting the vaccine for their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year, the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another COVID shot despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children,”  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;social media video&lt;/a&gt; announcing the changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has denigrated vaccines over the years, did not elaborate on the rationale for altering the recommendation for pregnant women in the 58-second video. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pan said there were some contradictions in the latest federal guidance, given that the Trump administration was recommending the COVID-19 vaccine for people at serious risk of severe illness — a group that includes pregnant women — “but then it was stated the COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of health groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and American Public Health Assn., have &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32580/AAP-suing-HHS-over-vaccine-policy-because-we?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy in federal court, &lt;a class="link" href="https://apnews.com/article/lawsuit-vaccines-kennedy-95a1aa23c3f015f7a35a570f5ef8da36" target="_blank"&gt;alleging&lt;/a&gt; he violated federal law by changing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations without scientific evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In California, an estimated 37% of seniors have received at least one dose of the latest version of the COVID-19 vaccine, which was released in September. The rate is around 50% for much of the San Francisco Bay Area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior vaccine coverage is roughly 40% in San Diego, Ventura, Santa Barbara and Sacramento counties, and around 30% in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insurance coverage for COVID-19 vaccines is still in place,” Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of medical professional and scientific organizations are aligning to support scientific-based vaccine recommendations, Pan said, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Assn. and AHIP, an association of health insurance plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarmed at the Trump administration’s changes around vaccine policy, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota has launched a “vaccine integrity project,” which aims “to make recommendations for how vaccine use can remain grounded in the best available science, free from external influence,” according to a university &lt;a class="link" href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/cidrap-launches-vaccine-integrity-project" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California health officials are also warning that the proposed federal budget threatens to cut deep into public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government is proposing to halve the budget for the CDC, Pan said  this month, from $9.2 billion to $4.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 80% of the CDC’s funding goes to state and local health agencies, Pan said. Nearly half of the budget for the California Department of Public Health comes from the federal government, and about two-thirds of the state’s public health department budget is given to local health agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed federal budget would eliminate key centers and programs, such as the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, as well as grants for hospital preparedness and preventive health and health services, Pan said. The proposal also suggests reducing by more than half funding for public health emergency preparedness, from $735 million to $350 million, Pan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, a COVID-19 immunization grant was not extended to California and expired, according to the state Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These federal funding cuts mean everyone in Los Angeles County will be at increased risk for transmitting and contracting infectious diseases,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency said it not only works to prevent and control infectious diseases, but also inspects more than 57,000 food facilities and restaurants, tests and issues alerts about beach water quality, looks over safety issues at healthcare facilities and responds to public health emergencies, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-10/six-months-after-the-palisades-and-eaton-fires"&gt;region’s recent wildfires&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The President’s proposed budget ... would continue a dismantling of core public health activities and severely reduce funding for federal public health grant programs, including a 55% cut to the CDC, our main source of federal grant funds,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L.A. County could lose more than $200 million in annual public health funding under the budget proposal, the agency added, which would eliminate or significantly cut funding for public health emergency preparedness, chronic disease prevention, vaccination efforts and worker safety programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the concerns is the sudden termination of more than $45 million in previously awarded federal grant funds that support infectious disease control efforts and lab capacity, vaccination campaigns and substance use prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal court has temporarily paused the Trump administration’s efforts to claw back those federal funds, the county said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But if we do not win this case, that funding will be abruptly terminated, leading to layoffs of dozens of contract employees, terminated purchase orders, and reductions in funding for [community-based organizations] supported by these funds,” the county said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQLTBiN0VCX19JdzE3WWNaSVNtSnpBWTg1clcyWWVaZDVyYkdfMk1pcWt5R09xSmFVLVo0dkwzVWUzYTZUM01VU0FGZ3lrUW16TnBobERkekhzdEM4b2h1LWtTbHlTX1FyR3VGU1Z5THRjekExMTU0N0R0bW9Ha0FzMHdxQWJjLVB1d192SEJ1UDctanMwa3haUHFhNVl3dDhhLXJBSW5WOWZZdw</guid></item><item><title>今天的70岁老年人患痴呆症的可能性低于前几代人–这就是原因吗？ -英国赫芬顿邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in their seventies are less likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/dementia/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="dementia" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="688739ace4b0d2f59325db51" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/dementia/" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; compared to someone of the same age decades ago, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834750?guestAccessKey=bacb167c-2948-4d8a-a4b4-4f6200aa35d6" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a study has found.

                Today's food environment is saturated with ultra-processed food that is particularly harmful to some children.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Back when &lt;a href="https://ph.ucsd.edu/phd/jdp/directory/faculty/boutelle.html" target="_blank"&gt;Kerri Boutelle&lt;/a&gt;'s children were younger, she remembers watching how kids would eat ice cream cones. She noticed a big difference between some siblings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One child would eat half of the ice cream cone and put it down," says Boutelle, who's a psychologist at the University of California, San Diego. Another child would eat their cone extremely fast, grab the leftover cone from the first child, and eat that one, too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, Boutelle has helped children with eating disorders and obesity. This informal experiment, she says, illustrates something Boutelle and other scientists are starting to realize: not all children respond to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/05/25/1178163270/ultra-processed-foods-health-risk-weight-gain" target="_blank"&gt;ultra-processed foods &lt;/a&gt;in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some children are born with what scientists call a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4076308/" target="_blank"&gt;strong food reward drive&lt;/a&gt;, says psychologist &lt;a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/faculty/agearhar.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ashley Gearhardt&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan. They feel extra strong motivation to eat. They're hungry often, may eat quickly, and they don't easily feel full or satiated. Kids with a strong food reward drive can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt;regulate their eating &lt;/a&gt;with whole or minimally processed foods, she says. But with ultra-processed food, they struggle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Popular advice around ultra-processed foods probably isn't going to work well when a kid has a strong food reward drive, Gearhardt adds. They need different help and guidance to feel good and stay healthy in our society, where these foods are ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A strong reward drive served people in times of famine, but it's a nightmare in an ultra-processed food environment," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Does your child have a strong food reward drive?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today children in the U.S. obtain nearly 70% of their calories — on average — from ultra-processed foods, which contain ingredients rarely found in your kitchen, such as preservatives, natural flavors and emulsifiers. Too many of these foods are tied to a whole &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/18/1238939706/ultra-processed-food-junk-food-disease-cancer-anxiety-depression-diet" target="_blank"&gt;host of health problems&lt;/a&gt;, including a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904160/" target="_blank"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322004628" target="_blank"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10512104/" target="_blank"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5787353/" target="_blank"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40513976/" target="_blank"&gt;growing consensus&lt;/a&gt; among scientists that many ultra-processed foods &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(19)30248-7" target="_blank"&gt;trigger people to overeat.&lt;/a&gt; "Ultra-processed foods are engineered for people to over-consume them," says psychiatrist &lt;a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/docs/default-source/events/2022-events/faculties/eating-disorders/dr-agnes-ayton.pdf?sfvrsn=43588ce3_2" target="_blank"&gt;Agnes Ayton&lt;/a&gt; at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in London.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These foods derail two critical aspects of our eating behaviors, Ayton says. They can prompt people to start eating even when they're not hungry, and they can keep us eating even when we're full.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"In our lab, we see that people are pretty good at understanding their hunger and satiety signals when they're eating real food," Gearhardt says. But once you start putting ultra-processed foods on their plates, she says, many people are really bad at eating what their body needs to maintain their weight.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And when you have a strong food reward drive, regulating eating around ultra-processed foods becomes even harder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Let's go back to Kerri Boutelle's experiment with ice cream and look more closely at each child.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first kid, who ate only half the cone, has a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; food reward drive. With kids like this, ultra-processed foods don't alter their behavior all that much, Boutelle says. They typically eat when they're hungry and listen to their satiety signals. "They just eat to get full, and then they move on," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The second child, who ate quickly and grabbed the leftovers, has a strong food reward drive. "They want to eat all the time, and it doesn't matter if they're full," Boutelle says. "Those kids are going to gain weight in today's environment" — unless parents help to protect them from the tricks of ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I always tell parents, 'the environment today tricks kids into overeating,' " she says. "What you can do as a parent is make your home as safe as it can be for your children."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How to help kids with a strong food reward drive&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;   1. Don't keep a bunch of ultra-processed foods around and then try to regulate how much children eat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some families store ultra-processed foods in their home, such as boxes of crackers, granola bars, pretzels and cookies. Then they try to teach children how to eat only a small amount of them at a time, Boutelle says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But that's really difficult for children," she says. "And it's setting them up for failure." In fact, that strategy is really difficult for many adults, as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    2. Try to keep ultra-processed foods out of your home, but allow them elsewhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A more effective strategy is not to buy these foods in the first place. And we know this is hard because the grocery stores are full of them. "But for some kids, it will really be beneficial," Boutelle says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then you can help children learn to make healthy choices around ultra-processed foods when they're outside the home. Our society provides many opportunities to eat these foods, including parties, sporting events and even school, says psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.uwhealth.org/providers/katherine-e-schaumberg-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Katherine Schaumberg&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;You don't want to forbid these foods entirely, she says. That strategy could backfire. "In our culture, food is connection. Having these foods in social settings can facilitate emotional health," she says. "That can outweigh the physical cost of them."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;    3. If you can't keep them all out, keep no more than three ultra-processed items in your house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40513976/" target="_blank"&gt;show that variety &lt;/a&gt;increases eating. So, Boutelle says, limit the options in your home to only a few ultra-processed foods. For example, keep one bag of pretzels and one package of granola bars in the pantry, and that's it. "If you have ice cream, have only one kind," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;     4. Bring ultra-processed foods into your home only on special occasions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To help her two boys learn healthy eating habits, Ashley Gearhardt at the University of Michigan keeps her home basically free of ultra-processed foods. "We have minimally processed foods available to them anytime, except bedtime," she says. "If they're hungry, I tell them, 'Grab a banana, an apple, or some cashews. Go grab the minimally processed popcorn that we've got going on.' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then she buys ultra-processed foods infrequently and only for special events. "Like, 'Oh, we're having a bunch of friends over. Sure, we'll order a bunch of crappy pizza.' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We do not forbid ultra-processed foods, but our baseline is foundationally real food."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This approach works even with her son who has a strong food reward drive, she says. Because he can regulate easily with real food, and he doesn't have to keep resisting the urge for one more cracker, one more pretzel or one more bite of ice cream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year is 2021. No human being has been born since 1995. The United Kingdom is ruled by a dictator, the elderly are being forcibly euthanized, and priests, in the absence of newborns, are baptizing kittens instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the premise of P.D. James’ 1992 novel &lt;em&gt;The Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;. James imagines a society that has seemingly become completely infertile, in which the government has fallen and where Xan Lyppiatt, the tyrant who styles himself “Warden of England,” has instituted a program of mandatory fertility testing. The clock is ticking: In a few years, there will be no humans of childbearing age left to reproduce; in a few decades, there will be no humans left at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this urgency, the Warden’s search for fertile men and women extends only to physically and mentally healthy individuals. This is a world, James tells us, that has become “increasingly intolerant of physical defects”: “no one who was in any way physically deformed, or physically or mentally unhealthy, was on the list of women from whom the new race would be bred.” This doesn’t apply only to people with fatal, incurable, or untreatable medical conditions; a young woman named Julian is exempt simply because two of her fingers are fused together. When Theo Faron, the novel’s protagonist, asks his cousin Xan why such exemptions exist in the first place, the Warden replies, “Why breed from the stupid, the feckless, the violent?” No, if the world is to be repopulated, it must be done with the best genetic material possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In real-life 2025, our society is dissimilar in degree, but not in kind, to the England of &lt;em&gt;The Children of Men&lt;/em&gt;. Across the West, fertility rates have significantly dropped, though this is likely caused by a &lt;a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/how-to-think-about-birthrates-a-multi-factored-approach"&gt;combination of socioeconomic factors&lt;/a&gt; rather than by an unknown medical condition as in James’ novel. Perhaps most disturbingly, some of us have adopted Xan Lyppiatt’s attitude towards procreation: We &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;want to have kids, but only optimal children are desirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;published an &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/01/opinion/ivf-gene-selection-fertility.html"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; by Anna Louie Sussman profiling Noor Siddiqui, the founder and CEO of &lt;a href="https://www.orchidhealth.com/"&gt;Orchid&lt;/a&gt;, a company using gene technology to screen embryos for a plethora of conditions, from rare heart diseases to schizophrenia. Siddiqui’s &lt;a href="https://x.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1907178921315250630?t=NjnlpoqRriklORE9XOencQ&amp;amp;s=03"&gt;X post&lt;/a&gt; about the article went viral—it has over 6 million views to date—and generated a heated debate online about the moral legitimacy of parents carefully selecting the healthiest embryo to use in an IVF pregnancy. Siddiqui’s X thread makes it clear that she’s aware of people’s concerns that she’s “playing God.” She simply doesn’t see a problem with playing God in the first place. Yet, as Sussman puts it in her article, “By giving parents the illusion of so much control, these technologies could lead to viewing embryos as a consumer product while overemphasizing the role of genetics in life outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This desire to “optimize” human life reeks of eugenics, yet many fiercely defend it as morally responsible. &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news-and-events/find-an-expert/professor-julian-savulescu"&gt;Julian Savulescu&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at the University of Oxford, has advocated for “procreative beneficence”—that is, the idea that potential parents using IVF have a moral duty to choose to implant the embryos that are most likely to have the greatest quality of life. Siddiqui’s justification of her company on X follows similar lines: If you want to have children, you should ensure that you’re not passing down any of your health conditions. Everyone’s baby, Siddiqui writes, now “gets to win the genetic lottery” (everyone, at least, who can afford Orchid’s services). And there’s a moving human story to go with this idea: Siddiqui’s mother went blind while Siddiqui was still in elementary school due to an undiagnosed condition. Siddiqui “got lucky” and didn’t inherit the disease. Now, she’s screening her own embryos to make sure that her own children don’t go blind. She calls this “preventing suffering,” &lt;a href="https://x.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1907178921315250630?t=NjnlpoqRriklORE9XOencQ&amp;amp;s=03"&gt;asking&lt;/a&gt;: “If you could prevent your child from going blind—would you?” But the belief that one &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;is taken as a given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality that embryo testing isn’t actually preventing illness, but simply allowing adults to destroy their own “faulty” embryos, seems to escape Siddiqui’s notice. And the fact that if her own genetically suboptimal mother hadn’t chosen to have a child Siddiqui herself wouldn’t exist is entirely ignored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues around children are often cloaked in the veneer of choice—supporters of access to abortion, of course, have long adopted the label “pro-choice.” You &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;have a healthy child, or you &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;have an unhealthy one, or you can have no child at all. You’re the adult. You’re in charge. But choice is often an illusion. On Orchid’s homepage, you’re greeted with a moral imperative: “Have healthy babies.” What is really meant here is closer to “Have genetically optimal babies.” For the last several decades, people have been feeling the pressure to do just that. In my country, the U.K., up to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-51658631"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted. Notoriously, in Iceland the figure has steadily been closer to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37500189"&gt;100 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But conditions like Down syndrome are not hereditary. On the other hand, adults suffering from hereditary conditions might experience judgment if they wish to become parents. Data around how many adults dealing with mental or physical illness choose to have a family is not as readily available, but major outlets routinely run pieces about the childfree by choice movement. An &lt;em&gt;Atlantic &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/12/staying-child-free-for-mental-health-reasons/622667/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from 2016, for instance, collected the stories of mentally ill individuals who remained without children—not only to protect their own mental health, but out of a concern about the potential child’s quality of life. Many reported that the desire to have children was ultimately outweighed by the fear that illnesses like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia would be too great a burden for the potential child to bear. A bipolar woman, Liz, mentioned that she would need a much stronger network of support to consider raising a child who would have to grow up with a bipolar mother and with the potential to develop the same disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding who should be encouraged to reproduce is a task riddled with ethical conundrums. A person struggling with schizophrenia may feel morally compelled to abstain from having children. What about someone with Type 1 diabetes? Or real-life counterparts of P.D. James’ Julian, people born with non-life-threatening deformities? When we start prizing optimal health above all else, where do we draw the line? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I have nothing but sympathy for those who are hesitant to expose their children to hardships, I would also urge them—and all those of us who count as “healthy”—to remember that life &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;hardship. While advancements in medicine and technology allow us to live longer, more comfortable lives, we are a long way away from achieving painlessness, and even longer from being able to predict when suffering will strike. Many parents, mothers especially, begin to struggle with their mental health only &lt;em&gt;after &lt;/em&gt;having children, for a variety of reasons including postpartum psychosis, birth PTSD, and depression. Such conditions can’t be always prevented, and yet those children will inevitably be affected, to varying degrees, by their mother’s psychological issues. More generally, people get cancer. People die in car accidents. Life is unpredictable and paved with suffering; we are deluding ourselves if we believe we can ever have complete control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, one may argue, when it comes to childbearing and childrearing we should try to do everything in our power to prevent pain, even if we can’t entirely eradicate it. On the one hand, we may be concerned about preventing further suffering for the adults involved, as it’s undeniable that embarking on parenthood with preexisting health concerns comes with a unique set of challenges. On the other hand, we may also worry that children born to mentally or physically unwell parents will have harder lives from the outset—in addition to the risk of being born with or developing the same infirmities as those unwell parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To which I respond: What if we are paying for the absence of pain with the absence of joy? What if, by shielding ourselves from suffering, we are closing ourselves off from becoming more hard-working, compassionate, resilient people? We’re refusing to accept the shared responsibility of the care of the sick, the distressed, the vulnerable, both parents and children alike. By doing so, we’re also unintentionally precluding the possibility of strengthening our social bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When preparing to write this essay, I spoke to several women in my local community as well as abroad who are raising children while battling physical and mental disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One woman, a 35-year-old European immigrant to the U.K., has been diagnosed with anxiety disorder, with which she has struggled for years. This was aggravated by undiagnosed postpartum depression after her first child was born (the child is now 5 years old). In 2021, she contracted an autoimmune lung condition, spent two weeks in the hospital, and almost died of pneumonia. Friends, concerned for her wellbeing, told her not to have any more children. A relative openly judged her for trying to get pregnant again. She has since had a second child, one year ago, and she tells me she’d love to have a third. She knows that her issues will inevitably affect her children, but she also believes that what kids need most is to know that they are wanted and loved, and she can provide that: “I’m a good mum. My kids are happy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.juliemachado.pt/"&gt;Julie Machado&lt;/a&gt; is a 39-year-old mother of six, originally from California and now living in Lisbon, Portugal. She always wanted a big family. Everything seemed to be going well until the delivery of her sixth child, during which she suffered an epidural injury. She underwent surgery, but remained in a wheelchair for eight months. Three years on, she can now walk, and her muscle strength is improving, but she still suffers from constant neuropathic pain and still takes opioids—albeit at lower doses—to manage it. In February of this year, Julie discovered she was pregnant with her seventh child. She was initially scared, but seeing her children’s joy at the news of a new sibling, as well as hearing her friends’ promises of help when the baby comes, has helped to assuage her fears. Still, after announcing her seventh pregnancy, she’s dealt with “patronizing” doctors and has received “insulting” criticism from her own sister. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories these women have told me serve as a reminder that we’re very happy to encourage people to have more children—as long as the children in question are born in optimal circumstances, and as long as we don’t have to help raise them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories like these are also found all over the internet. Lizzie Reezay, a popular Christian content creator on YouTube, has made a number of videos over the years on her struggles with bipolar disorder. She used to be decidedly against having her own biological children for fear of passing down the disorder. In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSw4Zz5jsa8"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; about why she later changed her mind, she explains that her own negative experience with her disorder was largely due to the fact that it went undiagnosed until later in her life. “I’ll be the absolute perfect mom in helping them process that, and work through it and heal,” she says about the possibility of her future children struggling with the disorder. “I’ll know every single emotion that they’re feeling and going through.” Lizzie had her first child in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, novelist Victor LaValle wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/09/dont-have-children-mental-health-lavalle"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;about his decision to have a child despite the crippling fear that he would pass down either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, both of which ran in his family. After years of agonizing over the decision, his wife Emily got pregnant. “I realise I might pass down an incurable illness to my son,” LaValle wrote, “but living based on what might go wrong seems like less and less of a life as I get older. The one thing I can try to control is whether I teach my child to be ruled by anxiety, by fear.” LaValle’s openness to life is admirable. And yet, there’s something incredibly striking about one of his additional remarks: “The thing I worry about can’t yet be discovered in any test available to medical science.” That statement is already outdated just over a decade later: Orchid now &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;screen for schizophrenia risk. It’s impossible not to wonder what LaValle would have done if this technology had then been available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, in 2019, then-college student Julian Assele wrote an &lt;a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/04/25/assele-abortion-isnt-mercy/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; criticizing the platitude that abortion is a mercy for unwanted children. He recounts the horrific stories of his fellow foster kids, yet claims that “aborting children is [not] an act of mercy. … It is society’s justification for the erasure of the most vulnerable.” Assele believes that each person’s life is valuable because “each of them has an innate worth. Life is a gift in and of itself, regardless of the circumstances.” His perspective is in stark contrast to public intellectuals like psychoanalyst Erica Komisar, who, despite claiming to be pro-family, warned lawmakers in a 2022 &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-human-cost-of-restricting-abortion-mental-health-depression-anxiety-neglect-dobbs-substance-abuse-unwanted-pregnancy-11659018533"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; that restricting abortion access might result in unwanted children “prone to depression, anxiety, addiction and other social and emotional disorders,” especially if the mother in question was “young and immature.” A sinister message is echoing: A life that begins with a higher probability of certain types of pain is not worth living. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all these theoretical discussions about who should be encouraged to reproduce, we are ignoring the real stories of men and women bravely raising families in adverse circumstances. We’re ignoring the unpredictability of life, and we’re blinding ourselves to the incomparable joy that children bring. When I asked the 35-year-old woman what she would say to people considering having children despite health concerns, she told me that “parents are never perfect” and trauma inevitably gets passed down to children. But, she also said, “every new life is a chance … for redemption. … We are not put here to be happy and comfortable all the time … but to try to be good, to try to be better.” She is confident that focusing on nurturing a child can do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a full-fledged philosophical war taking place in our society. For every Julian Assele, who sees life as inherently precious, there is a selective pronatalist like Komisar, Savulescu, Siddiqui. We are encouraging vulnerable people to deny themselves the joy and responsibility of having a family because figuring out how to help them collectively as a society is harder than just telling them to remain childless. With the right medication, resources, and support at hand, many people whom these selective pronatalists would deem unfit for reproduction—the poor, the young, the disabled, the broken, the despairing—might make excellent parents. Many of them already are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are asking the question of whether individual people, as self-contained, autonomous units, are fit enough to reproduce. That’s the wrong question. We should ask instead: Do we believe that to exist is in itself a good thing? If we don’t, then we’re not much different from the society of P.D. James’ dystopian imagination. If we do, we must be prepared to share the joys as well as the burdens of existence with the vulnerable and the imperfect—that is, all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

But it wasn't designed for sitting still,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is designed to move. It doesn't matter how ergonomic your office chair is, the height of your screen or even having a standing desk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not the answer to keeping your spine healthy. Movement is.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst he acknowledged that these alterations may help improve posture, the best thing to do is take regular breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I set a chime on my [computer] desktop every hour signalling that it is time to get up and move,' he suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the back expert, movement is absolutely crucial to spine health, as this exercises the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Dr Natalia sedentary lifestyles spent looking at screens will cause havoc for your back as you age &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tissue loading, which occurs when the muscles contract, is optimal for skeletal health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this followed up by a period of rest—for example returning to your desk—the tissue becomes more resistant, building up back strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said this is particularly crucial for under 35-year-olds, who are still building bone mass, making it a critical time to implement practices that promote bone density and strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peak bone mass, which typically occurs between 25 and 35-years-old is the highest amount of bone tissue an individual can attain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Failure to build strong bones during this phase of life can increase the risk of osteoporosis—a health condition that weakens bones—and fractures in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's all about forming habits when you're young,' Dr Natalia warned. 'If you don't use it, you'll lose it.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, it's not too late for people who have surpassed the building block years, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My main message to everyone is to stay active, don't be afraid and push through the pain.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whilst he said building bone density and strength is crucial for young people it is never too late to incorporate movement into your daily routine to protect your spine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst this might seem counter-intuitive, Dr Natalia said the best thing for people who have experienced back pain is to stay active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People become really inactive when they are suffering from back pain, partly because they are scared of it becoming something more serious and partly because they have been told that rest is the best thing for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This couldn't be further from the truth,' he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst he acknowledged that some pain is more severe than others, he said it is a common misconception that when something hurts it is causing harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People too often confuse hurt and harm', he explained. 'Whilst pushing through may be painful, it is often the best thing you can do for your spine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Remember modification is always better than stopping altogether.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who are more prone to back pain, Dr Natalia suggested swapping out high impact workouts like running for something more gentle, like pilates or swimming when the pain is worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Norwegian and Danish researchers have recently revealed that being on your feet for over an hour-and-a-half every day could slash the risk of chronic lower back pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However if the pain is persistent and does not improve after six weeks of rest, taking over-the-counter painkillers such as Ibuprofen and physical therapy, this could be a red-flag warning sign of something more serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, Dr Natalia advises contacting your GP who may refer you to a specialist for MRI imaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he said that 90 per cent of cases do no progress to this stage and that most people should get better with a combination of physical therapy and painkillers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best piece of advice I can give is don't be scared of your back and stay active.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as exercising regularly, making sure to stand up every hour, Dr Natalia said he also focuses on his diet, taking probiotics every day—which promote healthy bacteria in the gut—avoiding processed foods and refined sugar and eating a largely anti-inflammatory diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeons top tips come as new research has suggested that only one in ten treatments for back pain actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts from the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-south-wales/index.html" id="mol-204ffd90-67da-11f0-a800-1fad4830ed3e" class=""&gt;New South Wales&lt;/a&gt; found that just one treatment for acute lower back pain and five treatments for chronic—or long-term—back pain were 'efficacious'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These included non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, for short-term back pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For long-term back pain, the treatments found to be effective were exercise, spinal manipulative therapy, taping, antidepressants and drugs that target the pain receptors transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings will come as a blow to the millions of Americans and Brits who suffer from back pain, which can often be debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the most common form of pain experienced by adults, with lower back pain affecting six in ten people in the UK, and eight in ten in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there is usually no immediately identifiable cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if entry-level jobs haven’t vanished? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What if we’re just not equipping young people with the skills those roles now call for? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, we told a generation that their future would be secured if they just mastered coding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We restructured high schools around tech labs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/the-bard-and-the-boardroom-why-todays-best-leaders-read-more-than-metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Diminished humanities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; departments. Smirked at philosophy degrees. We insisted that fluency in logic, math, and engineering would lead to stable, well-compensated careers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But now, artificial intelligence is doing the coding. And the jobs we built our education systems around? They’re the first being automated away. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The tough truth: we spent years preparing students to behave like machines, just as machines learned to do their jobs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The issue isn’t that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/07/talent-development-in-the-future-of-work-starts-with-a-career-climbing-wall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;first step on the career ladder is gone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It’s that it shifted, and we’re still looking for it in the old place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Change We Didn’t Anticipate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The early-career jobs that once served as stepping stones into roles like analyst, marketer, developer, or support staff are no longer the go-to entry. Employers are now leaning on AI to complete those tasks more efficiently and at lower cost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The people still succeeding? They aren’t necessarily those with the newest diplomas or technical badges. They’re the ones with insight. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/working-smarter-with-ai-why-critical-thinking-is-still-your-superpower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Judgment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Human nuance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hiringlab.org/2025/04/01/february-2025-jolts-report-scared-of-our-own-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;JOLTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; numbers, U.S. hiring has dropped to a level not seen in over seven years. And the hit to early-career roles is even steeper — &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/macro/white-collar-workers-are-getting-the-blues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Revelio Labs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that white-collar entry-level postings dropped 12.7% in the past year. Jobs like software development and business analysis saw declines near 25%. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And this downturn is gaining speed. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/julianhayesii/2025/05/31/ceos-jensen-huang-and-dario-amodei-on-ai-adapt-or-be-replaced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;cautioned &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that we’re “sleepwalking into mass unemployment,” warning that half of today’s entry-level knowledge jobs could be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/anthropic-ceo-warns-ai-will-swiftly-decimate-entry-level-white-collar-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;gone in five years&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. These aren’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/u-s-secretary-of-commerce-says-factory-jobs-for-life-is-the-future-of-work-for-you-your-kids-and-your-grandkids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;manufacturing roles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. They’re junior-level positions in finance, media, tech, and law — the exact tracks young professionals were steered toward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This doesn’t signal the collapse of opportunity; it marks a necessary correction. One that exposes what we’ve been missing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;We Focused on the Wrong Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI can’t replicate lived experience. It doesn’t read social signals in a client pitch, weigh complex trade-offs, or assess team dynamics mid-crisis. It doesn’t know when to push, when to pause, or how to build trust across functions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those capabilities used to be built gradually — on the job, through exposure, mentorship, and real-world trial and error. But if AI is stepping into roles that once served as that training ground, we now face a new challenge: how to teach the human elements earlier. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While tech skills are being automated at lightning speed, AI still lacks imagination, empathy, moral reasoning, and contextual awareness. In a world powered by machines, it’s no longer about having the right answer. It’s about knowing the right questions, reading the full picture, and leading people through uncertainty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We haven’t been preparing students for that. In the U.S., the percentage of degrees in the humanities has&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amacad.org/humanities-indicators/higher-education/bachelors-degrees-humanities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;dropped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from over 17% in the late 1960s to under 9% in 2022. Since the early 2000s, degrees in fields like English, history, and languages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailynous.com/2024/01/16/demographic-trends-in-the-us-philosophy-major-2001-2022-guest-post/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;span&gt;have nearly halved&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Philosophy majors are now just 0.4% of all college graduates. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We treated this as evolution. As practicality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now we’re realizing it was a mistake. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Human Skills Are the Real Competitive Edge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most crucial skills in this AI era aren’t “soft” — they’re essential. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Empathy. Persuasion. Ethical reasoning. Cultural literacy. Systems thinking. Creativity in uncertain terrain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These skills are honed through literature, political science, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://allwork.space/2025/05/four-commitments-of-successful-anthropological-leaders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;anthropology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, ethics, philosophy, which are disciplines we’ve steadily pushed to the margins. Not because of nostalgia, but because they’re strategic assets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when AI can produce answers instantly, the advantage goes to those who know what matters, how to frame problems, and how to communicate meaning. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If we want to prepare future workers for a world where machines handle the tasks, we must reinvest in what makes us human. That means restoring the humanities — not as electives, but as core professional competencies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It means broadening how we evaluate talent to include clarity, curiosity, and adaptability, not just credentials. And it means recalibrating STEM education to include ethics, systems awareness, and human-centered thinking. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This isn’t about going back in time. It’s about catching up with the world we’ve already stepped into. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We trained a generation for technical precision, just as that became commoditized by machines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now it’s time to invest in something AI can’t do: being deeply, powerfully human. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because when the bots deliver the output, the real value lies with the person who sees the bigger story, and knows why it matters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What seemed like a harmless appointment quickly turned into something far more serious—one that would eventually land him in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Kennedy, 68, went in for a simple X-ray before routine surgery, expecting it to be a quick visit. Instead, doctors spotted scarring on his lungs. Kennedy, a healthy, active retired Air Force tech who trained therapy dogs, had no clue anything was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pulmonary Hypertension: Recognizing the critical symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after more tests, he got hit with a tough diagnosis: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) — a lung disease with no clear cause that slowly robs you of breath, CBS News reported. At first, he thought he could fight it off. But by 2024, his doctors gave him a heartbreaking prognosis: less than a year to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later he underwent a lung transplant and his lung capacity is currently 98%. "He is back to spending time with his wife, children and grandkids. He is able to exercise at home and was recently able to take his dog for a walk without losing his breath. He's almost done training the canine, a Bernese Mountain dog named Fini, to be a hospital therapy dog," the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis: The lung disease you’ve probably never heard of—but should&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about your lungs—not in a scary way, but in a “this-is-good-to-know” way. There’s a sneaky disease out there called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF for short. It sounds like a mouthful, and honestly, it kind of is. But here’s the deal: this condition is serious, underdiagnosed, and affects thousands of people, especially older adults. And the kicker? We still don’t really know what causes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So, what exactly is IPF?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a disease that messes with your lungs by causing scar tissue to build up inside them. Think of it like slowly wrapping your lungs in shrink-wrap. The more scar tissue, the harder it is to breathe. Over time, people with IPF find themselves gasping for air just doing simple things like walking to the kitchen or climbing a few stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word “idiopathic” basically means “we don’t know why it happens,” which is a frustrating part of this disease. Unlike lung issues caused by smoking, pollution, or working in dusty environments, IPF just shows up uninvited. No clear reason, no obvious trigger. One day your lungs are fine, and the next, they start stiffening up like they’re made of cardboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the signs something’s wrong?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get tricky. The symptoms of IPF are super vague—things like a dry cough that won’t quit or being out of breath more than usual. It’s easy to write these off as just getting older, being out of shape, or dealing with allergies. That’s why so many people get diagnosed late, sometimes when the disease has already taken a major toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pulmonary-fibrosis/introduction/symptoms" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Lung Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, IPF can sneak up on people because its symptoms often mimic other, more common lung issues. Most folks start noticing signs somewhere between age 50 and 70, but by then, it’s easy to chalk things up to aging or being “a little out of shape.” That’s why it’s crucial to speak up if you feel something’s off—especially if you’re out of breath from basic activities, dealing with a nagging dry cough, or feeling unusually tired. Even symptoms like unintended weight loss, achy joints, or weird changes in your fingertips (called “clubbing”) could be clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got any family history of lung disease or have worked around chemicals or pollutants, don’t keep it to yourself—tell your doctor. And don’t be afraid to push for answers if your symptoms aren’t improving. PF has many causes, and getting the right diagnosis means seeing a specialist who knows what to look for. Early action can help manage symptoms and give you more control over your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why IPF deserves more attention right now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, let’s face it—breathing is kind of a big deal. You don’t want to take it for granted. If you or someone you love is dealing with a mysterious cough or unexplained shortness of breath, it’s worth getting it checked out. The sooner IPF is caught, the more options you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 05:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxPNGR2ZkZxc3lfejUtM1hSWEg5TUtMN0Y1alI4MlBYSzVUNlB1cXM0RkRfLTRPRE1tNXF1eFhxNGVKai1sTzFmWWlKbmpjcExGWlFQVXdfWmdpQzdFT2pMRUhHMlV4N0czYzhFa1BJT3l4emd2cVNEb1VudHUzUHh6b0RPMDBzQkFHeGdWTEhGa2M4YjlNTzBLaW1ZSUlJYndQUTREM3ROR2FmOUxTMmJWSEVtQTdvRk5rVjN6UzNla0haWnR3Q2hPTVJuLVdLYi1lbUctN2hkNWpWVXQ0Y1Q5dVMwSDM1cHNVMGtucGNudXZFR1FlaTN5Si1sS3BFZE9wRzNKNHdHMTFOWVVleElhaHMwSWk5c0d5cU54MVlQUWpTdw</guid></item><item><title>为什么6 ‑ 6 ‑ 6步行程序正在传播病毒，以及它如何支持减肥和心理健康-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAJBVV95cUxQQnN2Y2RobDdlUl9fd0piVWNxaEFvMlpVZmk4bzhMdWFXWEM5U1hYMXN5WWhZLVpmWThSX1J4Ri1PcDVjN24yQ3ZnSnlEcGNFbDRURzNJSTRMdV9VaGpiNWc4TkhIRmZrNTRfNDhTMU1hLTQxV1pjTnBZQ3FpNGpuQzZMVVB3Y292QUdZSDBDblp5OFdMNG1sWGpiYjAxWWxjbjV4TXNRTm05NExubExkclNYQ256MEhKeGNKczlFbi1sdmNjbFdQVUEzdVg3anRnQzBkWm44a2w5d2c5STJGYlM2dERlZEtaT1ZSc0xkNkl6NTA1MmtpX0RGdDVvYkp1ZXVUT3I5Ty00MEhKS3BsQmFSRTdoMDdoMlNiNQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 walking challenge has taken over social media, Instagram, and wellness blogs, despite its name sounding a bit ominous. The format is simple: walk for 60 minutes at a brisk pace, with a 6-minute warm-up and 6-minute cool-down, ideally starting at 6 a.m. or 6 p.m. Some people also interpret it as walking 6,000 steps per day for 6 days a week, offering a more flexible version that still builds daily consistency. Its popularity stems from the structure being catchy, easy to remember, and practical. Many find that having a set walking time reduces decision fatigue and makes the habit easier to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the 6-6-6 walking format helps build healthy habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and fitness coaches say the challenge works because it’s structured but not extreme. Committing to an hour of walking at a fixed time each day helps people incorporate physical activity into their daily routine. Doing it in the morning or evening also means it’s more likely to become a ritual, much like brushing your teeth. This kind of consistency is key for habit formation, especially for those new to fitness or trying to lose weight without joining a gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;From right shoes to warming up right: 5 safety rules to follow while walking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What science says about walking and your health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking remains one of the most underrated yet powerful forms of exercise. According to a 2021 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34477847/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in JAMA Network Open, walking at least 7,000 steps a day was associated with a 50–70% lower risk of mortality in middle-aged adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 challenge typically pushes you into that beneficial 6,000–7,000 step range within an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking also keeps your heart rate in the “Zone 2” aerobic range (50–70% of your maximum heart rate), which supports fat metabolism and endurance without stressing your joints. As supported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6355121/?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;data &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;from the American College of Sports Medicine, this level of aerobic activity helps improve cardiovascular function, insulin sensitivity, and even mood by lowering anxiety and depression levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the 6-6-6 walk help with weight loss?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, but with a caveat. Walking can contribute to fat loss when paired with a calorie-controlled diet. On its own, though, walking an hour daily without adjusting your nutrition may lead to slower results. According to a study published in Obesity, participants who exercised in the morning (between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.) tended to have lower BMI and waist circumference. However, the researchers noted that these were correlations, not definitive proof that walking in the morning alone causes weight loss. Personal experiences vary. One lifestyle writer reported improved alertness and energy but couldn’t sustain the routine due to fatigue and scheduling issues. Another participant enjoyed clocking over 15,000 steps a day but found the two-hour daily commitment excessive compared to her regular fitness plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who benefits most from the 6-6-6 walking challenge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This walking challenge is ideal for beginners, people returning to fitness, or those looking for a low-impact exercise they can do daily. It’s inclusive, requires no special equipment, and can be done anywhere; just lace up your shoes and head outside or hop on a treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if your schedule is inconsistent or you're already doing intense workouts, the strict daily structure might not be sustainable. Fitness experts suggest adapting the plan: you can split the walk into two 30-minute sessions or do it five days a week instead of six. The goal is to make it fit your lifestyle, not disrupt it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The wellness benefits of sticking to the 6‑6‑6 walking challenge&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a consistent walking habit go far beyond calorie burn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improves fat metabolism: Brisk walking encourages your body to burn fat more efficiently without the high-impact strain of running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improves heart and metabolic health: Regular aerobic activity helps regulate blood sugar, cholesterol, and blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhances mood and reduces stress: Walking outdoors, especially in the morning, exposes you to natural light, which supports your circadian rhythm and can ease anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthens muscles and bones: As a weight-bearing exercise, walking supports lower body strength and helps prevent bone density loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-6-6 walking challenge offers a simple yet effective way to commit to daily movement. It’s backed by research showing the benefits of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and structured routines. While it won’t work miracles overnight, it can be a powerful habit when combined with balanced nutrition and realistic goals. If you're looking to boost your fitness, improve mental clarity, or simply get moving again, the 6-6-6 challenge is worth trying; just be sure to adjust the format to suit your needs and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/is-your-pillow-silently-damaging-your-neck-new-findings-explain-why-you-wake-up-sore/articleshow/122932054.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Is your pillow silently damaging your neck?

But what if there’s a scan that could tell you your real heart attack risk long before symptoms show up? There is a quick, painless CT scan that looks for calcium buildup in your arteries (a major red flag for heart disease). It’s way more accurate at predicting future heart attacks than just looking at cholesterol alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kicker? Most people have never even heard of it. Whether you're in your 40s and feeling fine or just curious about your long-term heart health, this scan might be the wake-up call you didn’t know you needed. Here's what it is, how it works, and why it might just save your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the &lt;keyword id="28027653" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Coronary-Artery-Calcium-Test" source="keywords"&gt;Coronary Artery Calcium Test&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAC test is a simple, non-invasive CT scan (a type of X-ray) that looks specifically for calcium deposits in the coronary arteries the blood vessels that supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood. These calcium spots are essentially hardened bits of plaque resulting from the buildup of fats, cholesterol, and other substances in your arteries (a process called atherosclerosis). The presence and amount of calcium in your arteries signal the extent of coronary artery disease (CAD), which is the main cause of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What do you think is the most important factor in assessing heart health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: Your cholesterol test gives you clues, but it’s kind of like guessing what’s inside a wrapped gift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAC test is like unwrapping it to see if there’s actually something you should worry about inside your arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A coronary calcium scan isn't for everyone, but it's the finest way for those who are uncertain about their heart disease risk to make better decisions about treatment and medications," &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-heart-test-you-may-need-but-likely-havent-heard-of" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;says &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this test a game changer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people rely on cholesterol levels (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol) and traditional risk calculators to estimate their heart attack risk. But these don’t always tell the whole story. The CAC test:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detects plaque buildup early often before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helps predict your actual heart attack risk better than cholesterol numbers alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guides decisions on preventative treatment, especially whether or not you should start or continue statin medications (which lower cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gives you a clear calcium score, a numeric value that correlates with your risk level — from zero (no calcium, low risk) to over 1,000 (very high risk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should consider getting a CAC Test?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test isn’t for everyone. Various health guidelines suggest considering it if you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are between 40-80 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have an intermediate risk of heart disease based on risk factors like age, blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, or family history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are unsure whether to start statin therapy or want to weigh benefits versus possible side effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have a family history of early heart disease but otherwise seem low-risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your healthcare provider can help you decide if this test makes sense for you. It’s not typically recommended if you have low risk or already have known heart disease, because other tests may be better suited then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies in the US consistently highlight how the CAC test improves risk prediction. For example, the MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) showed that CAC scoring can better identify those at risk of heart attack who might have been missed by traditional risk calculators. The test also helps avoid unnecessary statin use in low-risk people scoring zero, reducing overtreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about your heart health but don’t have clear symptoms, and your cholesterol or risk scores seem “in the middle,” a CAC test can be a powerful eye-opener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s something wild—Johns Hopkins researchers studied nearly 7,000 people to see how well we’re actually predicting heart risk. They looked at two methods: one used the usual risk factors like cholesterol levels, smoking habits, blood pressure, and diabetes. The other added in results from a Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) scan—that quick CT scan that checks for calcium buildup in your heart arteries. Turns out, adding the CAC scan seriously sharpened the accuracy. According to a 2013 study published in the European Heart Journal, some people who were told they were at very low risk based on traditional factors actually had high calcium scores—15% of them, in fact. That’s a big deal. Even more surprising? Around 35% of people flagged as high risk had zero calcium buildup, meaning they might not be in as much danger as once thought. Bottom line: the CAC test can change how we see and treat heart risk—big time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s quick, painless, and offers a peek inside your arteries that cholesterol tests simply can’t. The real value?

The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has shown no signs of settling into a predictable “endemic” state falsely promised by official scientists and COVID contrarians alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current surge is being propelled by two dominant variants: NB.1.8.1, dubbed “Nimbus,” and XFG, known as “Stratus,” which together represent a new phase of viral evolution. NB.1.8.1 now accounts for 43 percent of US cases, while XFG has rapidly spread worldwide and comprises the third most prevalent strain nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.pmc19.com/data/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; (PMC) from Tulane University, the most consistent public dashboard available in the US, new daily infections reached 347,000 by July 21, with forecasts suggesting this number will nearly double by next month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative ma0 overflow-hidden  dn-p"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="db avenir f7 f6-m lh-title black-60 tc pt3 ph3"&gt;This graph shows the current forecast of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, with daily new infections now approaching 500,000 &lt;span classname="black-40 nowrap"&gt;[Photo by PMC via Dr. Mike Hoerger]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extrapolating from these data, the PMC estimates that over the coming month there will be between 6,700 and 11,200 excess deaths due to COVID-19, while up to 3.76 million Americans will join the tens of millions more already suffering from Long COVID. Strikingly, they estimate that the average American has now been infected 3.85 times, meaning more than 1 billion COVID-19 infections have occurred in the US since the pandemic began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that official deaths in the US continue to remain elevated at &lt;a href="https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2025/07/23/first-half-us-death-count-still-106-higher-than-before-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;10.6 percent above pre-pandemic levels&lt;/a&gt;, underscoring the ongoing mortality burden caused by the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current crisis represents the culmination of a bipartisan war on public health, which began not with Trump’s return to power but with the Biden administration’s systematic dismantling of COVID-19 protections. Biden’s September 2022 declaration that “the pandemic is over” set the stage for today’s wholesale dismantling of all public health measures under the diktats of the anti-vaccine quack Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since taking control of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Kennedy has unleashed an unprecedented assault on federal health agencies. HHS employment has been slashed from 82,000 to 62,000 workers through mass firings, buyouts and early retirements. The agency’s 28 divisions are being consolidated to just 15, with numerous offices entirely shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed fiscal year 2026 budget, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) faces a staggering $18 billion cut—a 40 percent reduction that would devastate medical research. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would lose $3.6 billion, more than half its budget, with critical programs for chronic disease prevention, HIV surveillance and global health monitoring eliminated entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These coincide with a calculated undermining of the scientific method itself. Kennedy has fired vaccine experts, rescinded evidence-based flu shot recommendations, and on Friday announced plans to fire all 16 members of the US Preventive Services Task Force, which determines what cancer screenings and preventive health services insurers must cover. The administration has canceled more than $11 billion in funding to state and local health departments, severing the connections between federal agencies and frontline public health workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative ma0 overflow-hidden  dn-p"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="db avenir f7 f6-m lh-title black-60 tc pt3 ph3"&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (right) with Argentina's fascist President Javier Milei  &lt;span classname="black-40 nowrap"&gt;[Photo: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing of this assault on public health is particularly sinister. As new COVID-19 variants drive hospitalizations higher and Long COVID cases mount, the administration is systematically destroying the capacity to monitor, respond to and mitigate all disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, these deepening attacks on public health take place as scientific evidence provides deeper insight into one of the pandemic’s most devastating long-term consequences: widespread neurological damage that will burden the working class for generations. Two landmark studies published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; provide forensic evidence of COVID-19’s assault on brain health, exposing the criminal negligence of all those who falsely declared the pandemic “over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61033-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that simply living through the pandemic—even without infection—accelerated brain aging equivalent to 5.5 extra months, with the greatest impacts on older adults, men and people from disadvantaged backgrounds. For those confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19, this brain aging was linked to measurable cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More alarming still, the &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ads5006" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can directly trigger the formation of amyloid-β plaques—the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Using lab-grown human retinal models and postmortem tissue from COVID-19 patients, researchers found viral proteins embedded within these plaques, suggesting COVID-19 may initiate or accelerate neurodegeneration through direct biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientist Leslie M. Kay’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9377782/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prophetic 2022 warning&lt;/a&gt; of “a looming wave of dementia” now appears grimly prescient. The persistent loss of smell and taste affecting millions of COVID-19 survivors may signal early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, as the virus inflames the olfactory bulb, an area crucial for memory and emotion. Critically, this damage occurs even in mild cases, meaning the neurological toll extends far beyond those who were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These policies amount to what Friedrich Engels termed “social murder”—the systematic creation of conditions that shorten working class lives. The &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33465" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$156 billion in Social Security savings&lt;/a&gt; from COVID-19 excess deaths is not incidental but rather is built into the strategy. By gutting the public health system, the Trump administration is engineering a rise in death rates to reduce liabilities to Medicare and Social Security, freeing up funds for militarism and tax cuts for the rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent gruesome and preventable workplace deaths of &lt;a href="/en/articles/2025/07/26/bpni-j26.html"&gt;Ronald Adams Sr. and Brayan Neftali Otoniel Canu Joj&lt;/a&gt; underscore this reality. They are among the over 140,000 workers who die each year from hazardous working conditions in America’s industrial slaughterhouse, including over 5,000 from traumatic injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams, a 63-year-old machine repairman at Stellantis’ Dundee Engine Plant, was crushed to death in April when an overhead gantry suddenly activated while he was performing maintenance. Brayan, a 19-year-old immigrant worker from Guatemala, was killed while cleaning an industrial meat grinder at the Tina’s Burritos plant in Vernon, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wholesale attack on science, public health and workplace safety serves multiple functions for the ruling elite. It eliminates inconvenient evidence of ongoing health crises, dismantles the limited institutions ostensibly overseeing workplace safety like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and normalizes mass death as an acceptable cost of maintaining profits. The firing of public health experts and the defunding of disease surveillance ensure that future outbreaks will be met with ignorance rather than science-based responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers must recognize that these interconnected policies represent class warfare from above. The pandemic exposed capitalism’s fundamental inability to protect human life when it conflicts with profit-making. Now, as the virus continues to evolve and spread, the ruling class is deliberately blinding the population to the consequences rather than implementing the public health measures necessary to end the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The working class must organize to reclaim public health and healthcare as fundamental social rights, grounded in science, international cooperation and the principle that no death is acceptable when the tools exist to prevent it. Only through the socialist transformation of society will human lives be prioritized over private profit and the pandemic ended once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="dn-p relative mv4 _bt _bb"&gt;&lt;div type="custom-code" class="ph3 ph4-ns"&gt;&lt;aside class="dn-p relative mv4 _bt _bb"&gt;&lt;div class="mw6 mw7-l _mw-75rem-l center bg-black-05 br2"&gt;&lt;div id="donate" class="mt4 mb0 pa3 pa4-l _bt _bw1"&gt;&lt;p class="avenir f4 f3-ns b lh-title"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;World Socialist Web Site&lt;/em&gt; is the voice of the working class and the leadership of the international socialist movement.

The order you eat your food can help control blood sugar. Start with non‑starchy vegetables like salad or stir-fried greens, then move on to protein and good fats like dal, paneer, eggs, nuts or seeds. Finally, finish with carbohydrates such as roti, rice, or millet. Eating this way slows down digestion and helps avoid sudden glucose spikes. It also boosts insulin response, helps you feel full longer, and supports better metabolic health. Perfect for people with pre‑diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or anyone wanting steadier energy levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is &lt;keyword id="20112381" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="meal-sequencing" source="keywords"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/keyword&gt; and how it works in controlling blood sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meal sequencing refers to eating your meal components in a specific order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetables (especially non‑starchy/fiber-rich)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proteins and healthy fats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbohydrates (grains, starches, or sweets)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating fiber and protein first slows gastric emptying and reduces the rate at which carbohydrates are absorbed.

GLP‑1 release and insulin efficiency: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein and fat eaten first increase incretin hormones like GLP‑1, triggering better insulin response and slowing down glucose absorption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Delayed gastric emptying: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting meals with fibre and fats slows digestion, leading to a gradual blood sugar rise rather than a sudden spike&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Improved insulin sensitivity: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent sequencing may gradually enhance the body's insulin function, benefiting long‑term metabolic health.

Elevated levels of these can pose a risk to cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sophia Gedgaudas, a stroke survivor, is the reigning women's champion at Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High Lipoprotein (a) is a genetic condition that creates a new form of cholesterol in the body that is similar to LDL (bad) cholesterol but has an additional protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This new kind of cholesterol causes a buildup of plaque in arteries, triggering inflammation and increased blood clotting, ultimately hindering blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, people with this condition have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes - even if they take precautionary measures such as eating health and not smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five Americans, or around 64 million people, suffer from high lipoprotein(a).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Gedgaudas's case, her condition created a blood clot in her brain that resulted in a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, about 800,000 Americans experience a stroke each year while an estimated 138,000 Americans die from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While usually associated with older populations, recent data indicates a concerning increase in stroke rates among individuals aged between 18 and 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 120,000 Americans under the age of 50 and 1.5 million young adults worldwide suffer a stroke each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sedentary lifestyles, poor diet, substance abuse (including smoking and excessive alcohol consumption), and stress are increasingly recognized as major contributors to stroke in young adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the website: 'It was a complete shock.

No one ever expected someone like me to have high cholesterol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But because of my genetics, my lipoprotein(a) level raised my cholesterol to dangerous levels and that's ultimately what caused my stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the time, I was completely paralyzed and could only respond with one word: "yeah." That's all I could say.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gedgaudas pictured here two days before she suffered a life-changing stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors told her that she had extremely high cholesterol due to a hereditary condition known as high lipoprotein (a)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gedgaudas's doctors initially prescribed her a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) - a medication used to treat heart attacks by dissolving blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, due to the large size of the clot, the medication failed to work and she was forced to undergo a thrombectomy, a procedure where doctors insert a catheter into an artery through the groin to remove the clot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while doctors were able to successfully remove the life-threatening clot, she was left partially deaf as the stroke damaged parts of her brain responsible for hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The intensive surgery combined with the paralysis she suffered left Gedgaudas struggling to recover for three years, relearning how to walk, talk, eat and read. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this time, she watched numerous wrestling matches and decided she wanted to pursue the sport rather than becoming a pilot and cheerleader. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She now battles a hearing disability, another long-term effect of the stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The now 25-year-old said: 'My dad would sit with me in the ICU and put wrestling on the TV. My mom says the first time I smiled after the stroke was while watching wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Later, my brother took me to a live show, and after we left, I said, "That's what I'm going to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There were days I didn't want to get out of bed. I was angry, I was depressed. But watching wrestling made me believe I could do something again. It gave me hope and purpose.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once being given the green light by her entire medical team in 2022, she began training to be a professional wrestler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, she made her debut and quickly became a standout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Gedgaudas is the reigning women's champion at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-c39760a0-52c8-11f0-a7ef-eb27e70b591a"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-c396eb70-52c8-11f0-a7ef-eb27e70b591a" class=""&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; - where wrestling legends John Cena, Dave Batista, Brock Lesnar and Randy Orton started their road to stardom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gedgaudas's condition caused a blood clot in her brain, resulting in a stroke and left her paralyzed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For the future, Gedgaudas has global ambitions and hopes to one day wrestle internationally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told DailyMail.com: 'Being part of OVW means everything to me. There's so much history here and amazing wrestlers that have come through, and I want to be one of the names. I want to show people a disability shouldn't stop anyone from reaching the top.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gedgaudas continued: 'For a long time, I was embarrassed that I was partially deaf. I saw it as a weakness and didn't want anyone to think I was limited. But over time, I realized it's just part of who I am - and there's nothing to be ashamed of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, I embrace it. I've learned to adapt in ways that work for me. I've gotten good at reading lips, and in the ring, I naturally turn my good ear toward the sound so I can hear what I need to. Most importantly, I stay super focused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By staying locked in, I'm able to catch cues and respond without missing a beat. It's not always easy, but I've found ways to make it work - and even turn it into a strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have to read matches differently, and I rely on instincts and body language. It forces me to be completely in the moment, and I think it makes me a better performer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To stay healthy and prevent another stroke, Gedgaudas workouts and follows a special diet comprised of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins including chicken and fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the future, Gedgaudas has global ambitions and hopes to one day wrestle internationally. But for now, her mission is personal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want to wrestle in the UK, Japan, anywhere. But more than that, I want to keep helping people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's why I do this. Wrestling saved my life, and now I want to help someone else believe they can fight through whatever they're facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 03:48:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOVG9QX1JQRThyUFBDOWttSGppNVRRYUxiaDc3NTZ3Ulp6OWRlMVVrZEZheFltQnhLa2Q3VG5mUnM2TmVad3poUE9MYWdCQk5kWHVnWWZLd3hET3BmbWVsUXpHbkRaRFhhT0lySmFZNzJtUUtKczdILWVhcXk0SUt3S3poVjYxaGVSM0JZOGVGVEYtMVE3Z0Y3YU5zeVZkZ1pmYVBYbNIBqgFBVV95cUxPQ1ZPQXBpVURXSVZWUUd5ejBOdGFmYW5zX3hGVHhseDhqZk9pWDNvR2tFRVhmMFVCSy1QV3RqOEZSSTdYdmlSWXdUZDFDZUwxbW8xa2JqcmwyNEgtR0E2dkN2QU9lV1VwV3psZXNXSkR5VXd0T3dJa0x2ektNWTV5dTFqQlVXMWJoNTFZSTZjdkwtY0pXcUZmRnVfZXJ2S0tkQXJRVVNHbWU5UQ</guid></item><item><title>新型牙线可替代疫苗针头，研究结果- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRVgtS0tWZGx5Nl9COGJjVUlkTG5ZZXhKT1hRYVN1MW82SE1aaVViY2lfXzExRjU3a3pCZFZLeDZ0Yi1EakVodWlQLWxEczY1eTMyT2xuN3NoM0RuTEw1cHhzdjlOZUNQNjNzVDU4NlBZdU5jYmVkRTFWVnhOSE1JejgzSjA5U1k3TThJdFNUNXJIYkNtc1M0Nno5SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A fear of needles is a common reason for avoiding vaccines, even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721002609"&gt;among many adults&lt;/a&gt;. Now researchers have come up with a rather clever alternative: dental floss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Texas Tech University, the researchers first identified an often overlooked surface in the mouth as an entry point for vaccines: the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junctional_epithelium"&gt;junctional epithelium&lt;/a&gt; (JE), which sits where the gums meet the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The JE is leaky by design, because it allows &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-centuries-old-hack-is-a-proven-way-to-boost-your-health-and-immunity"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; to move around and defend the oral cavity from bacterial attack. The researchers wondered whether this could also make this part of the mouth a suitable target for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hypothesized that this leakiness of the JE could expedite the entry of vaccine antigens, and the abundance of immune cells in this microenvironment could elicit an adaptive immune response," the researchers &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in their recently published paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-arm-gets-vaccinated-could-play-a-role-in-your-immune-response?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Which Arm Gets Vaccinated Could Play a Role in Your Immune Response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering medications to the JE is complicated by the tissue's seclusion within the gumline, which is why it hasn't really been considered as a potential location &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2014.05.060"&gt;for introducing vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where floss comes in, which is perfect for getting into tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their hypothesis by coating dental floss with different &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-pfizer-and-moderna-vaccines-are-a-breakthrough-here-s-how-they-work"&gt;types of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and testing them on mice across a period of several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169026" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss.jpg" alt="Mouse flossing diagram" class="wp-image-169026 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/MouseFloss-600x246.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169026" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers targeted a specific part of the mouth in mice. (Ingrole et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Biomed. Eng.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were numerous encouraging indicators: strong &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-arm-gets-vaccinated-could-play-a-role-in-your-immune-response"&gt;immune responses&lt;/a&gt; were observed in the mouth and throughout the bodies of the mice, and the floss vaccine was effective in protecting mice against a later  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="169023" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests were conducted on human volunteers using dye rather than a vaccine, since  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="169023" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are still some way off. The amount of dye that reached the JE target via flossing was enough to suggest that this really could work in us too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings establish floss-based vaccination as a simple, needle-free strategy that enhances vaccine delivery and immune activation compared with existing mucosal immunization methods," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not the first time scientists have looked beyond the thorough cleaning job that floss does. Earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-smart-dental-floss-can-detect-your-stress-from-saliva"&gt;research showed&lt;/a&gt; that floss could also be adapted to measure stress levels in the body, potentially giving doctors another useful diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as being potentially less scary for those with a phobia of needles, floss-based vaccines would be easier to transport and store. Doctors and nurses wouldn't be needed to administer them, and they could even be delivered in the post – a real advantage in the case of pandemics &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-why-some-covid-19-strains-are-spreading-faster-than-others"&gt;such as COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have previously tried to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.03.017"&gt;deliver vaccines orally&lt;/a&gt; under the tongue and in the cheek, but not enough of the vaccine penetrates the tissue into circulation. While there's still a lot of work to do with this new approach, the potential is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to drawbacks associated with injectable vaccines, such as pain and needle phobia, potential transmission of blood-borne pathogens from unsafe injection practices and the limited activation of mucosal immunity, there is a need for alternative approaches for vaccine delivery," &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41551-025-01451-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But if you’re munching on the wrong stuff every day, you could be stressing them out big time without even realizing it. Kidney health isn’t just about avoiding alcohol or salty snacks once in a while — it’s about what’s quietly adding up on your plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some everyday favorites might be silently working against your kidney function. The scary part? You don’t need to have kidney disease for damage to start. In fact, your kidneys can be under pressure long before any symptoms show up. So if you’re serious about preventing kidney damage or just want to be more mindful of your diet, here are the worst offenders hiding in plain sight — and what to eat instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salty processed &amp;amp; packaged foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt is public enemy #1 when it comes to kidney health.

Why? Too much sodium makes your kidneys retain water, raises your blood pressure, and speeds up kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skip those “convenience” and restaurant meals when you can.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always eyeball the nutrition facts label—the lower the sodium, the better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experiment with herbs, lemon, or vinegar for flavor.

Too much phosphorus ends up damaging blood vessels and bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprise sources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark colas and some flavored waters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sweetened iced teas and energy drinks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose plain water or unsweetened alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you must have a soda, switch to clear, caffeine-free versions now and then.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fast food &amp;amp; packaged dinners&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one stings, right? Burgers, fries, pizza, and instant noodles are the trifecta of trouble: loaded with sodium, saturated fat, and often sky-high in both phosphorus and potassium (another mineral that can pile up in your blood if kidneys aren’t healthy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to do:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit fast food outings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you do indulge, ask for food with “no added salt” and avoid extra cheese or sauces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High-phosphorus foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phosphorus is an unsung villain for kidneys—if your body can’t clear it, it’ll steal calcium from your bones and tangle with your heart health. High-phosphorus foods aren’t just colas, but also:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Processed cheese and dairy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans, nuts, whole grain breads, and many &lt;keyword id="20490015" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="processed-foods" source="keywords"&gt;processed foods&lt;/keyword&gt; with “phos-” on the ingredient list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High-protein animal foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat-lovers, beware: eating tons of red meat, poultry, eggs, and cheese loads your body with protein that your kidneys need to filter out. Over time, excess protein makes kidneys work overtime, which is rough if you already have kidney risk factors or early CKD. Yes, you need protein, but not more than your body can use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potassium bombs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, potassium is awesome! But when the kidneys are struggling, they can’t balance it, leading to muscle and heart problems. Foods like bananas, oranges, potatoes, tomatoes, avocados, and even some “whole wheat” breads are sneaky sources of potassium that could tip the scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything that’s boxed, bagged, or “ready in minutes” probably contains a cocktail of sodium, phosphorus, unhealthy fats, and advanced glycation end products (AGEs)—chemicals formed during high-temperature cooking and linked to kidney damage in multiple studies. The more ultra-processed foods you eat, the higher your risk for kidney trouble—even if you’re otherwise healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in American men, second only to skin cancer. And yet, myths and misunderstandings still cloud how we talk about it, test for it, and treat it. From the idea that it only affects "older guys" to the belief that early signs of prostate cancer always come with obvious symptoms (spoiler: they usually don’t), misinformation can be dangerous. Worse, it often leads to delays in diagnosis and prostate cancer treatment—and time matters when dealing with any cancer. Whether you're in your 40s or your 70s, knowing the facts about prostate health is just smart self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Prostate Cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer starts in the prostate gland, a small, walnut-sized part of the male reproductive system that sits just below the bladder. But sometimes, the cells in the prostate start growing out of control. That’s when cancer kicks in. The tricky part is that prostate cancer symptoms often don’t show up early. Most guys feel totally fine, no pain, no warning signs, nothing. That’s why regular prostate cancer screening, including PSA tests and yes, the digital rectal exam, matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In many cases, prostate cancer is highly treatable, especially when caught early. But if left undetected, it can spread to bones, lymph nodes, and other areas. That’s why keeping tabs on your prostate health, especially after age 50, is a game-changer. Think of it as part of long-term men’s cancer awareness—your future self will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prostate Cancer Guide: Expert Reveals Causes and Prevention Strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If I don’t have symptoms, I don’t have prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, wish it were true! The sneaky thing about prostate cancer is that in the early stages, it usually has no symptoms at all. Nope, not even a twinge or a peep. When symptoms like trouble peeing or back pain do pop up, it usually means the cancer has already advanced. That’s why screening and talking to your doc (even when you feel perfectly fine) is so important, especially if you’re over 50, African-American, or have a family history of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Only old men get prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, risk increases as you get older—most cases happen in men over 65. But younger men can and do get prostate cancer, sometimes even in their forties or fifties. Bottom line: age is a big risk factor, but it’s not a guarantee. No matter your age, be aware of your personal risk and talk it over with your health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If my dad had it, I’m doomed.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a father (or brother) with prostate cancer definitely bumps up your risk—about double, in fact. But it’s not destiny; plenty of men with a strong family history never get prostate cancer. And on the flip side, about 90% of prostate cancers pop up in men with no family history at all. Your family history is important to know, but it’s not a crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Screenings and PSA tests are pointless (or will always lead to unnecessary treatment).”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening is controversial, but it’s not pointless! The PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test can catch cancer before symptoms show up, but it’s not foolproof. Some cancers are slow, harmless guests; others need action, fast. If you have an elevated PSA, that’s just one piece of the puzzle, not an automatic cancer diagnosis or reason to rush into treatment. Decisions should always be personal, based on your age, health, and family history—and in conversation with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If I have prostate cancer, I need treatment right now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all prostate cancers are aggressive or dangerous. Some are so slow-growing that your doctor may recommend “active surveillance”—keep an eye on things with regular tests and only step in if the situation changes. For many men, avoiding or delaying treatment means fewer side effects, while still staying safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “Treatments always ruin your sex life and cause incontinence.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments can have side effects, including trouble with erections and urinary issues—you’ve probably heard this a lot. But not every guy who gets treated ends up with long-term problems. Side effects depend on many factors: your age, the specific treatment, and even the experience of your healthcare team. Plus, treatments and support to help manage side effects are better than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth: “If you don’t eat sugar or take special vitamins, you won’t get prostate cancer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s clear the air: eating sugar doesn’t cause prostate cancer, and there’s no magic diet or supplement that can prevent it. Obesity is linked to a higher risk of several cancers, including prostate, so eating healthy matters, but skipping sugar or popping vitamins won’t give you a get-out-of-cancer card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 01:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>即使没有更多的饮酒，重度饮酒者中也会出现严重的肝病-西雅图时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Serious liver disease is up among heavy drinkers, even without more drinking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lLaGRIbERoR21yN19scGtpZnF5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 01:02:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVnE4M0dKTWIyOXNlaXd4NzhueFlrSC1oa2YxclBlYjhCOUhnWGZKZGtjeFN5ZlkyU0hnMlVObVAtSDJDTHdxMmZOMjJBZUZmOFJFbkJaQ25uSDhjek9IcVJhLUJPMVFzRzEwNUNnOW5zakNucFdOcTRNTDZzLVJXTjdaRUpXSXlQOEJmM09tYm16d1R6VFZ6aEZCdzZaOWFIMHY3aEk4dW00Mk9QQlZlVkd5Z1dGOWxXQ0E</guid></item><item><title>女儿透露，在假期中从小狗身上死于狂犬病的英国母亲“可怕”死亡-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The daughter of a British woman who died of rabies after she was &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-14827919/British-mother-killed-rabies-video-dancing-stray-dog-Morocco.html"&gt;scratched by a puppy&lt;/a&gt; on holiday has spoken of her mother's 'horrendous' death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yvonne Ford, 59, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was scratched on the leg by a small stray puppy lying under her sunbed while on holiday in Morocco with her husband in February - but thought nothing of it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many months later, the grandmother-of-four started suffering from a 'horrendous' headache and was admitted to Barnsley Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within days, she could not walk, talk, sleep or swallow. She started hallucinating, and developed a fear of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yvonne was transferred to Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield where she was eventually diagnosed with the rare but devastating virus. She died on June 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her daughter Robyn Thomson, 32, has spoken of how the deathly disease that stole her mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neonatal nurse Robyn said: '[Mum] was the most loving person imaginable.

She was scratched in February - and died four months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'She and dad were on a holiday in Morocco and they were on a private beach next to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was a puppy underneath mum's sunbed and it scratched her leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was no blood and no evidence of the dog being unwell.

We went to Florida as a family and she went fishing with my dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But in June she came down with this horrendous headache.

She was hallucinating and had a fear of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She couldn't swallow. She was choking on her own saliva. So doctors put her in an induced coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't until over a week later that she was diagnosed with rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's only one outcome for rabies once symptoms develop and it's death every time. So we had to turn off her life support.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family later found out that it normally takes a few months for rabies symptoms to show - but the deadly disease can incubate for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Robyn wants to spread awareness for rabies - and help stop it at the source via a charity mission in Cambodia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-two has launched a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-mum-fighting-rabies-in-cambodia"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; and is appealing for help from the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'This is something I need to do. If I can save even one life through this work, or spare one family from going through the pain we have experienced, then it will be turning a terrible negative into something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm determined to transform my grief into action - helping vaccinate dogs, support surveillance efforts, and deliver life-saving lessons in schools.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 00:29:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPTG1oV2hyMWMwdm1uWGZ4dkxvaXVPeFBrdXBRVzd4OWRiSWxiTklFZDg5eDdnb1VMNlpKX3VRSF9YTkFaTUV6OFJ2cS1xMG9xZXNWbHMtZnlWNlFTOHFKSHhfc2xUcWFvVldMVmVHc2ctclhXSFZDOGhnd3JHbW9xd1h5SV9pOHJEaW1Fa3p3YUJGOHhOYkJWMWFBLXdKaXNRQWdsWUNkTUZoNEdYQk5rODJB0gG3AUFVX3lxTE40djBKTndSLU9kTGtZRXlyWTc5NElrWjR4OTNfaU1Sa28wdEwyM2RWMzFiR3RERDk1dVljVmVlQmVtQ3VNWHQwZzNpRHI3cl95akxIaFhkeEZNaTNyOGYyZUhIZEpfYm5mOEdmcTd1S2VwQ0hRdWlzQ0R5MWYybnE2WXd5UUZoWUl6VkcxbHNTT2piMFNxalEwQlV2RFdEQVEzRUd5cWNUdW8wOWE5d2dFQUlJRS0zQQ</guid></item><item><title>Serious OT: mods please leave. - 247Sports</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Serious OT: mods please leave.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;247Sports&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>247Sports</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 23:05:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOS1R6VkN5VnFaZXRybnU1SnNBX2pXSkNCVENfcktwd1h1OEdhZjJuVVk5T2FQMWtpTXl3OU8tOFNCZGRpTGZGUnVWZ2FkM0MwMnFPQnFnemh5cnZuZko5bVpMeE8tZ3NwMGd0bE5xeU9fQU1GeWdlNVFwVV83ZldnT2NCeDMyalI2VFJnZG1uTVZsN3EzTVNhLTI3cndjUExTWVp3bHp3</guid></item><item><title>如果您喜欢Trader Joe's ，您一定会喜欢这个消息！ - 92.7 WOBM</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5Pa2YtVFZzZTVfZXBkc2ltYWFhUEZvaFVKejg5Rm5lUDZLaTNPNlp5aUtxRVVxTTRkcTlaYWN5a3p3UUJ2ZDkwOHVuUW0yd2tUTkptY1VrZFY1cm1NZnJF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pod-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a few go-to favorites from Trader Joe's, and they almost always end up in our cart during one of our hauls.

An estimated 60,000 to 100,000 Americans die from blood clot complications annually, making this an important health issue to be aware of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Awareness of blood clot symptoms is critically important because early recognition can be life-saving,” says&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/jonathan-parsons-md-4884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Jonathan Parsons, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Jonathan Parsons, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a pulmonologist at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Recognizing symptoms early allows for prompt medical treatment.” That can help lower the risk of permanent damage to organs or tissues, he points out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here’s the problem: Not all symptoms of blood clots are obvious, and one in particular can be easily mistaken for other, much less severe health issues. Here’s what doctors want you to keep in mind about this symptom, why it can be confused with other things and when to take action. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/stethoscope" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🩺;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;🩺&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/pill" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:💊;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;💊&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do Serious Blood Clots Happen?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we go over the symptom, it’s important to first go over how blood clots can become serious. Blood clots that happen spontaneously usually start in the legs, explains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-e-yi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Christopher Yi, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Christopher Yi, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a vascular surgeon at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California. “They aren’t life-threatening in themselves, but they occasionally dislodge and go to the lungs,” he says. This is called a pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-a1c-levels-according-to-endocrinologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Got High A1C Levels? Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Got High A1C Levels? Stop Doing This One Thing ASAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot gets stuck in an artery in the lung and blocks blood flow to part of the lung, Dr. Yi explains. There, it can cause permanent damage to the lungs, low oxygen levels in your blood, and damage to other organs in your body (from not getting enough oxygen), he says, adding, “This can be life-threatening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Silent Sign of Blood Clots To Know About, According to a Vascular Surgeon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to that silent symptom: Shortness of breath is common with pulmonary embolisms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Shortness of breath is a hallmark symptom of pulmonary embolism because of how the condition affects the lungs and oxygen delivery,” Dr. Parson says. “The blocked artery prevents blood from reaching parts of the lung, so oxygen can't be absorbed into the bloodstream efficiently, resulting in shortness of breath.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This blockage usually comes on suddenly, so the body doesn’t have time to compensate for the lower-than-usual oxygen, he explains. That can lead to sudden and intense shortness of breath. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-packaged-foods-for-heart-health-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'I'm a Cardiologist, and These Are the 2 Packaged Snacks I Swear By for Heart Health';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;'I'm a Cardiologist, and These Are the 2 Packaged Snacks I Swear By for Heart Health'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When Shortness of Breath Is a Sign of a Blood Clot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortness of breath can also be a sign of a slew of other things, including being out of shape, having asthma or just having a cold, making this a tricky thing to pin on a blood clot. But doctors say there are a few key differences between “regular” shortness of breath and feeling breathless due to a blood clot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Standard shortness of breath usually comes with exercise or activity,” Dr. Yi says. “With a blood clot, there is a sudden onset of shortness of breath where you feel like you can’t catch your breath.” You may also start breathing faster than usual, he explains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along with coming on hard and fast, shortness of breath from a blood clot tends to get worse with exertion or taking deep breaths, according to Dr. Parson.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1264350/jenniferlarson/what-does-an-asthma-attack-feel-like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:‘An Elephant on Your Chest’ and ‘Being Trapped Under a Heavy Piece of Furniture’—Here’s What an Asthma Attack Actually Feels Like;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;‘An Elephant on Your Chest’ and ‘Being Trapped Under a Heavy Piece of Furniture’—Here’s What an Asthma Attack Actually Feels Like&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Signs of a Blood Clot and What To Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sudden shortness of breath alone should raise concerns about a possible pulmonary embolism, there are other blood clot symptoms doctors warn should be on your radar:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast breathing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chest pain (it usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A faster-than-usual heart rate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coughing, including coughing up blood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very low blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling lightheaded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tempting to write these signs off if you have one or two that can be explained away as something more minor. But doctors stress the importance of taking these seriously if you or someone around you has them. “If someone experiences these symptoms, immediate medical attention is critical,” Dr. Parsons says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/everyday-activity-thats-good-for-your-core-according-to-trainers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Trainers Say This Everyday Activity Is Secretly Amazing for Your Core;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Related: Trainers Say This Everyday Activity Is Secretly Amazing for Your Core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Silent Symptom That Could Be a Sign of Blood Clots&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on Parade on Jul 27, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally reported by &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/silent-blood-clot-symptom-according-to-vascular-surgeon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt; on Jul 27, 2025, where it first appeared.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 27 Jul 2025 20:48:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBLU0tUeUp5MHZ0M2JORXdxek5FdjFtN2dUSk1KRjJKUHFhMkRJd2NWTnNJTVNGQWw5bUEwQ1B5U3Fnbjk0bHlOY1A1QWEtMHo1X083MVFJeTNtbV9hMGlCYUpfa1NVcUJpSHFLaFVXLWQ5SEpq</guid></item><item><title>人类大脑在疫情中迅速老化，不仅仅是病毒- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUk9GX1BCemxQY2NhTWJyb3g3Ykh4ZDlFQ1pQeFNQSWltSE5hV3ZQckRpSHJud2tpUmp6STZoRjhDWE5UbkZLR2JlcUZYVlQ0LTFPWndLMjd6S1RPdFVFbFVidDd2cUNDVlpLRldFUXd0UGE0bTl6cTU0eXpIM1pWN0xwYlRxTW96UlVDYk5IVzEwRko4TDhGekJnSUpGYnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic may have left a significant mark on our brains, even if we didn't get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-covid-looks-scarily-like-old-age-in-the-human-brain-study-finds"&gt;Fatal cases&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 look scarily like old age &lt;/span&gt;in the brain&lt;span&gt;, and now, new research suggests that the mental, social, and financial stresses of the pandemic may have aged our brains as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team led by researchers at the University of Nottingham trained an AI model to recognize healthy aging in the brain, using the data of more than 15,000 adults in the UK Biobank. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The algorithm was then used to analyze the brain ages of two groups: one that had brain scans taken before the pandemic and another that had brain scans taken both before and during the pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brains-youthfulness-or-lack-of-it-could-predict-how-long-you-live?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Brain's Youthfulness (or Lack of It) Could Predict How Long You Live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During the pandemic, the average human brain aged five and a half months faster than it did before 2020.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"What surprised me most was that even people who hadn't had COVID showed significant increases in brain aging rates," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; neurologist Ali-Reza Mohammadi-Nejad from Nottingham, who led the study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It really shows how much the experience of the pandemic itself, everything from isolation to uncertainty, may have affected our brain health."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news is that those changes may be reversible. The study only analyzed brain scans from two time points, which means that there may have been neurological recovery in the years that followed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Dorothee Auer from Nottingham.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's more, just because a person's brain may have aged at a faster rate during the pandemic, doesn't mean their cognitive function was necessarily impacted. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, the only individuals in the study who showed decreased cognitive performance were those who were directly infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Still, the findings suggest that a major life event like a pandemic can have a significant impact on the brain, even if you don't get sick.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the first few years of the global pandemic, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/05/05/who-nearly-15-million-died-as-a-result-of-covid-19-in-first-two-years-of-pandemic/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;millions of humans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; died, and billions more dealt with a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/more-than-death-covid-has-unleashed-a-tidal-wave-of-grief-on-america"&gt;&lt;span&gt;tidal wave of grief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-okay-to-feel-lonely-right-now-here-s-how-to-recognise-the-symptoms"&gt;&lt;span&gt;loneliness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-03-2022-covid-19-pandemic-triggers-25-increase-in-prevalence-of-anxiety-and-depression-worldwide"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/feeling-stressed-before-you-get-covid-may-increase-your-odds-of-developing-long-covid"&gt;&lt;span&gt;anxiety&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic-depression-has-persisted-even-after-lockdowns-have-eased"&gt;&lt;span&gt;financial stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/covid-is-doing-something-to-our-sleep-and-even-to-our-dreams"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sleep disturbances&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initial research found teenagers were particularly affected by the global crisis, with the adolescent brain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lockdowns-did-something-to-teen-brains-and-we-need-to-talk-about-it"&gt;&lt;span&gt;showing concerning signs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of accelerated aging after 2020,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-brains-of-teenagers-look-disturbingly-different-after-lockdown"&gt;&lt;span&gt;similar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;span&gt; teens experiencing violence, neglect, or family dysfunction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168917" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168917" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans.jpg" alt="Corticol Thinning" class="size-full wp-image-168917" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/cortical-thinning-brain-scans-600x326.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168917" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans show accelerated brain maturation in teenagers following the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="168905" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="168905" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with more pronounced effects visible in female subjects.

But the current study among adults found that male brains were more vulnerable to both grey and white matter changes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs of accelerated aging were also particularly evident among older people and among socially or economically disadvantaged groups.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/social-isolation-actually-changes-our-brain-structure-neuroimaging-reveals"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that social isolation can change the structure of the brain, and poverty is also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/poverty-may-accelerate-brain-aging-study-shows"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to accelerated brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both could be factors leading to structural changes in the brain, but it's important to remain cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeping, long-term studies using brain scans can provide scientists with useful clues as to how major life events, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-scans-reveal-a-massive-surge-of-connectivity-when-babies-are-born"&gt;birth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/having-kids-linked-to-younger-looking-brains-later-in-life-study-finds"&gt;parenthood&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discovered-structural-brain-wide-changes-during-menstruation"&gt;menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, might be impacting our central nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But without closer research, it's impossible&lt;span&gt; to say why these brain regions are changing, or what impact the changes might have on cognitive function, or our behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This study reminds us that brain health is shaped not only by illness, but by our everyday environment," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/covid-19-brain-age"&gt;&lt;span&gt;concludes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;Auer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The pandemic put a strain on people's lives, especially those already facing disadvantage."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61033-4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
