Getting plenty of sleep. Staying hydrated and eating a balanced diet. Socializing with friends. Any number of these behaviors can be beneficial for your &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;. But as cliché as it sounds, it’s important to remember that laughter truly can be a powerful medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;And if you’re not convinced, perhaps our compilation below of posts from the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100044223829888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Mental Illness and Memes&lt;/a&gt; Facebook page will change your mind. We’ve gathered some of their silliest posts down below that anyone who’s in therapy might find painfully relatable. So enjoy scrolling through these memes, and keep reading to find conversations with psychotherapists Matt Teal, from &lt;a href="http://www.rochestercounseling.com/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"&gt;Rochester Counseling Group&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sonia-jaeger.com/en/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"&gt;Dr. Sonia Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;More info: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/mental_illness_and_memes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-items clearfix "&gt;  &lt;p class="desktop-in-content-ad post-ads "&gt; &lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt; &lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-3"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how a sense of humor can be beneficial for our &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/amusing-mental-health-memes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, we got in touch with a couple of experts who were kind enough to share their thoughts on the topic with &lt;strong&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Teal LCSW, CASAC, the practice director at &lt;a href="http://www.rochestercounseling.com/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"&gt;Rochester Counseling Group&lt;/a&gt; in Upstate, New York, says it’s absolutely healthy to try to find humor in our mental health struggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Laughter has been shown as a highly effective way to ‘complete the stress cycle’ in the human body,” Matt shared. “It releases tensions and negative thoughts, according to Dr. Emily and Amelia Nagoski.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-4"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think about the act of laughing, especially when it comes from the gut,” the therapist continued. “You are throwing your head back, exposing your throat, and closing your eyes. When you do this, the body associates the act with being safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also this phrase called the ‘knowing laugh,’” Matt noted. “It's when you share something that you think is quirky or unique to you and all of the sudden the room erupts because everyone else thought it was ‘just them’ who experienced that same thing. Here’s an &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-shy-introverts-memes-69/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also got in touch with psychologist, psychotherapist and digital nomad &lt;a href="https://www.sonia-jaeger.com/en/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"&gt;Dr. Sonia Jaeger&lt;/a&gt; to hear her thoughts on this topic. She agrees that humor can be a powerful coping tool when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/freakshow-of-madness-mental-health-memes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;. “While it shouldn't replace professional support or minimize real struggles, finding humor in our experiences can offer a sense of relief, validation, and connection,” the therapist shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memes, in particular, have a unique way of capturing complex emotions and experiences in a simple, often humorous format. They can make us feel less alone in our struggles and help us view our challenges from a different, sometimes more compassionate perspective,” Dr. Jaeger explained. “Laughing at a relatable meme can be a small but meaningful way to release tension and feel understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt believes memes can certainly be useful in therapy. “I use them to help clients understand their diagnosis, describe a symptom we are treating or even a skill they can use to manage symptoms,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've also had times where my clients, in trying to explain to me what they are going through, will say there is a meme they saw that relates to it,” the expert continued. “It sometimes even helped us get ‘unstuck’ with how to better verbalize and understand what the person is going through. And it started with sharing a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/gl9076/anyone_else_see_memes_and_think_itd_be_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaeger also says memes can definitely have a place in therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can act as a bridge for communication—especially for clients who find it difficult to articulate their feelings,” she told Bored Panda. “Instead of saying, ‘I don’t know how I feel,’ a client might share a meme that perfectly captures their emotional state. This can spark productive discussions and offer the therapist valuable insight into the client’s inner world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how to incorporate memes into therapy, Dr. Jaeger noted that there are several ways. “The therapist can bring in a selection of memes that touch on common mental health themes, letting clients choose ones that resonate with them,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the client can source memes as well. “Clients can bring memes they've found online that express how they’re feeling or what they’re going through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, therapists and their clients can work together to create memes. “This creative process can help externalize emotions and promote self-awareness in a non-threatening, humorous way,” Dr. Jaeger says. “When used thoughtfully, memes can help ease into difficult topics, build rapport, and encourage reflection in a way that feels approachable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-17"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also asked the experts why it’s so important for people to feel comfortable discussing their mental health struggles, even if they need memes to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘A unicycle, car or horse… All that matters is getting there.’ Memes have become part of our world's language and how we communicate,” Matt says. “Millennials and Gen Alphas have and will continue to use this artform as a way to relate and connect with one another. Forming connections and normalizing the human experience is essential for someone's mental health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, take someone who is feeling depressed and they see &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ridhigolechha/p/Cjn6SV0vMZj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;this meme&lt;/a&gt;,” Matt continued. “It is so funny and relatable that they decide to share it with a friend, loved one, or even their therapist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that feeling of sadness has also become a moment of connection, understanding and even laughter that is shared between people. The meme has become a conduit for that person to engage with their world where the moment before they may not have wanted to even be in it,” the therapist says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-20"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaeger noted that it’s essential for people to feel safe and comfortable discussing their mental health because silence often leads to isolation, misunderstanding, and shame. “When someone can’t find the words to explain what they’re experiencing, they might shut down—or worse, believe they’re the only one feeling that way,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-21"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memes can act as a first step toward opening up. They can normalize difficult feelings and remind people that others go through similar experiences,” she continued. “Sometimes, seeing a meme that ‘gets you’ can be more validating than hearing a clinical explanation. If it takes a meme to get someone talking about their anxiety, burnout, or ADHD symptoms, that’s still progress—and it’s incredibly valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memes create a sense of Common Humanity,” Matt added. “Common Humanity is a central tenet of Mindful Self Compassion as a therapeutic intervention. And anytime we can feel that, it has been shown to lower cortisol (the stress hormone) levels and increase feelings of self compassion (which is a naturally occurring analgesic to suffering).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using humor can help us reach people who might not ever otherwise share their feelings with others,” he shared. “Therapy does not need to be a mystical process. We can take the topic of mental health very seriously while also not taking ourselves so seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-26"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dr. Jaeger added, “Memes might seem lighthearted or even silly on the surface, but they can play a surprisingly meaningful role in mental health awareness and therapy. They speak the language of the internet generation—accessible, relatable, and often brutally honest. When used creatively and intentionally, they can help people feel seen, spark helpful conversations, and even encourage self-reflection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-27"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth keeping in mind that, while &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/hilarious-mental-health-memes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; can point to shared experiences or even help someone recognize a pattern in their behavior, they don’t tell the full story. “They’re not diagnostic tools, and sometimes what resonates might just be a piece of a much more complex puzzle,” Dr. Jaeger told Bored Panda. “Used alongside—not in place of—professional support, memes can absolutely enrich the therapeutic process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;                                                                                        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 23:02:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9wMVROMFM0a1AzdVhSSm5kZG1hRGN3aFI4Y0VyM2tJc0JHZGl3YjE4RThrZ2x0TTlwcDBsN0t5bTNMNjJZRHZVZTk5cFpJLTl3U3NZX2wwLVhiNTBxTy1vb245bU9SYzE4eDl5aUg1MWs</guid></item><item><title>服用维生素B有助于对抗青光眼，研究发现-每日邮报 | Taking vitamin B could help to fight glaucoma, study finds - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOb0tYUWJaLURjRFdXZjJtMFNJam5iLU9tRk9CRy1UYkNpeVpTSVU5Ym5ZOE9PUExhUzVqQndZYnQ3ay1HQ1NPQ1BzcVhDcWZtSnpYR1Ytc05QX3VndU1tZWtIVk5RNUViNmNwcnh2TjlXeVEtM1E5Z2NOOFZpemRzWWRpZGdGN2tLNXV6ZjhyTS1EY0pOUVpJOGp0VkZyYm5ieFpQaEZB0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBTYnlsdHI4bk9OZndEQjVaR1hsbjhST2tHaFRvZ0JhdnlKdzBCcTdHRDNYRFI4WWFaREhMX2x6NVZOSXAtY1lRVzRoeW9lSVZtV3lUWU5mMTRDckFRQlQxdkNMQUN2eHJZeDh3d29qcUFVT0VTNUk5SkcwSWlOU3VENW8yM2ZJWmtNZ2F5Qmw5bDg4bXhHOUNzWmxJY3dfYzZvWUFYWFllcWhxNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — It's long been a goal in medicine to better understand the long trajectories of diseases in hopes of engaging in better prevention and early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Collectively, they're (chronic and progressive diseases) responsible for about 90% of the health care costs in this country and the vast majority of morbidity and mortality," said Nina de Lacy, a professor of psychiatry and member of the One-U Responsible AI Initiative's executive committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, University of Utah researchers have taken a crucial step in doing so, unveiling a new, open-source software tool kit that uses artificial intelligence to predict whether individuals will develop progressive and chronic diseases years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter RiskPath, a new technology that analyzes patterns in health data collected over multiple years to identify at-risk individuals with "unprecedented accuracy" of 85% to 99%, according to National Institute of Mental Health-sponsored research published last week by the U.'s Department of Psychiatry and Huntsman Mental Health Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program harnesses explainable AI, which is designed to explain complex decisions in ways humans can understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Explainability means, can I explain enough about how AI accomplished this prediction such that it becomes understandable to humans?" de Lacy said. "That would be things like what RiskPath does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Lacy explained something that has always been a challenge in biomedicine is building models and analyzing longitudinal data, meaning it's collected over many time periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the major use cases in using longitudinal data is course development, understanding how people grow up and develop over time," de Lacy said. "And one of the other ones is what RiskPath is aimed at, which is understanding progressive or chronic disease. There are many progressive and chronic diseases out there, and some of the big ones are things that are the major diseases that affect humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research shows current medical prediction systems for longitudinal data often miss the mark, correctly identifying at-risk patients only about half to three-quarters of the time. Unlike existing prediction systems for longitudinal data, RiskPath uses advanced time-series AI algorithms that deliver crucial insights into how risk factors interact and change in importance throughout the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By identifying high-risk individuals before symptoms appear or early in the disease course and pinpointing which risk factors matter most at different life stages, we can develop more targeted and effective preventive strategies. Preventative health care is perhaps the most important aspect of health care right now, rather than only treating issues after they materialize," de Lacy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Lacy and the rest of the research team validated RiskPath across three major long-term patient cohorts involving thousands of participants to successfully predict eight different conditions, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, hypertension and metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology offers several key advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced understanding of disease progression:&lt;/strong&gt; RiskPath can map how different risk factors change in importance over time, revealing critical windows for intervention. For example, the study showed how screen time and executive function become increasingly important risk contributors for ADHD as children approach adolescence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined risk assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Though RiskPath can analyze hundreds of health variables, researchers found that most conditions can be predicted with similar accuracy using just 10 key factors, making implementation more feasible in clinical settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical risk visualization:&lt;/strong&gt; The system provides intuitive visualizations showing which time periods in a person's life contribute most to disease risk, helping researchers identify optimal times for preventive interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While RiskPath is primarily a research tool to help researchers build better risk stratification models, de Lacy hopes it will eventually be used in a health care setting to improve disease management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some may be using that to build models that can be implemented in health care, and we kind of hope that they do that. But ... a big part of what my lab is interested in doing is building tools that do a better job of risk stratification. We're very interested in prevention," de Lacy said. "The ultimate aim of RiskPath and tools like RiskPath is to help people build better risk stratification tools and decision support tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And what those do is help clinicians, and maybe one day patients, be able to understand their risk for a chronic or progressive disease better and earlier," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 21:04:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQdTlEWHBzVFJITmh2ZzNsUEVpU2hVRnIxX0xxOWtkNUdVYUk5aG1OUWJ1UF96N1lRQ1dxRVBIbWgzVzhaeHJOc2NEcDU1alN2T25oMjdJUW5JRnc3aUxHRmh4MjdqMlhvZFBhVWljQjVtdjIwWkJHdlpraDh3RDFlOW45V0hlMWhQRUVodC1hUFpiUmpFdEJDZEdySjFwWURneWtGZ3pvSTlCNEd3a1F6Y2ZqT19falFYTzhhelo5NmVrUQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，与ADHD成人认知表现缺陷相关的淋巴功能障碍- PsyPost | Glymphatic dysfunction linked to cognitive performance deficits in adults with ADHD, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxQbUw0VjczWnAxNEdIeFUweWJoVTd5emQ4WXZkNl9HejNYOW1zV0R5em1vRUgtMGxldlhkY3NNQU04YjhtcjlpTldna1k0T29BN0pFTHpUZm8ybFV5MmdJcHlsNVpTZVRJWml2Wk41YXpaSnowMDFoQVQyWXJzUGY3aV9odzEzRDF1cUlsaFE3TGtCemhiUVE3TXM2SElhVVJjWkhYMDRNRVFQU1ZkME5Sa3VET2lfOXFkcU9wbQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032725003970" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) show signs of glymphatic system dysfunction, which may be related to their cognitive difficulties. The findings suggest that disruptions in the brain’s waste clearance system could help explain some of the persistent memory and attention problems seen in adults with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder marked by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. While it is often diagnosed in childhood, many people continue to experience symptoms well into adulthood. In adults, ADHD can interfere with work, relationships, and daily functioning, and is often accompanied by cognitive issues such as forgetfulness and difficulty sustaining focus. Although behavioral symptoms are widely studied, the biological mechanisms that underlie adult ADHD are less understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area of growing interest among scientists is the glymphatic system—a network that helps clear waste products from the brain. This system operates mainly during deep sleep and uses cerebrospinal fluid to flush out harmful substances. Problems with glymphatic function have been linked to other brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, little is known about its role in ADHD, especially in adults. The researchers behind this study wanted to explore whether changes in glymphatic function could help explain the cognitive impairments associated with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the team analyzed brain imaging and cognitive data from 41 adults diagnosed with ADHD and compared them to 108 healthy adults. The data came from the University of California, Los Angeles Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomic LA5c Study and included both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, along with results from several cognitive tests. The researchers used advanced neuroimaging techniques to assess three indicators of glymphatic function: the volume of the choroid plexus (a part of the brain that produces cerebrospinal fluid), a measure known as the ALPS index (which reflects how well fluid moves along blood vessels in the brain), and the strength of the connection between brain activity and cerebrospinal fluid flow (called gBOLD-CSF coupling).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants also completed a range of assessments, including the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale to measure ADHD symptoms, and standardized tests to evaluate memory, attention, and verbal learning. These included the California Verbal Learning Test and the Wechsler Memory Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that adults with ADHD had lower ALPS index scores than healthy individuals, suggesting reduced glymphatic activity. This difference was observed across both hemispheres of the brain. The decrease in ALPS scores was linked to reduced fluid movement along specific fiber pathways in the brain, particularly those involved in communication between regions. These findings point to a possible impairment in how effectively the brain is able to clear waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the volume of the choroid plexus tended to be higher in the ADHD group, this difference did not reach statistical significance. This may suggest a potential compensatory response or a marker of altered cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, but more research is needed to draw firm conclusions. Likewise, there were no significant differences between the ADHD and control groups in terms of gBOLD-CSF coupling, which reflects functional synchronization between brain activity and fluid flow. This suggests that while structural glymphatic changes may be present, the overall coordination between brain and fluid activity remains intact in adults with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers found that lower ALPS index scores were associated with poorer performance on memory tasks, including visual reproduction and delayed recognition. These correlations were stronger in the right hemisphere. The ALPS index also showed links with higher scores on obsessive-compulsive symptoms in participants with ADHD, suggesting a broader relationship between glymphatic function and psychiatric features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy participants, higher ALPS scores were also associated with better memory performance, suggesting that glymphatic activity may play a broader role in supporting cognitive health across individuals, not just those with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings open up the possibility that glymphatic dysfunction contributes to the cognitive symptoms experienced by adults with ADHD. The researchers propose that impaired waste clearance could lead to the buildup of metabolic byproducts that interfere with brain signaling, particularly in pathways involving dopamine and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters are already known to play a role in attention, motivation, and reward processing—all areas often affected in ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation is that impaired glymphatic function may contribute to low-grade inflammation in the brain, which has been increasingly recognized in ADHD research. Inflammation can disrupt brain development and affect how neurons communicate. The researchers also point out that sleep problems, which are common in ADHD, may worsen glymphatic dysfunction, since this system operates most effectively during deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a cellular level, the authors suggest that astrocytes—supportive brain cells that help regulate the glymphatic system—may play an important role. Astrocytes help manage fluid flow through channels called aquaporins and also influence how brain circuits develop. Dysfunction in these cells could create a cascade of problems affecting both waste clearance and neural communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study is one of the first to examine glymphatic function in adult ADHD, it has several limitations. Because the data are cross-sectional, the researchers cannot determine whether glymphatic dysfunction causes cognitive problems or results from them. Longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the direction of this relationship. The relatively small sample size also limits the generalizability of the findings, and future research should aim to replicate these results in larger and more diverse groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study adds an important piece to the puzzle of ADHD. It suggests that biological systems beyond neurotransmitter signaling—such as waste clearance—may play a meaningful role in the disorder’s development and persistence. These insights could eventually lead to new therapeutic strategies. For example, improving sleep quality, promoting regular physical activity, or reducing brain inflammation could support glymphatic function and potentially ease cognitive symptoms in adults with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.059" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Glymphatic system dysfunction in adult ADHD: Relationship to cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yan Fang, Juan Peng, Tiantian Chu, Feng Gao, Fei Xiong, and Ye Tu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 20:09:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxQbUw0VjczWnAxNEdIeFUweWJoVTd5emQ4WXZkNl9HejNYOW1zV0R5em1vRUgtMGxldlhkY3NNQU04YjhtcjlpTldna1k0T29BN0pFTHpUZm8ybFV5MmdJcHlsNVpTZVRJWml2Wk41YXpaSnowMDFoQVQyWXJzUGY3aV9odzEzRDF1cUlsaFE3TGtCemhiUVE3TXM2SElhVVJjWkhYMDRNRVFQU1ZkME5Sa3VET2lfOXFkcU9wbQ</guid></item><item><title>您每天步行以降低癌症风险真正需要的步数—忘记旧的“10K”规则-纽约邮报 | The number of steps you really need to walk a day to lower cancer risk — forget that old ‘10K’ rule - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQWWpxdjFsaHBqS2Z4aTJzWGpiUzdPY3RfSmc3N0pKUFlUallPR1hna3ZxMzRhNWx6ZnN0U1VTRVNsMGJ1RHdZY2U4alp1d3pHVmoyV2p1SExCd003NHRudUpDT2QyNmlMNG5BLXVYUU0zWS1TS2w2dUtOaVB0UU41cTZyaHkzRkxvMFBJekI5dG5SR2h2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Every step counts when it comes to your health — but a &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/14/bjsports-2024-109360" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; suggests hitting a specific number every day could lower your risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And no, it’s not 10,000. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Turns out, that magic number we’ve all been chasing wasn’t discovered in a lab. It was actually dreamed up in the 1960s as a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/15/do-we-need-10k-steps-a-day-shocking-truth-of-daily-goal/"&gt;clever marketing tactic&lt;/a&gt; to sell pedometers in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Walking lowers cancer risk, but the benefits appear to plateau after a certain number of steps.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dragana Gordic – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the latest recommendations are backed by solid science from the UK.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large study followed over 85,000 participants who wore activity trackers measuring both the amount and intensity of their daily movement for an average of six years.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on 13 types of cancer and identified a clear trend: the more you move, the lower your risk. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the six-year follow-up period, 3% of participants developed cancer. The most common were &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/health/scientists-find-key-that-could-be-driving-rising-colon-cancer-rates/"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt;, rectal and lung in men, along with &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/20/health/alarming-rise-in-breast-cancer-under-40-across-the-us/"&gt;breast&lt;/a&gt;, colon, endometrial and lung in women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The study suggests it’s not the pace that matters — it’s how much you walk. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;nuttawutnuy – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The study found that people who walked 7,000 steps a day had an 11% lower cancer risk compared to those logging just 5,000.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At 9,000 steps, the risk dropped further to 16% — but beyond that, the benefits leveled off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results held steady even after researchers accounted for demographic, health and lifestyle factors, indicating that it was the steps themselves that made the difference. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Getting more steps into your routine, especially during middle age, could be one of the simplest ways to lower your risk of developing certain cancers,” &lt;a href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/schools/sport-exercise-health-sciences/people/mhairi-morris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Mhairi Morris&lt;/a&gt;, a senior lecturer in biochemistry at Loughborough University who wasn’t involved in the study, wrote in &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-7-000-steps-a-day-could-help-reduce-your-risk-of-cancer-255564" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Research consistently points to an increase in sedentary lifestyles among Americans. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;stokkete – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Not a fan of power walking? No problem. If you prefer a leisurely stroll, you’re still doing your body a favor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While researchers found a faster pace was linked to a lower cancer risk, once overall activity levels were factored in, speed didn’t really matter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants who traded sitting time for physical activity also saw a drop in cancer risk. However, increasing the intensity from light to moderate didn’t provide much additional benefit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our research highlights the importance of all forms of movement,” &lt;a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/team/aiden-doherty"&gt;Dr. Aiden Doherty&lt;/a&gt;, professor of biomedical informatics at &lt;a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oxford Population Health&lt;/a&gt; and senior author of the study, said in &lt;a href="https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/news/daily-physical-activity-even-at-light-intensities-linked-to-lower-cancer-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Whether it’s increasing daily steps, engaging in light activity, or incorporating moderate-to-vigorous exercise, any level of physical activity appears to contribute to lower cancer risk,” he continued. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Over 2 million new cancer cases are expected in the US this year. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Halfpoint – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This study comes at a time when many common cancers, like breast, kidney, colorectal and uterine cancers, are on the rise in the US. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the increase is multifactorial, experts point to rising &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/03/health/more-than-half-of-adults-are-expected-to-be-overweight-or-obese-by-2050/"&gt;obesity rates&lt;/a&gt; and an increasingly &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/11/health/this-lifestyle-habit-is-as-risky-to-your-health-as-smoking/"&gt;sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; as major drivers of the growing cancer risk — particularly among &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/18/health/what-to-know-about-rising-cancer-rates-in-young-people/"&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the country, more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/adult-obesity-facts/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2 in 5 adults&lt;/a&gt; have obesity, along with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood-obesity-facts/childhood-obesity-facts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1 in 5 children and adolescents&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/physical-activity-guidelines/current-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Department of Health and Human Services recommends&lt;/a&gt; adults get at least &lt;a href="https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;150 minutes&lt;/a&gt; of moderate aerobic exercise each week, plus muscle-strengthening activities like weightlifting at least twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7204a1.htm?s_cid=mm7204a1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, more than two-thirds of Americans aren’t hitting those benchmarks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our findings support and enhance current national and international physical activity guidelines, showing that people who often engage in simple low-intensity activities such as walking have a lower risk of developing cancer,” Doherty said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2025/2025-cancer-facts-and-figures-acs.pdf"&gt; American Cancer Society estimates&lt;/a&gt; that more than 2 million new cases will be diagnosed in the US in 2025, and more than 618,000 people will die from the disease. That’s roughly 1,700 cancer deaths every day nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising regularly is known to lower the risk of death, especially from heart problems. But scientists have discovered that that reduction in risk may differ between the sexes, with some people reaping greater benefits in less workout time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, who has to exercise more to reduce their risk of death: Women or men?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that women may reap these survival benefits more easily than men do. That's according to a large study published in 2024 in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.12.019" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2023.12.019" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which included data from more than 412,000 American adults ages 27 to 61, 55% of whom were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The beauty of this study is learning that women can get more out of each minute of moderate to vigorous activity than men do," study co-lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Martha.Gulati" data-url="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Martha.Gulati" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Martha Gulati&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of preventive cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/women-get-the-same-exercise-benefits-as-men-but-with-less-effort/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/women-get-the-same-exercise-benefits-as-men-but-with-less-effort/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Compared to inactive individuals of the same sex, women who exercised regularly had up to a 24% lower risk of death from any cause. For men who exercised regularly, however, the reduction in mortality risk reached only 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women also gained these survival benefits much more quickly than men did, the study found. In men, the highest reduction in death risk was seen at about 300 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week. That came with an 18% reduction in all-cause mortality. Women saw an equal benefit in less than half that time, at about 140 minutes of MVPA a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who trained more than that each week saw a greater benefit until they also peaked at around 300 minutes of weekly MVPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That trend held true across all durations of exercise, the researchers found, with women consistently seeing "proportionately greater benefits" for any amount of exercise than men did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20% of women and 28% of men said they engaged in two or more sessions of strength training, such as lifting weights, each week. Overall, though, women reported an average of about 0.85 sessions per week, while men averaged 1.25 sessions per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, the women who strength-trained at least twice a week had a 19% lower mortality risk than women who trained less often or not at all. Men, on average, saw a 11% lower risk compared with inactive men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits were even greater when it came to cardiovascular health specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/exercise/why-is-it-harder-for-some-people-to-build-muscle-than-others" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/exercise/why-is-it-harder-for-some-people-to-build-muscle-than-others"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is it harder for some people to build muscle than others?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with inactive individuals, women who performed aerobic physical activity had a 36% lower cardiovascular mortality risk, while for active men, this risk reduction was about 14%. Muscle strengthening produced similar outcomes, with a cardiovascular risk reduction of 30% for women and 11% for men, compared to baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What surprised us the most was the fact that women who do muscle strengthening had a reduction in their cardiovascular mortality by 30%," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/11/1236791784/strength-resistance-weight-training-longevity-aging-heart-disease" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/11/1236791784/strength-resistance-weight-training-longevity-aging-heart-disease" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gulati told NPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "We don't have many things that reduce mortality in that way," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did have some limitations, including that people's exercise data was self-reported, so it relied on the participants accurately reporting their activity levels.The study also tracked only leisure-time exercise, meaning it didn't count exercise completed during household tasks or as part of a job, which may have also contributed to the results. In addition, the study didn't account for potentially unassessed health issues in some participants, or changes in people's exercise trends over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the results echo similar findings from a 2011 meta-analysis published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.010710" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.110.010710" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Circulation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;This review of 33 studies concluded that there was a stronger link between exercise and lower death risk in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the 2024 study hope their findings could help motivate more women to exercise, whether through traditional "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-does-cardio-do-to-your-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-does-cardio-do-to-your-body"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cardio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" or muscle strengthening regimes including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/bodyweight-exercises-without-equipment" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/bodyweight-exercises-without-equipment"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bodyweight exercises&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am hopeful that this pioneering research will motivate women who are not currently engaged in regular physical activity to understand that they are in a position to gain tremendous benefit for each increment of regular exercise they are able to invest in their longer-term health," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Christine.Albert?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D23607495020614261753066950317791887461%7CMCORGID%3DF47CD0AC591352EC0A495E82%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1747169522&amp;amp;adobe_mc=MCMID%3D23607495020614261753066950317791887461%7CMCORGID%3DF47CD0AC591352EC0A495E82%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1747169534" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchers.cedars-sinai.edu/Christine.Albert?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D23607495020614261753066950317791887461%7CMCORGID%3DF47CD0AC591352EC0A495E82%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1747169522&amp;amp;adobe_mc=MCMID%3D23607495020614261753066950317791887461%7CMCORGID%3DF47CD0AC591352EC0A495E82%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1747169534" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Christine Albert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Department of Cardiology in the Smidt Heart Institute who was not involved in the study, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-N4XEYEtRm6XVSbi4VufaKV-7lkHBUcyBLsyA5zGLUPf8tDbQOiX8W3l" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-N4XEYEtRm6XVSbi4VufaKV-7lkHBUcyBLsyA5zGLUPf8tDbQOiX8W3l slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or fitness advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Higher levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein were associated with reduced activity in brain regions involved in reward and motivation, such as the ventral striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brain changes were specifically linked to negative symptoms like difficulty initiating work or social relationships, rather than to hallucinations or delusions. The findings lay the groundwork for precision medicine trials targeting inflammation in this subgroup of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammation-Motivation Link:&lt;/strong&gt; High C-reactive protein levels correlate with motivational deficits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Circuit Impacted:&lt;/strong&gt; Inflammation disrupts reward-related activity in the ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Treatment Trial:&lt;/strong&gt; Infliximab is being tested for patients with both high inflammation and negative symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Emory University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Emory University has identified a biological connection between inflammation and deficits in motivation in individuals with schizophrenia, offering new hope for treating symptoms that have long been resistant to existing therapies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in Neuropsychopharmacology, the official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology, the study found that higher levels of C-reactive protein — a blood biomarker of inflammation produced by the liver — were associated with reduced activity in brain circuits tied to reward and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110079"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man holding his head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/inflammation-motivation-schizophrenia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;For example, previous studies of medications targeting inflammation in patients with schizophrenia have largely failed by not identifying which patients would benefit from these approaches. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brain changes, in turn, were linked to negative symptoms of schizophrenia specific to motivational deficits, such as difficulties in finding work, relationships or school. The inflammation was not associated with other schizophrenia symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are significant because current antipsychotic medications do not address these motivational deficits and, in some cases, may even worsen them. These symptoms are also strongly associated with poor functional outcomes in patients with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on a key brain circuit involving the ventral striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex — areas previously shown to be sensitive to inflammation in studies of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first study in schizophrenia to link inflammation with both brain changes in reward circuits and specific motivational symptoms,” says David Goldsmith, MD, associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying a biological mechanism underlying these symptoms, we are closer to developing targeted treatments that could offer real relief to patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study supports a precision medicine approach by suggesting treatments targeting inflammation may only benefit a specific group of patients — those with elevated inflammatory markers and significant motivational challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, previous studies of medications targeting inflammation in patients with schizophrenia have largely failed by not identifying which patients would benefit from these approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work helped lay the foundation for a current experimental-medicine trial at Emory testing the anti-inflammatory drug infliximab, commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, in patients with schizophrenia who have high inflammation and motivational deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study of infliximab in this patient population and designed to test whether the impact of inflammation on this circuit and these symptoms may be causal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an urgent need to develop new strategies to treat the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which remains one of the greatest unmet needs in the field,” says Goldsmith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this line of research will change that. If we want to support recovery from schizophrenia, we must be able to treat these symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health through a K23 Career Development Award (K23MH114037) totaling $957,420 over five years, as well as KL2TR002381 and UL1TR002378.

Of these symptoms, deficits in motivation and pleasure, especially in the domain of avolition, are particularly disabling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effects of inflammation on motivational deficits in patients with depression are associated with disruptions in corticostriatal reward circuitry involving the inferior ventral striatum (iVS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, we examined the relationships among inflammation, negative symptoms, and corticostriatal reward circuitry in patients with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative symptoms and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were obtained in 57 individuals with schizophrenia. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) was obtained from a subset of 43 of these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations were tested between hsCRP and the motivation and pleasure (MAP) and expressivity (EXP) dimensions of the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) as well as targeted rsFC between iVS and vmPFC. Covariates in all statistical models included age, sex, race, smoking, body mass index, depression, and chlorpromazine equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hsCRP was significantly associated with BNSS MAP (β = 0.34, p&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.022, specifically the domains of avolition and asociality (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), but not BNSS EXP (β = −0.17, p&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.57) or the domains of blunted affect or alogia (both &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). hsCRP was also significantly associated with decreased rsFC from right iVS to vmPFC (β=−0.37, p&lt;sub&gt;corr&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.029), which in turn, was associated with increased avolition in individuals with higher (hsCRP &amp;gt;2 mg/L) but not lower inflammation (β=−14.01, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007 vs. β = 0.07, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.77, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hsCRP was associated with reduced avolition and corticostriatal rsFC in patients with schizophrenia and increased inflammation, underscoring the need for further research to replicate these associations with brain connectivity changes in this subgroup of individuals with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 15:59:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5tYkVNbVdBeDlFV3VjWnNUbjdmYlRLcjB2X2NsX25RLVIyTTNBbXRmM2MtSnFIc3IxSERvTkdrajRLSTk4ODZfeUdkckFpTjlSZ1pRX0ZCQXZLRHd0Y2ZLRi1ENFRaYjZGbVAzdi1JTmFiLVlPU2JQZlVwSTVYUQ</guid></item><item><title>FDA批准首次验血以诊断阿尔茨海默氏症- Axios | FDA clears first blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ScHhDSVQtX0NXdjZKaFJtQlhZNTlSTGZwbVRWWU1ZRno5cmlETE1kb2VnMHRqS1FEUlFmVGo5UkVuSjlpUE9rb3BQRWl2MUlkTkZueEFDVmppUnBGOGhuaTJUX3lOREhvaGZSYThKbDRLTEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 15:48:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ScHhDSVQtX0NXdjZKaFJtQlhZNTlSTGZwbVRWWU1ZRno5cmlETE1kb2VnMHRqS1FEUlFmVGo5UkVuSjlpUE9rb3BQRWl2MUlkTkZueEFDVmppUnBGOGhuaTJUX3lOREhvaGZSYThKbDRLTEE</guid></item><item><title>你的大脑喜欢深呼吸，科学解释了原因-神经科学新闻 | Your Brain Loves Deep Breathing, Science Explains Why - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1LQzJmeVhrN2NiNVhlaHo1Q1pkQlBaUWw1TXhIN2x4U1JINkh2SkJsSk9lOFFTYUhmTjZEWjZDdE9JMnlTSTlqMC1OR0xYYWxId0lpNDJIR2ZJNEV5ZU9lZ0FidGl4di1RTFVJN3BCQTB4QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Breathwork, or the practice of intentionally controlling one’s breathing, has been shown to calm brain activity, reduce anxiety, and even ease symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep, slow breathing engages neural circuits that regulate emotional states, producing a measurable calming effect. This process is rooted in biology, not belief—animal studies show that consistent slow breathing reduces fear responses, confirming the effect isn’t just placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple techniques like box breathing and 4-7-8 breathing can offer benefits in as little as five minutes. While intense breathwork methods can cause altered states, most people benefit from basic breathing exercises. Breathwork offers a powerful, accessible tool for managing stress and enhancing mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurobiological Basis:&lt;/strong&gt; Breathwork activates calming signals across brain circuits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proven in Animals:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice trained to breathe slowly showed reduced fear responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Is Effective:&lt;/strong&gt; Techniques like box breathing can lower stress in just minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathwork – intentionally changing breathing patterns to improve physical, mental or emotional well-being – may seem woo-woo, but the science behind the practice is sound, says Jack Feldman, PhD, a professor of neurobiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Feldman discussed how breathing affects the brain in a conversation with Tyrone Lindqvist, lead singer of the Australian electronic dance trio Rufus Du Sol, on a recent episode of the “Sing for Science” podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110075"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/deep-beating-calmness-neurosicnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/deep-beating-calmness-neurosicnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/deep-beating-calmness-neurosicnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/deep-beating-calmness-neurosicnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/deep-beating-calmness-neurosicnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/deep-beating-calmness-neurosicnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/deep-beating-calmness-neurosicnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/deep-beating-calmness-neurosicnce.jpg" alt="This shows a person in the lotus position.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band has incorporated breathwork into its pre-performance ritual, Lindqvist said, and its new album, “Inhale/Exhale,” was partly inspired by the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Breathwork has felt like a big part of our last three years,” Lindqvist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Feldman has been studying breathing and the brain for more than 40 years. In 1986, he discovered and named the area in the brain responsible for generating and controlling breathing, known as the preBötzinger Complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, he and colleagues have investigated the effects of breathing rhythms and patterns on emotions, finding that slower breathing leads to a calmer mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that the survival of early mammals was improved by their ability to breathe slowly,” Dr. Feldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All mammals sigh, and we think under proper conditions they use their own form of breathwork in response to stressful situations. … It’s something we think that evolved early that we ultimately hijacked in terms of breathwork.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes breathwork work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Feldman started his research in this area probing what he thought was a simple question: What mechanisms in the brain allow it to create a reliable breathing pattern that persists throughout the lifespan and adapts to movement, speech and other activities instantly and without thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of inquiry has led him to publish more than 150 scientific papers to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer to why breathwork can have such profound effects on the body and mind is that there are signals related to breathing throughout the brain, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An intentionally deep breath affects those signals, resulting in a calming response. Breathing is also involved in the signaling pathway for depression, he said, adding that studies show that consistent breathwork practice can be effective in treating conditions such as anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one doesn’t need to understand how breath affects the brain to benefit from breathwork, Dr. Feldman said, “much like you can drive a car without understanding how an engine works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practicing common breathing techniques, such as box breathing or 4-7-8 breathing, for a few minutes a day is a great way to start, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Box breathing involves inhaling for four counts, holding for four, exhaling for four, and holding for four; 4-7-8 breathing refers to inhaling for four counts, holding for seven, and exhaling for eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Feldman said Navy SEALS are known to use box breathing and other breathwork techniques to calm themselves in highly stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Dr. Feldman’s recent work has investigated whether the placebo effect contributes to the efficacy of breathwork. In other words, do deep breaths calm us down because we expect them to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have a stressful situation, just sit down and take a few deep breaths, five minutes, and people will discover it’s restorative,” says Dr. Jack Feldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, he and his colleagues modified breathing rates in mice, causing them to breathe more slowly for 30 minutes a day over a period of four weeks. Tests afterward showed the mice were much less fearful than a control group whose breathing wasn’t slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s pretty amazing how much less fearful they were,” Dr. Feldman said. “The fact that we can see the effect of breathwork in mice really indicates that it’s … not all placebo components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hopes the study, which is awaiting publication, “will have a positive impact on individuals who think breathwork is one of these woo-woo things, that you have to believe in something in particular to make it work,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindqvist was introduced to breathwork by his father-in-law, who was interested in Wim Hof, a Dutch athlete who advocates an intense breathing technique of quick, deep breaths followed by holding the breath for as long as a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice can lead to lightheadedness and tingling sensations in the hands and feet. Hof claims it supports stress reduction and improves sleep. His website also indicates the technique can lead to loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lindqvist, the practice created a feeling of being “extremely present” that lasted for several hours, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People new to breathwork should start with something less intense, Dr. Feldman suggested: “Don’t go out and run a marathon when you’ve been sitting on the couch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wim Hof Method and a similar technique, Holotropic Breathwork, can lead to altered states of consciousness, which both Lindqvist and Dr. Feldman described as “psychedelic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This – and the tingling physical sensations – likely results from changes in carbon dioxide levels caused by hyperventilation, Dr. Feldman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon dioxide levels determine the pH, or acid base balance, of the blood, which has “a profound effect on the neurons in your brain as well as the rest of your body,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techniques such as the Wim Hof Method or Holotropic Breathwork can be invigorating, he said. But basic, slow breathing is all that’s needed for most people to experience the stress-reducing benefits of breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have a stressful situation, just sit down and take a few deep breaths, five minutes, and people will discover it’s restorative,” Dr. Feldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe not everyone, but a lot of people will find that to be beneficial, and to me, that’s amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this breathwork and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e5946617b7d7a61604e636b6a606b7a207b6d626f206b6a7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Will Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Will Houston – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 15:45:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1LQzJmeVhrN2NiNVhlaHo1Q1pkQlBaUWw1TXhIN2x4U1JINkh2SkJsSk9lOFFTYUhmTjZEWjZDdE9JMnlTSTlqMC1OR0xYYWxId0lpNDJIR2ZJNEV5ZU9lZ0FidGl4di1RTFVJN3BCQTB4QQ</guid></item><item><title>与阿尔茨海默氏症风险相关的中年皮质醇水平-神经科学新闻 | Midlife Cortisol Levels Linked to Alzheimer’s Risk - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE5UQ2tfY3FGMVZSeGx6MS1RMTQ0RmRGb1lyN0I0NDJOdmlmeWhab0YtSWNmTEhVUkxQT1Q1WFg4OEhIR2pPNmhBcTNtZGtBTmQtR2gxS1NmZjNFSFlZVk01Ykthc2RKa2hrY1ZQOFhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study finds that elevated cortisol levels in midlife are linked to increased brain amyloid deposition—a key marker of Alzheimer’s disease—specifically in post-menopausal women. Researchers tracked 305 cognitively healthy individuals over 15 years and discovered that high cortisol predicted amyloid buildup later in life, but only among women who had gone through menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that hormonal changes may amplify cortisol’s harmful effects on brain health.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing midlife cortisol levels at the beginning of a 15-year period with disease indicators at the end, the researchers were able to determine that those levels could serve as an Alzheimer’s disease biomarker, with particular attention to gender differences and menopausal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No significant associations were observed in males or with tau burden, referring to the tau protein that contributes to neuronal dysfunction and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The results highlight the importance of identifying early risk factors when biomarkers are detectable but cognitive impairment is absent,” said Arash Salardini, MD, associate professor of cognitive and behavioral neurology with the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salardini is first author of the study titled, “Elevated serum cortisol associated with early-detected increase of brain amyloid deposition in Alzheimer’s disease imaging biomarkers among menopausal women: The Framingham Heart Study,” published April 24 in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other authors also are with UT Health San Antonio, as well as the University of Texas School of Public Health San Antonio; Framingham Heart Study of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health; Boston University; Gonzaba Medical Group, San Antonio; University of Galway, Ireland; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School; New York University Grossman School of Medicine; Brigham and Women’s Hospital; Yale University; and the University of California at Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work shows that considering sex and hormonal status in understanding Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis is important, and suggests that stress reduction and hormonal interventions may hold promise for Alzheimer’s prevention, especially in at-risk women,” said Sudha Seshadri, founding director of the Biggs Institute and senior author of the study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting risk factors early&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study notes that “sporadic” Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of cognitive decline in older adults. That features a prolonged asymptomatic phase of amyloid beta accumulation, the main component of amyloid plaques, eventually triggering progressive cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognizing that these biological changes are already well established by the time symptoms emerge, effective early interventions must target Alzheimer’s disease risk factors during the preclinical stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite significant advancements in understanding how the disease affects the body’s normal biological processes, more than half of the overall risk has remained unexplained, underscoring the critical need to identify additional risk factors that can be targeted during the preclinical stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One promising line of investigation centers on cortisol, a steroid hormone essential for cellular homeostasis, or balance, and the stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic studies had identified mutations in glucocorticoid, or steroid hormones that have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, signaling pathways that increase susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies had reported that higher blood cortisol levels are linked to an increased likelihood of developing the disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To address gaps and inconsistencies across those studies, the researchers led by UT Health San Antonio conducted a longitudinal analysis using data from the third-generation cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, which dates to 1948 and now is directed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They assessed the relationship between serum cortisol levels in the 305 cognitively unimpaired, middle-aged individuals – 48.5% female, with a mean age of 39.6 years –and amyloid/tau burdens approximately 15 years later using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. And they performed multivariable regression analyses adjusted for confounders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this allowed them to investigate cortisol’s impact at an earlier stage of Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, where interventions might be most effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the neuroprotective effects of estrogen and testosterone, which mitigate cortisol’s deleterious impact on neural tissues, they also explored sex-specific differences, focusing particularly on post-menopausal risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They hypothesized that cortisol’s impact on Alzheimer’s pathology would be more pronounced in women, especially after menopause, consistent with some previous findings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, they found that post-menopausal women with high midlife cortisol are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, and that post-menopausal hormone changes may amplify cortisol’s effects on amyloid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Longitudinal follow-up of our cohort will be crucial to determine whether these early amyloid changes translate into clinical symptoms and to clarify the causal role of cortisol in Alzheimer’s disease development,” Salardini said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1d7178786e2f2f5d6869756e7e6e7c33787968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Steven Lee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UT San Antonio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Steven Lee – UT San Antonio&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elevated serum cortisol associated with early-detected increase of brain amyloid deposition in Alzheimer’s disease imaging biomarkers among menopausal women: The Framingham Heart Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Arash Salardini et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevated serum cortisol associated with early-detected increase of brain amyloid deposition in Alzheimer’s disease imaging biomarkers among menopausal women: The Framingham Heart Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70179-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates whether midlife cortisol levels predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarker burden 15 years later, with particular attention to sex differences and menopausal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70179-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed data from 305 cognitively unimpaired Framingham Heart Study participants (48.5% female; mean age: 39.6 ± 8.1 years).

The study may help identify better ways to protect infants from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the first studies to characterize the immune response in young infants hospitalized with severe COVID-19 with high-resolution,” said co-corresponding author Octavio Ramilo, MD, St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the infant immune system’s response to SARS-CoV-2 looks nothing like the immune response at any other age, highlighting the need to study infants, specifically, if we want to prevent severe infections and understand the unique features of the infant immune system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collaborators studied immune cells from infants ranging from a few weeks to 16 months old who were hospitalized with mild, moderate or severe disease. They compared those cells to immune cells from healthy infants and a published cohort of adults hospitalized with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monocytes (a type of white blood cell) from hospitalized infants appeared to have some similar features to those in adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, two other major white blood cell types, T and B cells, looked very different than in any other group. Hospitalized infants had more CD4 T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, both T and B cells were still activated despite being largely naïve, having never encountered an infection. These infants’ T and B cells also expressed the antiviral interferon response, which led to high expression of interferon-stimulated genes at a much higher level than in older children or adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflicting signals from the infant immune system &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all infant immune cells expressed high levels of interferon-stimulated genes. At the same time, when the collaborators tested blood from these infants, they found high levels of inflammation-causing molecules (inflammatory cytokines), which differs from previous observations in infants with mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge previous beliefs about infant immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normally, we think about the interferon and inflammation systems being in balance with each other,” said co-first author M. Asunción Mejías, MD, PhD, St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one is upregulated, the other is downregulated. But what we found was different. In infants, both systems were upregulated in the same cells, monocytes, which we’ve never seen before in other respiratory viral infections.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists identified the differences in these infants’ immune responses through single-cell RNA sequencing of white blood cells. RNA is a copy of instructions from DNA that lets cells express genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By looking at the RNA from individual cells, the researchers found the features unique to infants and compared them by disease severity. They found more severe disease associated with higher interferon and interferon-stimulated gene expression. High levels of inflammatory cytokines also correlated with more severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s unclear whether these high levels of interferon, interferon-stimulated genes and inflammatory cytokines are protecting those with severe disease or contributing to it,” Ramilo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But they are clearly playing a critical role, which will require further studies.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding infant antibody response is a field in its infancy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B cells produce specialized molecules called antibodies that target particular parts of viruses, bind to them and stop infections. An infant typically relies on their mother’s antibodies until they are about 6 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, the researchers examined whether a mother’s immunity to non-SARS coronaviruses, which cause the common cold, would help protect infants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that these infants made a strong and robust new antibody response to SARS-CoV-2,” said Mejías.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their pre-existing maternal antibodies against the endemic coronaviruses did not block infection at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding was surprising; some infants were as young as just a few weeks old and still created an antibody response to the virus. Infants are typically much older before they begin building such responses for other respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children in the study also lacked anti-interferon antibodies, which have been associated with severe COVID-19 in adults, emphasizing that lessons from adult immunity may not translate to infant immune responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that these hospitalized infants responded to SARS-CoV-2, but differently than anyone else,” Ramilo said. “As COVID-19 is now an endemic disease, we need to understand the unique features of the infant immune system better so we can find ways to help these babies through such infections during their first months of life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors and funding &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s other first author is Djamel Nehar-Belaid of The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine.

However, no systematic studies have been reported from infants hospitalized with severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We applied a multidimensional approach to decipher the immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infected infants (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 26; 10 subacute, 11 moderate and 5 severe disease; median age = 1.6 months) and matched controls (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 14; median age = 2 months).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single cell (scRNA-seq) profiling of PBMCs revealed substantial alterations in cell composition in SARS-CoV-2 infected infants; with most cell-types switching to an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt;) state including: (i) CD14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes co-expressing ISGs and inflammasome-related molecules, (ii) ISG&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; naive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, (iii) ISG&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; proliferating cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, and (iv) ISG&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; naive and transitional B cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observe increased serum concentrations of both interferons and inflammatory cytokines in infected infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are also consistently detected in the absence of anti-IFN autoantibodies. Compared with infected adults, infants display a similar ISG signature in monocytes but a markedly enhanced ISG signature in T and B cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide insights into the distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 in the first year of life and underscore the importance of further defining the unique features of early life immunity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 14:59:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBsVmlNUUd4TVhRTWkxQ1FTQkNOcG9pc3JZem1MOGlyeVpUcm4tZFFpSlJQdmhuS0QtRDJsUmJWUVFZV1pmcWdZeXR3Qzhxejk5SVZiMmpxeUc4cVBZLW0yeC02VXdJbE9MNEFWZGNkRQ</guid></item><item><title>一劳永逸的治愈方法：全新凝胶可在24小时内消除耳部感染- SciTechDaily | One-and-Done Cure: New Gel Wipes Out Ear Infections in 24 Hours - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxOanQxTG1vdm5jWUY2RTRvblFqejFtVlhuTElnQWJhajJYUkNSWGdkelJOcGlyMkNVbWhmbHhWaXNuWXNmN2hiX0FhZmc2NGxfUFNVNEFEMGdtek5qZXNONzFEZ09tdXhpcnBnUzZQbDFmN3QxbkdYdFlDeU9pM0ZyRU94LXBMb1NISHotOVhuM2ZnZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 14:11:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOanQxTG1vdm5jWUY2RTRvblFqejFtVlhuTElnQWJhajJYUkNSWGdkelJOcGlyMkNVbWhmbHhWaXNuWXNmN2hiX0FhZmc2NGxfUFNVNEFEMGdtek5qZXNONzFEZ09tdXhpcnBnUzZQbDFmN3QxbkdYdFlDeU9pM0ZyRU94LXBMb1NISHotOVhuM2ZnZw</guid></item><item><title>每个人都痴迷于蛋白质，但我们实际上缺少的是纤维-《独立报》 | Everyone’s obsessed with protein but what we’re actually lacking is fiber - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPSHhId0NJLUdwU0lMT3lYNTZ3UjBrVkdyWE9lWU1UUDYwMzhYQk53SmRHbmhlNFBfM0V0a0FaaUlDRUJ3cTZIRzBOME9CWDZPZFliZ2dwV28wQktTLWQ5c3lyUjFFYW4zSVNOd3JxWjlUUXNoTEczV05UaTFIck1WSFJXeHFiRWpNejNITF9FWXJ0QnE5QVRqOHpqeG91bGlweEpnMw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 cDGSNR"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 kxbAkl"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 kGYWZt"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

However, the protein craze could mean we’re eating too much for our own good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s always been trends around foods that are extreme,” physiologist George Wells, Ph.D., told &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;. “We had low fat, then low sugar, and now we happen to have high protein. The extremes tend to catch people’s attention. But they’re not good for us and they never last.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the protein craze, we’re pushing an important nutrient to the side: fiber. Accredited Practicing Dietitian Kim Lindsay says fiber is ignored because carbohydrates have been demonized and feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When there's a trend towards a low-carb, higher protein, if we're reducing the amount of carbohydrates that we're eating, we're going to naturally reduce the amount of fiber that we're taking in, right?” Lindsay explained. “We have to have a balanced &lt;a href="/topic/diet"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; where we include plant foods, protein-containing foods, and fats in our diet.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, balance is being pushed aside for protein-rich eggs, meat and seafood. Snacks previously called “junk food” are getting a wellness makeover, with added protein now found in many bars, chips and gummies. Even the Kardashians are on board, with Khloe Kardashian recently &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJEfXdrpOO_/"&gt;launching her protein popcorn&lt;/a&gt;, “Kloud,” which offers seven grams of protein per one cup of popcorn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://foodinsight.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-IFIC-Food-Health-Survey.pdf"&gt;The International Food Information Council’s annual survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 71 percent of consumers were trying to increase their protein intake this year, a 6 percent rise from 2023. The survey also found that exposure to food and nutrition content online, much of which is protein focused, is up by 54 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, protein is an essential macronutrient to help bodily functions, like fighting infection, providing energy, and building and maintaining muscle mass. Intake depends on body weight, with general guidance being that a just over a third of the calories we consume each day should come from protein. So, with the average American woman weighing around 171 pounds, she should consume about 62 grams of protein a day. The average American man, at around 200 pounds, should eat about 72 grams of protein daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dcuwoN"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/23/iStock-1644746219.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-55508"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;(Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Wells believes that due to social media, we’re only focused on having as much protein as possible. “I think the craze around protein right now probably is linked to bodybuilding and the obsession with body composition — looking like you have the six-pack abs,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that ignores the flip side. “If you have too much protein, it's really hard for the body to deal with all of the amino acids that are floating around,” Wells added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where fiber comes in handy. Typically found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, fiber is particularly beneficial to your digestive system and keeping you regular. While men should have about 38 grams a day and women should have 25 grams, as noted by dietitian Kristin Kirkpatrick, you shouldn’t just jump into doing that if you’ve been eating way less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber intake should be tailored to the individual and the microbiome. However, if you are well under this amount, you should go slow to allow the body adequate time to adjust,” Kirkpatrick, the owner of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.kristinkirkpatrick.com/"&gt;KAK nutrition consulting,&lt;/a&gt; explained. She added that fiber can also prevent certain cancers and type 2 diabetes and improve heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 gTGbNB"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/07/21/59/iStock-95229504.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-55509"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt;(Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies have found a fiber deficiency among Americans. According to a study published in &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6124841/#bibr10-1559827615588079"&gt;the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, only five percent of the population has the recommended amount of fiber a day. Inadequate intake can result in health issues like chronic constipation and gastrointestinal problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to avoiding high-processed foods just because they’ve got extra protein added to them, we should focus on eating real foods that are naturally high in fiber rather than ultra-processed foods with bits of fiber in them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gravitate towards highly processed foods because they're engineered to taste fantastic,” Wells said. ”They're high in sugar and salts, and we crave them as a result.

A new framework suggests that focused attention meditation may benefit those who worry chronically, while open monitoring may help individuals with hypervigilance and physical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key mechanism behind this benefit is improved cognitive control—the ability to manage thoughts and behaviors in alignment with goals. Anxiety disrupts this control, but mindfulness strengthens it, helping to break the cycle of worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailored Practices:&lt;/strong&gt; Focused attention helps worriers; open monitoring helps the hypervigilant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Control:&lt;/strong&gt; Mindfulness improves goal-oriented thinking disrupted by anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientific Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain imaging confirms mindfulness alters areas linked to emotional regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re anxious about work, finances, the state of the world, or anything else, you might try a moment of mindfulness. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying close attention to the present moment without judgment — the basic idea behind all mindfulness techniques — can help calm anxiety and improve focus, said Resh Gupta, a postdoctoral research associate with the Mindfulness Science and Practice research cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “A lot of research has shown that mindfulness can reduce anxiety symptoms,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110055"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and bight colors." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mindfulness-anxiety-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Depending on the type of anxiety people are experiencing, some approaches might work better than others. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calming power of mindfulness is well-known to people who have made the practice a part of their daily lives. Still, experts continue to investigate how it works and which types of mindfulness might be most useful for different types of anxiety, ranging from fleeting bouts of worry to more chronic, clinical anxiety disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all experience anxiety, but it can manifest in many different ways,” Gupta said. “It’s a tough problem to pin down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper published in&lt;em&gt; Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews&lt;/em&gt;, Gupta and co-authors laid out a new approach to understanding the relationship between mindfulness and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of taking a one-size-fits-all approach, they propose that different kinds of mindfulness practices might be helpful for different varieties of anxiety. The proposed framework should ultimately help us understand how to match anxiety sufferers with more precise treatments, Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Braver, the William R. Stuckenberg Professor in Human Values and Moral Development and a professor of psychological and brain sciences, is a co-author of the paper. The other co-author is Wendy Heller, a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported in part by the Mindfulness Science and Practice cluster and the Arts &amp;amp; Sciences’ Incubator for Transdisciplinary Futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braver said that the new paper is emblematic of the kinds of work being done by the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a growing recognition that these practices can be incredibly useful in enhancing psychological well-being,” Braver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we still do not fully understand the mechanisms of action by which mindfulness can produce beneficial effects. That’s where the scientific research can be so valuable, by helping us more precisely identify why and how certain practices are effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, Braver, and Heller suggest that mindfulness combats anxiety by improving a mental process called cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive control is the ability to regulate your thoughts and your actions in a way that helps you achieve your goals,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, if you know you have to go to the grocery store right after work, you can keep that goal in mind during the workday and turn down an offer to do something else after work.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Gupta explained, mindfulness and anxiety have opposite impacts on cognitive control. People who are more mindful generally perform better on tasks requiring cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That observation is supported by neuroimaging studies, which have shown that mindfulness meditation can effectively modulate activity in brain regions that support cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, anxiety can worsen cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Worry occupies a lot of space in the brain’s working memory system,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is where your goals are stored.” This impairment in cognitive control can intensify worry symptoms, but using mindfulness to improve cognitive control can help interrupt the harmful cycle of worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of anxiety people are experiencing, some approaches might work better than others, Gupta said. People who spend a lot of time worrying may especially benefit from a type of mindfulness meditation called focused attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focused attention teaches you to choose an anchor, such as your breath or a sound,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You keep bringing your attention back to that anchor every time your mind wanders. Instead of focusing on the worry, you’re focusing on the present moment experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are hypervigilant and experiencing a lot of physical symptoms of anxiety — rapid heartbeat, sweaty palms, tightness in the chest — may do better with a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For this type of anxiety, a form of mindfulness meditation called open monitoring may be beneficial,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of focusing on one thing, such as the breath, you can observe all internal and external experiences from moment to moment in a non-reactive, non-judgmental way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WashU’s Mindfulness Science &amp;amp; Practice cluster offers many resources for university and community members who want to add mindfulness to their lives. The cluster sponsors regular talks as well as other events, including those in which participants can learn mindfulness practices from trained practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re dedicated to helping the WashU and greater St. Louis community get access to tools to learn about mindfulness science and practice,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braver is enthusiastic that recent research from the cluster and other institutions will help people gain a greater appreciation of the wide variety of practices that fall under the mindfulness umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have different options they can choose from, so it becomes easier to find one that best fits your particular temperament, concerns, or current situation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite empowering to learn these types of practices, and to feel like we can be in charge of how we use them to improve our quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mindfulness and anxiety research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6b0718030a0d0d0e192b1c1e181f07450e0f1e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chris Woolston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wustl.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WUSTL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact:&lt;/strong&gt; Chris Woolston – WUSTL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2025.106146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reconceptualizing the relationship between anxiety, mindfulness, and cognitive control&lt;/a&gt;” by Resh Gupta et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconceptualizing the relationship between anxiety, mindfulness, and cognitive control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research has provided initial support for the claim that cognitive control mediates the relationship between anxiety and mindfulness; however, findings are often inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this review, we argue that the inconsistency may be due to a lack of both conceptual and methodological precision in terms of how anxiety, cognitive control, and mindfulness are operationalized and assessed, and that this imprecision may be a critical source of study confounds and ambiguous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We unpack this argument by first decomposing anxiety, cognitive control, mindfulness, and relevant experimental paradigms into key dimensions in order to develop a non-unitary, multi-dimensional taxonomy of these constructs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, we review and reinterpret the prior experimental literature, focusing on studies that examine the relationship between anxiety and cognitive control, mindfulness and cognitive control, and the three-way relationship between anxiety, mindfulness, and cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the reviewed studies, there was great variation in the dimensions being examined and the behavioral and/or neural measures employed; therefore, results were often mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on this review of literature, we propose a conceptually and methodologically precise framework from which to study the effects of mindfulness on cognitive control in anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The framework theoretically aligns anxiety dimensions with specific mindfulness states and interventions, further suggesting how these will impact specific cognitive control dimensions (proactive, reactive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These can be assessed with experimental paradigms and associated behavioral and neural metrics to index the relevant dimensions with high precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novel experimental studies and tractable research designs are also proposed to rigorously test this theoretical framework.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 13:52:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBKMmg0TmllWFlMZlhVVHRwUjNRRFRmQWl5RWNJZnlOa1NrbjJHUnlVQkdydmZIT3hXb09zM3owc0ZlYlRDUjJHdm1LX3BTT1R3cDZTejM1akduandzaTZNem1iNmIwRk9GYThIb3ZOeWI3YzFf</guid></item><item><title>呼吸困难、恶心、咳嗽和肿块提示癌症。是吗？ -《华盛顿邮报》 | Breathlessness, nausea, a cough and a mass suggested cancer.

She also began coughing incessantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J7XQDATGKNCMNMNFUMCC7GBI3U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We thought it was food poisoning and brushed it off, but I was throwing up once or twice a day, every day,” says Cresencia, now 27, who works remotely for a health insurance company as a user experience manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2WZZ5YLV5JGRVGBDRXFEDGGI2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“She was also coughing up small amounts of blood,” recalls Nguyen, now 28, a software engineer. “It really freaked me out,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZMZUHA6P3NBIRMJJPTXSKUSZQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nevertheless, they continued on with the trip but curtailed their activities and food, and flew home at the end of the week. Once back in San Diego, Cresencia says, “the symptoms seemed to calm down a bit, I started to go days without throwing up, and my breathing also improved. I told myself it had to have been something about New York.” But a few weeks later, while in the San Francisco Bay Area visiting Nguyen, she suddenly developed a new and worrisome symptom: very swollen feet. “They didn’t hurt. They were just filled with fluid,” she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KHLKXQVZ7JBDTA5FVVGIGWYZVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nguyen took her to an urgent care facility, where doctors ran a series of tests, including a CT scan that found a mass on her heart, a shocking discovery in someone so young. She was terrified. “My heart dropped and my ears felt hot,” she recalls. “How did it form? Did I have cancer? Did I do something wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VIBGWUUL4NCTBOJNLRM7AHSIKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The finding was the start of a harrowing months-long ordeal to figure out what the mass was, including a biopsy that nearly killed her and the radical surgery that saved her life — and revealed what had made her so sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EN4JZIIJWJAY3NNU5JPDGSOWAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“While I do wish I would have gotten my health checked sooner, I’ve found myself focusing less on the past and more on enjoying the now,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="AMHHYQAFVFEVXOQN24PDJAD6DE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="AMHHYQAFVFEVXOQN24PDJAD6DE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;From urgent care to the hospital&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HRE2OJFWYJGB5PDBWOU2MYKDIE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cresencia had been coping with shortness of breath for several years, mostly when walking up hills, but she ignored it, thinking it was too “subtle” to bother seeing a doctor. The New York trip changed that. “It was worse than usual,” she says, and the bouts of nausea and bloody coughing were new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J47XN4DOZVBFLLT7QY243DATTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the urgent care, doctors were clearly worried about the mass they’d seen on the CT scan and urged Cresencia to go to the hospital. The couple went to a small community hospital near Nguyen’s home in the San Francisco Bay Area. After a six-hour wait, a physician finally examined her and immediately admitted her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J6FYURH5XVFFTJ6DWPO4WYT45E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The next day, wanting a closer look, the doctors at the hospital ran a transesophageal echocardiogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to view detailed images of the heart and its surrounding structures. It showed a large growth in the left atrium, one of the heart’s two upper chambers, and doctors told her it almost certainly was the underlying cause of her symptoms. They recommended she seek specialty care at a larger hospital, and a week later, in San Diego, doctors at a second hospital ran additional tests, saw the mass and also told her they thought they saw “holes in my lungs,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GWVGMNAJ6JAQBCB4QM5SWMBWYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The doctors told her she would probably need a heart-lung transplant and sent her to Jacobs Medical Center at UC San Diego Health in La Jolla, the only hospital in the area that performs such surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body grid-body grid-center" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-testid="quote" class="wpds-c-hqmxme wpds-c-hqmxme-fDUVQq-showBorder-true wpds-c-hqmxme-iPJLV-css article-quote relative border-box font-light black font--headline mr-lg-mod-ns"&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="BHBM76UGCBD65EPZHX2I3N33QA" data-apitype="text" data-qa="article-quote" class="wpds-c-PJLV"&gt;“We thought it was food poisoning and brushed it off, but I was throwing up once or twice a day, every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="wpds-c-jFMeKj"&gt;— Chelsea Cresencia &lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MANK6X3NCZCQLOHUTMBFLS3SXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There, cardiac specialists told Cresencia there were no holes in her lungs, but they thought she had an angiosarcoma of the heart, a rare and virulent cancer that originates in the lining of the blood vessels and has a grim prognosis. “They told me … it wouldn’t look good if that’s what it was,” she says. “I was terrified. I cried a lot because I was scared of dying and afraid of losing Allen and my family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GFK6GNHLJFFXFEOYANG6VS434" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The treatment for angiosarcoma varies, depending on the tumor’s size and location, and can involve both surgery and chemotherapy.

Under anesthesia, the right side of Cresencia’s heart — already under strain — experienced failure and circulatory collapse, known as shock. When this happens, the circulatory system is unable to supply oxygen and nutrients to the body’s tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="T7I7WV37PBDDJKJ7E5TIRBUNVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To save her, the doctors hooked Cresencia up to life-support technology that takes over a patient’s breathing and heart function. She was on an ECMO — or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — machine for 10 days, intubated and sedated until she finally stabilized, and while her doctors debated what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YMHQOXLXFAQFMSB7K4GE4OUME" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They decided they had no choice but to operate and remove as much of the mass as possible, even not knowing exactly what it was. Given that her heart failure was worsening, “there were no other options other than trying to remove as much of the tumor as possible. … Without surgery, we considered her prognosis terminal,” Urey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IABDCWPQ45CEJN2ABGTBT25DZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I told the surgeon she will die if we do nothing,” Urey recalls, and then reached out to her family “and everyone was on the same page. She was&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at high risk of dying if we identified a sarcoma, but had a 100 percent certainty of death if we did nothing. Everyone wanted to give it a shot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZVBDXDGIPFF43GKJ6LSJ7ICPKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They scheduled immediate surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBJLTB5EMFDCBJ4U4BJVC6Z3YE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cresencia has no memory of her time on ECMO or of going into surgery. However, her doctors and Nguyen recall how at one point she scribbled “I love you” with a permanent marker on the arms of Nguyen, her parents and her five siblings. The night before her surgery, Cresencia gave her surgeon, Victor Pretorius, a fist bump and handed him a note where she had written: “You got this!” Pretorius recalls her anxiety. “I could see it in her eyes, the fear. She was really courageous, trying to say goodbye to her family. It was very hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UVMGKUXPEJCK5PE7K52C2TK6KM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The surgery took nearly 10 hours and involved an 11-person team of two surgeons, three anesthesiologists, four nurses and two technicians. With Cresencia still on ECMO, Pretorius removed her heart and — while it was outside her body — cut away the tumor and reconstructed the affected left atrium using artificial pig tissue. He also removed scar tissue from three of four pulmonary veins to open them up. He says he couldn’t do much with the fourth because it was too scarred. The doctors then put her heart back into her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SRWNDQRRKNHRVP4A4OHWNTIPGQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pretorius says the mass he’d removed “looked nothing like angiosarcoma. It was hard and leathery. I wasn’t sure what it was. I took a piece of it and sent it to the pathologist for a quick evaluation. They called back within an hour and told us they didn’t see any malignant cells.” So it was not a deadly angiosarcoma as they had feared. But pathologists saw a type of white blood cell called histiocytes, which provided the first real clue about what was wrong with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="YGZXRGVUAZBB7MEHOVM67U4PLM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="YGZXRGVUAZBB7MEHOVM67U4PLM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The pathology report&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GPJNPH2EZRAD7O2QISSZLMLGQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When the final pathology report finally came in, the analysis found that the mass was made up of a proliferation of histiocytes — the hallmark of a very rare disorder known as &lt;a href="https://histio.org/histiocytic-disorders/rosai-dorfman-disease/" target="_blank"&gt;Rosai-Dorfman disease&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that most often affects children, teens and young adults. Only about 1 in every 200,000 people get it, according to the Cleveland Clinic. It causes an overgrowth of the immune system’s white blood cells, most often in lymph nodes, leading to excessive swelling, but also much less commonly in other sites in the body as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OJONIP54BJHQRNE76OQOIA2VUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Most physicians have never heard of it,” says Aaron Goodman, the UC San Diego hematologist who now is monitoring her. “They don’t know what it is and have never seen it. [It] is an incredibly rare disease to begin with, and hers was a very rare presentation of a very rare disease. It was in a bad spot and could have been lethal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HUUKVRME5ZHBBH4DZGPGG2YSEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some patients, treatment includes the use of medications such as steroids, drugs to suppress the immune system and sometimes chemotherapy. In Cresencia’s case, however, physicians believe they removed the entire tumor, so “there is nothing for me to do except surveillance,” Goodman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DJ4F6KRJZ5D6FFDNVQKT4YH4HI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Cresencia has periodic MRIs to ensure it doesn’t return — and so far, it hasn’t.

Analyzing data from over 2,500 individuals, researchers identified combinations of personality traits—called personality styles—that either increase or protect against long-term mental health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High neuroticism consistently emerged as a risk factor, while low neuroticism and other balanced trait profiles appeared to be protective. These findings challenge the idea that personality is fixed and suggest that traits may be modifiable through therapy or coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Styles:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific personality trait combinations forecast depression risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifiable Traits:&lt;/strong&gt; Traits once considered fixed may be improved through therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalized Care:&lt;/strong&gt; Personality tests could guide tailored bipolar treatment planning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with cancer, heart disease and other conditions have come to expect treatments that their medical teams “personalize” just for them, based on tests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But care for mental health conditions hasn’t gotten to that point yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new study suggests that it might be possible to personalize care for people with bipolar disorder, using the results of detailed personality tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research finds that such tests might help identify people who have certain combinations of personality traits that could raise or lower their risk of repeated depressive episodes or poor functioning in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from more than 2,500 people with bipolar disorder who took part in two long-term studies, the researchers say certain personality styles – combinations of personality traits – emerged as predictors of bipolar disorder outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These personality styles are based on within person characteristics rather than these characteristics between individuals.  Thus, they are very personalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ratio of protective personality styles to risk-elevating personality styles was especially important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, by researchers from the University of Michigan’s Heinz C. Prechter Bipolar Research Program, is published in the Journal of Affective Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Kelly Ryan, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist and professor in the U-M Department of Psychiatry, notes that the personality tests used in the study are often used in psychology settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are really exciting because we don’t know why some patients with bipolar disorder are more resilient and bounce back or have fewer episodes of depression, but now we can see that this could be linked to the makeup of their personality,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that this can eventually inform the treatment planning that clinicians do for patients, knowing who may be at higher risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients, too, could act on the result of their personality tests, using them to help understand their experience and working with their clinicians to modify traits that might raise their long-term risk of depression and poor life management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality traits were once thought of as enduring characteristics for each individual, but now there’s evidence that traits can change over the course of therapy or with coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, someone who scores low on the “openness” personality trait – which, when in the normal or average range, is protective — might be guided therapeutically to seek out new experiences through arts or nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More about the study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan and her colleagues used data from the Prechter program’s long-term study that’s been gathering data on hundreds of people with bipolar disorder over more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is based on a sample of 489 people with bipolar disorder who took the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R), a 240-item personality test, as well as taking short questionnaires in follow up clinical assessments about their level of depression and life functioning every two months and/or every two years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers assigned each person to their individual personality styles based on scores for various combinations of traits using their test results, a standard practice using the NEO-PI-R, and then looked at each person’s number of major depressive episodes and life functioning scores over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the 30 personality styles emerged as having higher risk for depression and poor functioning, while other personality styles emerged as lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, all the personality styles that included a high score on the personality trait called neuroticism (prone to emotional instability and negative thinking) appeared to raise the risk of depression. And styles that involved a low score on neuroticism appeared to be protective against depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other personality styles not involving neuroticism also were associated with higher or lower risk of frequent depression episodes too. The same held true for predicting poor life functioning, with low levels of neuroticism appearing to be especially protective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they tested this framework on data from another group of over 2,000 people with bipolar disorder, who had enrolled in the STEP-BD trial and taken the shorter NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) personality test. The STEP-BD group had their depression and life functioning measured by clinicians every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-thirds of the 12 personality risk styles that had predicted higher risk of depression in the Prechter group also predicted it in this larger group, while  9 of the 16 styles that had seemed protective in the Prechter group also seemed to have that protective effect in this group. This replication helps Ryan and her colleagues have confidence in the model they created using Prechter data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan notes that it’s the interaction between personality styles, and the balance of protective vs. risk-increasing ones, that appears to matter most and can potentially be used clinically to help those with bipolar have less depressive episodes and higher life functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Heinz C. Prechter Bipolar Research Fund and the Richard Tam Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Ryan, the study’s authors are Anastasia K. Yocum, Yuhua Zhang, Peisong Han, David F. Marshall, Paul T.

Potential predictors of outcomes for BD that could inform practice include personality traits, particularly Neuroticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, models typically fail to consider the joint effect of multiple personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examine whether personality trait combinations (styles) enhance our ability to prospectively predict symptoms and functioning across time in two independent longitudinal research cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a discovery sample of 489 and replication sample of 2072 individuals with BD, we assessed impact of personality styles using the NEO PI-R and NEO-FFI on depression and functioning up to 14 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a model considering all ten possible personality style combinations, the number of risk-related personality styles (styles associated with poor outcomes) relative to number of protective-related personality styles (styles associated with better outcomes) showed that for every additional risk relative to protective style count, the incident rate of depression increased by 11.8–15.0 % and the incident rate for poor life functioning increased by 11.1 %.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This similar pattern of increased risk styles being associated with significant increases in depression and functioning was replicated in the independent STEP-BD dataset, although with slightly lower incident rate (5 % and 2.9 %). Cross validation of performance from both cohorts showed similar predictive patterns (5–11.2 % increases).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to predict future depression and poor functioning from the combined effects of personality traits can be clinically useful for identifying individuals at risk for poorer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality styles should be evaluated when planning long-term care and developing interventions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 12:59:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFAzdW4zUmRDanRiRHhiQmRua1djU1ZWbGpEek1FbjJyeUpEZWpxSm94bnBRaW54YnVDSXEzTG1lWVBHdXMxaUJKZ3NVd19SbTFUOEotWnBXbTctS1NQZ1BNRU4tR0Jpd2tyQjZiUVc3UTd5QQ</guid></item><item><title>优于缝合：研究人员开发了用于软器官损伤的生物相容性贴片- Medical Xpress | Better than stitches: Researchers develop biocompatible patch for soft organ injuries - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNYVE4Yi1uX0pHZFZpdm5oaTZPQkNPNGt5Xzg5WmpDYzBrdk1jcUdUMTZBRFU2azE3QlBqMV9QYXFrbVk5WktEbVBnUlctX1hoYm0ycnFVTDlTTDY1eDFRMDZaYW5VblVQczVpeVRSMldsV1RYQUVsTHV6TTVoQzQwZnJoaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of California, Los Angeles and University of California, San Diego researchers developed an injectable sealant for rapid hemostasis and tissue adhesion in soft, elastic organs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Injuries to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/soft+tissues/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;soft tissues&lt;/a&gt; such as lungs, heart, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; complicate surgical closure due to their constant motion and elasticity. Sutures, wires, and staples are mechanically fixed, risking &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood loss&lt;/a&gt; when applied to tissues that expand and contract with each breath or heartbeat. Existing hemostatic agents, including fibrin-based sealants, aim to stem blood flow but may trigger intense coagulation responses in patients with clotting disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products like cyanoacrylates deliver strong adhesion yet introduce excessive stiffness that can disrupt natural tissue movement and cause cytotoxic effects. Natural polymer hydrogels are biocompatible but often lack the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mechanical+strength/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mechanical strength&lt;/a&gt; and adhesion needed for sealing wet or highly elastic surfaces. Progel and poly(ethylene glycol)-based FocalSeal demonstrate limited elasticity and require extended application times, reducing their effectiveness in dynamic tissue environments.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Soft tissue sealants that integrate hemostasis, flexibility, and adhesion remain limited. MeTro previously showed biocompatibility and mechanical properties resembling those of native elastic tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior modifications with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/graphene+oxide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;graphene oxide&lt;/a&gt; increased toughness, while methacryloyl-modified gelatin enhanced nerve repair. Hemostatic capabilities, however, remained a gap. SNs have the potential for improving clotting response while maintaining the sealant's mechanical integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Rapid closure and hemostasis of ruptured soft tissues using a modified human tropoelastin-based sealant in preclinical models," &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr6458" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted preclinical testing of an engineered hydrogel combining MeTro and Laponite SNs to assess tissue adhesion and hemostatic efficacy in soft tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preclinical testing involved arterial injury models in rat and lung injury in pig subjects to assess the sealant's performance in soft, elastic organs. Researchers measured adhesion strength, clotting time, and tissue response to evaluate the effectiveness of the MeTro/SN formulation under dynamic physiological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepolymer solutions of MeTro and varying concentrations of SNs were prepared and cross-linked using visible light. Rat and pig subjects underwent injury procedures to assess the sealant's efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Testing involved ex vivo adhesion strength measurements on pig skin, lung, and heart tissues, with burst pressure evaluated on punctured collagen sheets. Hemostatic performance was assessed through clotting time analysis using fresh human blood treated with MeTro/SN hydrogels and commercial hemostatic agents.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biocompatibility assessments included live/dead staining and histological analysis of tissue surrounding MeTro/SN hydrogel implants. Additional testing included zeta potential analysis to evaluate electrostatic interactions and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nuclear+magnetic+resonance+spectroscopy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt; to confirm cross-linking and chemical composition of the hydrogel matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MeTro/SN hydrogels exhibited increased adhesion strength and burst pressure compared to MeTro alone and commercial sealants. On pig lung tissue, MeTro/SN achieved an adhesion strength of 23 kPa compared to 12 kPa for MeTro. Burst pressure of MeTro/SN hydrogels containing 1% SN reached 3.6 kPa, exceeding MeTro's 2.8 kPa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ex vivo heart burst pressure tests, MeTro/SN tolerated pressures of 47 kPa compared to 41 kPa for MeTro, indicating improved structural integrity. Collagen-sheet burst pressure tests also showed superior mechanical strength in MeTro/SN-treated samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemostatic testing demonstrated reduced clotting time in MeTro/SN-treated samples compared to untreated controls. Blood treated with MeTro/SN hydrogels containing 1% SN clotted within 12 minutes, while untreated blood required 15 minutes. No increase in hemolysis was observed, indicating minimal cell damage despite the faster clotting response.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In the rat tail amputation model, MeTro/SN hydrogels reduced blood loss by approximately 91% compared to MeTro and by 99% compared to untreated controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histological analysis revealed no significant inflammatory response surrounding MeTro/SN implants after seven and 28 days in rat subcutaneous tissue. No fibrosis or lymphocyte infiltration was observed, indicating biocompatibility of the hydrogel formulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the pig lung injury model, MeTro/SN hydrogels maintained seal integrity and prevented blood loss for 14 days under physiological pressures. No significant detachment or tissue damage was observed during pressure testing, confirming the hydrogel's adhesive stability in dynamic tissue environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers conclude that MeTro/SN hydrogels provide effective sealing and hemostasis in soft, elastic tissues while maintaining biocompatibility in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/preclinical+models/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;preclinical models&lt;/a&gt;. Improved adhesion strength and burst pressure on lung and arterial tissues indicate the potential for clinical application in traumatic injuries where conventional sealants fail to adhere under dynamic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration of SNs reduced clotting time without inducing inflammatory responses, supporting the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hydrogel/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hydrogel&lt;/a&gt;'s potential for rapid intervention in hemorrhagic wounds. Biocompatibility analysis demonstrated minimal immune response and tissue damage after implantation, suggesting a low-risk profile for clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists created an Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas to profile gene expression across 219 cell types in flies expressing human Alzheimer’s proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that Aβ42 mainly damages neurons, particularly those tied to senses like smell, while Tau impacts peripheral tissues, disrupting metabolism, digestion, and fertility. These findings highlight how Alzheimer’s disrupts brain-body communication and accelerates aging-like changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole-Body Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Aβ42 and Tau proteins affect both brain and peripheral tissues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Aβ42 harms sensory neurons, while Tau disrupts metabolism and fertility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Research Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; The Fly Cell Atlas enables exploration of Alzheimer’s beyond the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While Alzheimer’s disease is mostly considered a disorder of the brain, emerging evidence suggests that the condition also affects other organs of the body. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with the laboratory fruit fly, researchers at Baylor College of Medicine, the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children’s Hospital (Duncan NRI) and collaborating institutions provide a new understanding of how Alzheimer’s disease affects different tissues across the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110043"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-whole-body-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers created Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies by expressing Aβ42 or Tau only in the neurons of adult flies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, reveal new insights into brain-body communication in neurodegeneration and pave the way for identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation in the brain of amyloid plaques containing the Aβ42 protein and tangles of thread-like structures of the Tau protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To better understand how the disorder affects other organs in the body, we created an Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas, which profiles the genes expressed by single cells of 219 cell types in the heads and bodies of Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies,” said co-corresponding author Dr.  Hongjie Li, assistant professor of molecular and human genetics and the Huffington Center on Aging at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is also a member of Baylor’s Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers created Alzheimer’s disease fruit flies by expressing Aβ42 or Tau only in the neurons of adult flies. This approach avoids developmental effects and focuses on adult characteristics. Then, they assessed the presence of changes in the brains and other organs of these modified flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that expressing Aβ42 or Tau in neurons affected both neurons and other tissues in the fruit fly body,” said co-first author Ye-Jin Park, a graduate student co-mentored by Li and Dr. Hugo Bellen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aβ42 expression primarily affected the nervous system. Sensory neurons involved in vision, audition and olfaction were particularly vulnerable. A decline in the sense of smell can be an early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease, and in this study we identified specific olfactory neurons affected by Aβ42 in fruit flies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other hand, Tau expression in neurons led to significant changes, mostly in peripheral tissues, for instance altered fat metabolism and digestion and reduced fecundity. These alterations mimic age-associated changes, suggesting that Tau expression accelerates aging,” said co-first author Dr. Tzu-Chiao Lu, a postdoctoral associate in the Li lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that neuronal connectivity and other factors that mediate brain-body communication were disrupted in Tau flies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These and other findings described in the Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas improve our understanding of how Alzheimer’s disease-associated proteins, Aβ42 and Tau, affect an organism as a whole,” said Bellen, co-corresponding author of the work. Bellen is a Distinguished Service Professor of Molecular and Human Genetics at Baylor and chair in neurogenetics&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the Duncan NRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive resource serves as a valuable tool for the neurodegeneration research community. The Alzheimer’s Disease Fly Cell Atlas enables further exploration of whole-body changes and brain-body interactions in Alzheimer’s disease that may lead to a better understanding of the condition and improved treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to this work include Tyler Jackson, Lindsey goodman, Lindsey Ran, Jiaye Chen, Chung-Yi Liang, Erin Harrison, Christina Ko, Xi Chen, Baiping Wang, Ao-Lin Hsu, Elizabeth Ochoa, Kevin F.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how AD impacts different tissues across the whole organism is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt;, we generated an AD Fly Cell Atlas (AD-FCA) based on whole-organism single-nucleus transcriptomes of 219 cell types from flies expressing AD-associated proteins, either human amyloid-β 42 peptide (Aβ42) or Tau, in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that Aβ42 primarily affects the nervous system, including sensory neurons, while Tau induces accelerated aging in peripheral tissues. We identified a neuronal cluster enriched in Aβ42 flies, which has high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This LDH-high cluster is conserved in 5XFAD mouse and human AD datasets. We found a conserved defect in fat metabolism from both fly and mouse tauopathy models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AD-FCA offers new insights into how Aβ42 or Tau systemically and differentially affects a whole organism and provides a valuable resource for understanding brain-body communication in neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 12:29:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFBITnRLNkxnUHJlWmdkUkxnYkFvbFQ3NzVPM19PR2dtc2RocnU2VjNzb05TVVdyZXpXaF9wTnpsbmx2MWJ2QzN3RGZJSFZfMXhDd3BjX005RGNxODZNd1dmNlBwcy1KUXJ1</guid></item><item><title>吸入DMT在治疗抵抗性抑郁症中产生快速持久的抗抑郁作用- PsyPost | Inhaled DMT produces rapid and lasting antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxPWEZTZHhUU3l1Nlk5M0ZBd3RiX0MwNnJmYU5nV1NpWG8yZXdaUlkyeTRjX0d2Mk9RenNxeVQyVl9RMlRQQXFabktPUVVZZ2sxSThKU1doU05DTU5FcmdtTXM5T0dCRGk1Y2Q5Yk5ySmJPY2E0b1JQd2lkdld6ZWF1ck5fMmdxUDNNal9aVzh3MjVJaVBnYzFfUVBWUW0wLXU4d3NadXpfanlhdGo0YzFNMUtMakh2V3hJSmxrdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-025-02091-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that inhaled N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a fast-acting psychedelic compound, produced rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in people with treatment-resistant depression. Participants reported major reductions in depression and suicidal thoughts within a day of dosing, with benefits lasting up to three months. The therapy was safe, well-tolerated, and may offer a more accessible alternative to existing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DMT is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain plants and also produced in small amounts in the human body. It is best known as the main psychoactive ingredient in the Amazonian brew ayahuasca, but unlike ayahuasca, which requires co-administration of substances that prolong its effects, vaporized DMT acts quickly and clears the system within about 20 minutes. Because of its short duration and inhalation delivery, DMT has attracted interest as a potentially more scalable and less disruptive option for psychedelic therapy. The researchers aimed to investigate whether this compound could offer fast, lasting relief for people with depression who have not responded to traditional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My team and I have been studying psychedelics, especially ayahuasca and DMT, for almost 20 years now,” said study author Draulio Barros de Araujo, a professor of neuroscience at the Brain Institute at Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte and director of the Center for Advanced Medical Psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What caught our attention with vaporized DMT is how it offers such a deep and intense psychedelic experience in a very short window of time. We were curious to see whether such a brief intervention, when supported properly, could still make a meaningful difference for people struggling with treatment-resistant depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on individuals with treatment-resistant depression—a severe form of depression that does not improve after trying at least two different antidepressant medications. Fourteen adults were recruited through online ads, clinician referrals, and word-of-mouth. All met criteria for moderate to severe depression and had failed to respond to multiple prior medications. Participants received two doses of inhaled DMT in a controlled hospital setting: a lower dose of 15 milligrams followed by a higher dose of 60 milligrams about 90 minutes later. Both sessions occurred on the same day and were accompanied by preparation and integration support from trained clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants inhaled DMT using a medical-grade vaporizer. During the experience, they lay back in a quiet room with dim lighting and calming music while being monitored by a psychiatrist, psychologist, and nurse. The team measured participants’ vital signs, mood, and subjective experience before, during, and after the sessions. Clinical assessments took place immediately after dosing, then at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that depression symptoms, measured by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), dropped significantly within 24 hours of treatment. On average, scores fell by 21 points—enough to shift many patients from a range of severe depression to mild or even minimal symptoms. About 79% of participants responded to the treatment by day 1, and 71% achieved full remission. By day 7, the response rate rose to nearly 86%, and more than half of participants remained in remission. Even after three months, 57% still showed a meaningful response and 36% remained in remission, despite receiving no further DMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most surprising aspects was just how consistently strong the clinical response was, even though the DMT experience itself only lasts about 10 to 20 minutes,” De Araujo told PsyPost. “Many participants not only reported emotional breakthroughs during the session, but also experienced lasting changes in mood and outlook from just a single dose. That’s not something we typically see with most psychiatric interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to easing depressive symptoms, inhaled DMT also sharply reduced suicidal thoughts. Nearly 90% of participants had suicidal ideation at the start of the study, with almost half considered to be at severe risk. One day after treatment, no participants showed severe suicidal ideation. Improvements in suicidality were maintained in most participants through the 3-month follow-up. Notably, the reduction in suicidal thoughts closely tracked with improvements in mood, suggesting that the antisuicidal effect was related to the overall antidepressant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjective reports indicated that the DMT experience was intense but generally positive. Participants described vivid imagery, altered perception, and insightfulness, with most rating the experience as pleasant. Physiological measurements showed temporary increases in blood pressure and heart rate shortly after dosing, similar to what might occur during moderate exercise, but no serious adverse events were reported. The most common side effects were throat irritation and coughing from inhalation, which resolved quickly. Headaches and mild discomfort were reported by some participants the following day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the intensity of the psychedelic experience did not predict treatment outcome. While some participants had mystical or highly visual experiences, the researchers found no strong statistical links between specific features of the trip and clinical improvements. This suggests that the therapeutic effects of DMT might not depend on achieving a particular type of altered state. However, one measure—complex visual imagery—did show a trend toward association with better outcomes, echoing past research on psychedelics like ayahuasca and psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most promising aspects of this treatment is its practicality. Unlike longer-acting psychedelics like psilocybin or LSD, which require several hours for each session, vaporized DMT produces its effects in about 20 minutes. The entire protocol—including screening, preparation, dosing, and integration—can be completed in a single day. This has important implications for making psychedelic-assisted therapy more affordable and scalable, especially in public health systems with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is that even an ultra-short psychedelic experience, when delivered in a safe and supportive setting, can lead to rapid and sustained improvements in depression,” De Araujo said. “Perhaps most importantly, we saw a significant reduction in suicidal ideation in many participants within 24 hours, and those effects were still present months later. This suggests that DMT-assisted therapy might offer fast-acting relief, which could be especially valuable in urgent clinical situations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these results are encouraging, the study has limitations. It was open-label, meaning both participants and researchers knew they were receiving DMT, which raises the possibility of placebo effects. The sample size was small, and the findings need to be confirmed in larger randomized controlled trials. In addition, the researchers did not collect pharmacokinetic data to measure how much DMT was actually absorbed, which limits conclusions about dose-response relationships. Some participants had minor fluctuations in symptoms over time, and one experienced a relapse in suicidality, underscoring the need for follow-up care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a Phase 2a open-label study, without a placebo group, and the number of participants was small,” De Araujo noted. “We have to be cautious in how we interpret the results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to compare DMT directly with placebo or other treatments, test repeated dosing regimens, and examine how integration sessions contribute to long-term outcomes. Better understanding how individual differences—such as prior psychedelic use, expectations, or co-occurring medication—affect results will also help tailor treatments. Monitoring for rare but serious side effects, including cardiovascular changes, will be essential as researchers scale up trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the beginning, our goal has been to develop a model of psychedelic-assisted therapy that fits within clinical, ethical, and economic boundaries,” De Araujo explained. “We believe that treatments that are overly long or expensive will face serious obstacles when it comes to integration into health systems, especially in countries like Brazil, where resources are limited and access is a real concern. In that sense, the vaporized DMT protocol we designed seems to strike a promising balance: it’s efficient, potentially scalable, and still therapeutically meaningful. Going forward, we aim to refine this model and test it in larger, controlled trials, always with a focus on safety, accessibility, and real-world feasibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is part of a larger movement, one that’s challenging old assumptions and inviting us to reimagine mental health care through the lens of altered states of consciousness. Psychedelics are not a magic bullet, but they can offer powerful tools when approached with scientific rigor, cultural sensitivity, and genuine care for the human experience. It’s been incredibly meaningful to witness how these experiences can reconnect people with themselves, and sometimes even bring hope back into view.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-025-02091-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rapid and sustained antidepressant effects of vaporized N,N-dimethyltryptamine: A phase 2a clinical trial in treatment-resistant depression&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Marcelo Falchi-Carvalho, Fernanda Palhano-Fontes, Isabel Wießner, Handersson Barros, Raynara Bolcont, Sophie Laborde, Sérgio Ruschi B.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucid dreaming&lt;/strong&gt;, the phenomenon where dreamers become aware they are dreaming and can influence their dreams, is now recognized as a distinct state of &lt;strong&gt;consciousness&lt;/strong&gt;. Research led by &lt;strong&gt;Çağatay Demirel&lt;/strong&gt; from the Donders Center for Cognitive Neuroimaging at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands reveals that lucid dreaming is neither &lt;strong&gt;fully&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;wakefulness&lt;/strong&gt; nor typical &lt;strong&gt;REM sleep&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, it involves unique &lt;strong&gt;brain wave&lt;/strong&gt; patterns and neural activity that set it apart. This new understanding was published recently in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/45/20/e2237242025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and represents one of the most comprehensive analyses to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Brain Regions and Waves Behind Lucid Awareness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By analyzing an extensive collection of &lt;strong&gt;EEG&lt;/strong&gt; data from multiple studies, Demirel and his team identified &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/drinking-less-of-this-one-beverage-could-lower-your-dementia-risk-and-its-not-coffee/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="88533" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;specific brain regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; linked to lucid dreaming. The right central lobe, &lt;strong&gt;parietal lobe&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;precuneus&lt;/strong&gt; all showed shifts in electrical activity during lucid dreams. &lt;strong&gt;Beta waves&lt;/strong&gt;—high-frequency brain waves associated with conscious thinking, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/dinosaurs-closest-relatives-prove-they-can-think-study-finds-dumb-birds-are-actually-problem-solvers/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80208" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;problem-solving&lt;/a&gt;, and decision-making—became prominent in the right temporal and parietal lobes. These areas are crucial for spatial awareness, nonverbal memory, and self-perception, explaining why lucid dreamers can recognize they are dreaming and exert cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside beta waves, &lt;strong&gt;gamma waves&lt;/strong&gt;, which are the fastest brain waves, also increased, particularly in the right precuneus. This brain area plays a key role in self-referential thinking—the process of reflecting on oneself. “When lucid dreaming begins, gamma waves increase in the right precuneus,” Demirel said, highlighting this neural signature as a hallmark of conscious awareness within dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Connectivity Patterns Distinguish Lucid Dreaming From REM Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study went beyond localized brain activity to explore&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/mouse-brain-map-compared-to-galaxy/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="85804" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;functional connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the communication between different brain regions—during lucid dreaming. Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;alpha band&lt;/strong&gt; connectivity (8–12 Hz) increased significantly during lucid dreaming compared to non-lucid REM sleep. Furthermore, interhemispheric and inter-regional gamma connectivity rose, suggesting widespread network engagement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the source level, the right central and parietal areas, including the temporoparietal junction, showed significant reductions in beta power during lucid dreaming. These neural dynamics reflect the complex processes underpinning changes in perception, &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/red-meat-may-be-destroying-your-memory/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76105" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, and self-awareness. During initial signaling by lucid dreamers using eye movements, gamma1 power (30–36 Hz) spiked in the right temporo-occipital regions, further illustrating the brain’s dynamic engagement in this unique state.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Parallels Between Lucid Dreaming and Psychedelic Experiences&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the brain activity observed during lucid dreaming resembles patterns seen with &lt;strong&gt;psychedelic&lt;/strong&gt; drugs such as LSD and ayahuasca. Both experiences involve alterations in the precuneus, a region critical to the sense of self and ego processing. However, while psychedelics often lead to a dissolution of ego and reduced self-referential processing, lucid dreaming appears to “harness elements of self-awareness and control,” as noted by Demirel and his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This comparison underscores lucid dreaming as an intriguing and complex mode of consciousness. It provides an altered but conscious state in which the dreamer maintains cognitive control and self-awareness, distinguishing it from both typical REM sleep and psychedelic-induced states.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Decoding Consciousness Through the Study of Lucid Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of lucid dreaming and help establish it as an independent state of consciousness. By pooling&lt;strong&gt; human EEG data&lt;/strong&gt; from multiple labs and applying an adaptive multistage preprocessing pipeline, Demirel’s team overcame previous challenges like small sample sizes and artifacts from eye movements. This rigorous approach allowed them to detect subtle yet distinct neural signatures at both sensor and source levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study advances understanding of how perception, memory, self-awareness, and cognitive control shift during lucid dreaming. As Demirel remarked, “This research opens the door to a deeper understanding of lucid dreaming as an intricate state of consciousness by pointing to the possibility that conscious experience can arise from within sleep itself.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder that causes abnormal breathing patterns as you sleep, like pauses in your breath. These interruptions can lead to fragmented sleep, excessive daytime fatigue, and if undiagnosed, it can cause serious long-term health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), where the airway becomes blocked during sleep, and central sleep apnea (CSA), which occurs when the brain fails to send the right signals to the muscles that control breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31300334/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31300334/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one billion people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; around the world suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. Although central sleep apnea isn’t as common, it’s more prevalent in those who suffer from other health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve spoken to leading sleep specialists and medical professionals to deep dive into the symptoms and causes of both types of sleep apnea. We’ve also looked at how to tackle them and when you should consult your GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-sleep-apnea-3"&gt;What is sleep apnea?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otolaryngologist and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.azvent.com/providers/jordan-weiner/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.azvent.com/providers/jordan-weiner/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sleep surgeon Jordan Weiner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explains that sleep apnea is a common sleep disorder characterised by “intermittent reductions in breathing, including complete pauses in breathing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During these pauses, oxygen levels in the blood drop. In the long run, sleep apnea can lead to several heart conditions, diabetes, a higher risk of stroke, and even dementia,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are two types of the condition, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/obstructive-sleep-apnea" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/obstructive-sleep-apnea"&gt;obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; is when breathing interruptions are “due to collapse of the throat, preventing airflow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GgbWj2DGmDZ5NGfDsrGPxU" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GgbWj2DGmDZ5NGfDsrGPxU slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These collapses can occur "in several different areas, including the soft palate, side walls of the throat, back of the tongue, and even in the upper voice box (larynx).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While in central sleep apnea (CSA), it's down to the central nervous system failing. “The brain fails to tell the muscles of breathing to take a breath, leading to a temporary pause in breathing, while there is no collapse in the throat." Dr Weiner explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CSA is also associated with those who have had strokes, kidney problems or heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-apnea-symptoms" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-apnea-symptoms"&gt;Symptoms of sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; can include loud snoring, interrupted sleep and daytime sleepiness. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698527" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5698527" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Studies show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that if the condition goes undiagnosed, it could lead to more serious health implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with untreated sleep apnea have an increased risk of having high blood pressure, which in turn can increase their risk of heart problems and strokes," explains Dr Bhavini Shah, a GP from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/uk/our-clinical-team/dr-bhavini-shah" target="_blank" data-url="https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/uk/our-clinical-team/dr-bhavini-shah" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some people with sleep apnea are also at higher risk of type 2 diabetes,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-obstructive-sleep-apnea"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id="symptoms-of-osa-3"&gt;Symptoms of OSA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loud snoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disrupted breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interrupted sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headaches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dry mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daytime tiredness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mood swings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been woken up by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/causes-of-snoring-and-treatments" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/causes-of-snoring-and-treatments"&gt;loud snoring&lt;/a&gt; from your partner, along with disrupted breathing during the night, it could be a sign they have obstructive sleep apnea, says Professor Esther Rodriguez Villegas, a sleep apnea expert and founder of medtech startup &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://acurable.com/en-us" target="_blank" data-url="https://acurable.com/en-us" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Acurable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people with OSA wake up gasping or choking, while bed partners often report loud snoring or breathing pauses," she adds.

A diagnosis of this sleep apnea type is made when there is a pause in breathing for at least 10 seconds, five times per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are other symptoms to look out for, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While central sleep apnea shares many of the same symptoms as OSA, such as disrupted sleep, daytime fatigue, and morning headaches, it typically lacks the hallmark loud snoring seen in obstructive cases,” says Rodriguez Villegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She adds this is because, “the problem stems from the brain’s control of breathing, the breathing pauses tend to be quieter and may go unnoticed without monitoring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="causes-of-csa-3"&gt;Causes of CSA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central sleep apnea (CSA) is less common as it's a neurological issue, rather than to do with your airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated with a fault in the brain, it fails to control breathing as you sleep. Other health conditions can also cause CSA, including heart conditions, strokes and high altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tends to mean older people, 60 and up, are diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cause of central sleep apnea is not always apparent,” explains Dr Weiner, “Conditions that increase risk for central sleep apnea include heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure, a history of stroke, kidney failure, and living at high altitude.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-tackle-csa-3"&gt;How to tackle CSA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because central sleep apnea is usually linked to underlying medical conditions, treatment can be more complex than for obstructive sleep apnea, says Rodriguez Villegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Approaches may include respiratory stimulants, oxygen therapy, the use of positive airway pressure (PAP) devices, or medications that help regulate the brain’s control of breathing," Villegaz explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The appropriate strategy depends heavily on the patient’s overall health profile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, lifestyle changes can help to tackle the condition, similar to obstructive sleep apnea. “&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/mattresses/how-to-exercise-for-better-sleep-according-to-doctors"&gt;Regular exercise&lt;/a&gt; can also help to reduce symptoms as well as help you maintain a healthy weight,” explains Dr Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While adopting good sleep habits, also known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/what-is-sleep-hygiene-tips-and-habits" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/what-is-sleep-hygiene-tips-and-habits"&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;, is also important for both, “Make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet, and go to bed and wake up at the same time each day”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleeping on your side can also help to naturally open up your airways.

Home sleep apnea tests utilise a small monitor that the patient wears at home during sleep,” explains Weiner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he adds: “In-laboratory studies called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-cycles" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/sleep-cycles"&gt;polysomnography&lt;/a&gt; (PSG) are the most accurate test of sleep disorders and remain the ‘gold standard’ for sleep apnea testing.”&lt;/p&gt;

But it often takes a bit of detective work to determine what, exactly, is causing these symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Abnormalities in blood pressure — including blood pressure that’s either too high or too low — can cause dizziness. Some people will experience heart palpitations, or extra heartbeats, that can trigger lightheadedness, Oen-Hsiao said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though many arrhythmias are benign and triggered by factors like caffeine or menopause, some irregular heartbeats — including those that occur at the bottom of the heart chamber — can be a sign of heart disease or a blockage in the heart arteries, according to Oen-Hsiao. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: FG Trade via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;FG Trade via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Neurological symptoms like headaches and dizziness could be a sign of cardiovascular problems.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bad Headache &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A severe headache may be a marker that something’s amiss with the heart. A frontal headache with pain that shoots across the forehead and behind the eyes can indicate that a person has high blood pressure, according to Oen-Hsiao.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Some people don’t feel their blood pressure, but at one point, it gets a little too much blood pressure for their brain to handle and then they’ll get that frontal headache and pain behind the eyes,” Oen-Hsiao said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;High blood pressure resulting in a headache can be urgent issue, Tadwalkar said.

When the heart begins to fail, fluid can accumulate in the legs and belly. When the gut fills with fluid, it doesn’t absorb nutrients as well, causing people to lose their appetite and feel full all of the time, Oen-Hsiao said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Occasionally, nausea and upset stomach are the only symptoms that patients with a blockage in the back artery of the heart will feel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A lot of patients who have a heart attack with the artery in the back part of the heart, they actually won’t have chest pain or shortness of breath, they’ll just get really nauseous and feel sick to their stomach,” Oen-Hsiao said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Jaw Pain And Tightness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some people with cardiovascular issues will experience jaw pain and heaviness that radiates up the neck, into the jaw and down into the left arm.

It is called interval walking, that is, alternating 3 minutes of slow walking with 3 minutes of brisk walking, like you are rushing to an important meeting. Do this for 30 minutes daily, and the results are impressive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that, when compared to the 10,000 steps a day, the IWT can improve blood pressure, reduce stroke risk, improve mood, boost immunity and offer better sleep quality. “Studies show that this method can improve cardiovascular health and fitness significantly,” he points out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To start, walk at a comfortable pace for 3-5 minutes, then alternate slow and brisk walking. Finish with a 3-5 minute cool down. It is joint friendly, time efficient and very effective. Share this widely and follow for more,” the doctor suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 10:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxPT25uWEtZLUQwU0llaU1sckZ0Z0pxQ2trZ2ktZmE3ZDZTLXd5Und5SmhQZXB2OW1tTzVVREFlczF6dEZWTTE0Q3VmeEdHUEQ1LTRvUF9GNDJGQm02bDRwOTh3cjV2R1lZODYxTXFma1JJd01uY0hqZmNUa0tjWnpWdHIyTGhwZ2NYTEhOd3hlUmU0VkdELWdjRTZjbkdBaEdpbldIVEFKQnVCN2NrQ1RFVTNSR3hvbVZIelVFSjVFQm5BdW15RlpTZEJlbmhHekZ3MTc0YU9oUWFHb3N6eGRhdlo4VzRaLTZnVFUwUEREekZuNk44MGpUMzZWZG1Tcl9Cb0JzXzhtZk5Gc1V6eXVTOUo2YXQ</guid></item><item><title>中风可能会产生重大影响-《纽约时报》 | A Ministroke Can Have Major Consequences - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1Wa1l5c2JOQzdwVWxNYXpqVmVTR2xaN2Q4dUtjTVl6SnZIUlRia2FSMTFPQl8zQU82ZkdsN3ZJdTJIOXU4V3BaVEpGQnRDbUlkbmpQaDVkeXZrZVVwcVZ3U1NYTWR3U2JFSkZfVm10YWI5YVU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Kristin Kramer woke up early on a Tuesday morning 10 years ago because one of her dogs needed to go out.

At least &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15731465/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;240,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; experience one each year, with the incidence &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7838926/#H1-3-JOI200138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;increasing sharply with age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Because the symptoms disappear quickly, usually within minutes, people don’t seek immediate treatment, putting them at high risk for a bigger stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Kramer felt some arm tingling over the next couple of days and saw her doctor, who found nothing alarming on a CT scan. But then she started “jumbling” her words and finally had a relative drive her to an emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;A study from earlier this year showed that staying active can keep your brain healthier&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sustaining physical activity throughout midlife also seems to have the best effect on reducing dementia risk,” the charity explains. One study showed that older people who exercised the least were more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as the ones who exercised the most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new study performed by scientists from University College London, published earlier this year, looked at &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; data from more than 450 people since their birth in 1946. The researchers analysed how physical activity patterns over three decades impacted brain health at the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/physical-activity-and-dementia-risk/" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/a&gt; found that being physically active, particularly before the age of 50, is linked to a larger hippocampus - which is the area of the brain mostly associated with memory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who exercised throughout their life were less likely to experience cognitive decline, even if they had key markers of Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that staying active throughout your life, especially before turning 50, can help keep your brain healthy and delay early signs of Alzheimer's.

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;A study from earlier this year showed that staying active can keep your brain healthier&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sustaining physical activity throughout midlife also seems to have the best effect on reducing dementia risk,” the charity explains. One study showed that older people who exercised the least were more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as the ones who exercised the most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new study performed by scientists from University College London, published earlier this year, looked at &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/health" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; data from more than 450 people since their birth in 1946. The researchers analysed how physical activity patterns over three decades impacted brain health at the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/dementia-risk/physical-activity-and-dementia-risk/" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/a&gt; found that being physically active, particularly before the age of 50, is linked to a larger hippocampus - which is the area of the brain mostly associated with memory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who exercised throughout their life were less likely to experience cognitive decline, even if they had key markers of Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that staying active throughout your life, especially before turning 50, can help keep your brain healthy and delay early signs of Alzheimer's. This is especially true for women,” the study’s lead author, Dr Sarah-Naomi James, said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tips to get more exercise include choosing an activity that you will enjoy, or using workout videos for motivation, &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/physical-activity" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Society advised. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also suggested using a wearable device like a fitness tracker watch, or a smartphone app like the &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; Couch to 5K to track progress, and joining a group activity like hiking as it is a “great way to connect and interact with people”. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; “Being active doesn’t have to involve going to the gym or running a marathon.

This is because typically, there are no obvious symptoms until it results in severe health issues like a heart attack or stroke.

The study showed that these juicy berries may help delay cognitive decline and protect against dementia and Alzheimer’s due to their flavonoids, keeping the brain sharp as we age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;How do strawberries and polyphenols affect the heart?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strawberries are a good source of polyphenols, particularly anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and ellagitannins. These are all types of antioxidants, granting a number of cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Polyphenols help increase 'good' cholesterol (HDL) and decrease the 'bad' kind (LDL), contributing to a healthier overall cholesterol balance. This 'good' cholesterol is needed in balance to help with crucial bodily functions, &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/medical/tests/blood-cholesterol" rel="nofollow"&gt;according to the British Heart Foundation (BHF)&lt;/a&gt;, such as the production of hormones and vitamin D, as well as helping with digestion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Polyphenols also help to reduce inflammation in blood vessels, further protecting our hearts from serious and potentially fatal problems like a heart attack or stroke. Some studies suggest that polyphenols can help regulate blood pressure, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840535/" rel="nofollow"&gt;according to a research paper on the NIH website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What about strawberries and brain health?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plant compounds called flavonoids in strawberries may help to offset inflammation in the brain and delay age-related memory loss, potentially reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s in older adults. Strawberries are one of the most abundant natural sources of pelargonidin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that these compounds may help reduce the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's Disease. The bioactive compound has been associated with "fewer neurofibrillary tau tangles" in the brain - one of the major signs of Alzheimer’s disease that accumulate in the brain, &lt;a href="https://www.j-alz.com/content/strawberries-may-fend-alzheimers" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;according to the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As promising as the research on strawberries is for warding off health issues like high cholesterol and cognitive decline, it is not a magic solution.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even for those who are not allergic, overeating strawberries could lead to digestive issues because of their high fibre content. Also, strawberries contain goitrogens, compounds that may interfere with thyroid function, so those with a thyroid condition should also keep their intake to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strawberries are low in calories compared to other fruits, making them an excellent choice for a simple snack or when incorporated as part of a meal. Eating just seven berries counts as one of the easiest ways to stack up on more berries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of their sweetness, most people &lt;a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/strawberry-smoothie" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;blend strawberries into smoothies&lt;/a&gt; or top other desserts with them, such as yoghurt or ice cream. &lt;a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/turkey-strawberry-avocado-salad" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;You could also use them in salads for a refreshing summer twist&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;Experts say that brighter strawberries have more of these beneficial nutrients inside&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even for those who are not allergic, overeating strawberries could lead to digestive issues because of their high fibre content. Also, strawberries contain goitrogens, compounds that may interfere with thyroid function, so those with a thyroid condition should also keep their intake to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strawberries are low in calories compared to other fruits, making them an excellent choice for a simple snack or when incorporated as part of a meal. Eating just seven berries counts as one of the easiest ways to stack up on more berries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of their sweetness, most people &lt;a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/strawberry-smoothie" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;blend strawberries into smoothies&lt;/a&gt; or top other desserts with them, such as yoghurt or ice cream. &lt;a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/turkey-strawberry-avocado-salad" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;You could also use them in salads for a refreshing summer twist&lt;/a&gt;. Breakfast may also be a good time to get your strawberry fix in. They make great topping choices for pancakes and porridge.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOSDYtTW9pLTRLMFlOQmwtVm0yNFU3LUdCbGtRYktsU0MtTm1MMEVobjdvMjI2M1pSWlhUaWlIdDFPZ2JQeWJJTHFuM1VpejJZZWRtMGZ2U05oTElaZVpacjBMMGtHZi1vUXpWVDNMZ0ZwTmlMdExzS2I2ZS1nT1BfZ3hIUdIBiAFBVV95cUxOYU1FM2lraUw3elpra3FHazk4YzBManZJRlBZaEl5ckhUYzQ5aGV4aE0wR0dSSTJKWlFRVGIxTk1DNTNOa3JtUXY4bVBYZGZTV3NOcWNjNWxRaDBiRlMxZUNZZjFOSlB6TzcxeW40VjZFSllCT0NCb01DVUk1djF2cUVnMHRUZUMw</guid></item><item><title>前配偶联手进行肾脏互换以挽救生命- KOLO | 8新闻 | Ex-spouses team up in kidney swap to save lives - KOLO | 8 News Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPUzFKcVBkWHJQdUJVamFUZ1dNUWxpMWNIcFlnRjZjYUtMNEs5QW8tR0xycmw0RWZkVUhtLU0zNlc2RWJLODNJY1NlNnJmTjRRTUxsUWFMZnV2ZklwYmZhSG5VbzVSZmJld1JTa3pDOW1rekc5akMzcHRjWW5ybWdieDlR0gGWAUFVX3lxTE1pSlBjZjdQek40bUNXeG5CMFRZRGtoVHB4ZkZLY2xObWx4RDltY3QzazdJMDBKRXJ0NWlxMjZPRjJjdFdmdHdpNVV5NDNWRG5XLUdRS1Vmd1JaX0dZZnV3N0RyU3FYekFVNG05Tmd0Xy1VTi1URVZYeWs0WWtTSU1FRHhCVGNtLWRnWGI4SFl5a0NkUkpTZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;RENO, Nev. (KOLO) - In just two weeks, Gary Hauser of Reno will receive a life-saving kidney transplant. The donor making it possible is his ex-wife, Gigi Hauser. But in a surprising twist, she won’t be donating her kidney to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Instead, the two are part of a paired kidney exchange. It’s a process that matches two incompatible donor-recipient pairs with each other to “swap” organs, allowing each recipient to get the kidney they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The story began when Gary went in for routine bloodwork two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I got a call from a frantic doctor,” Gary said. “He couldn’t say much because it was on a voicemail, but I thought he must have mixed my bloodwork up with someone else because I felt fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;But the results were accurate: Gary’s kidney function was down to 17%. He was immediately placed on the deceased donor list, where he waited for two years without finding a match. During that time, Gigi stepped forward to be tested as a potential donor. While she was a partial match, the size difference between the two created a major hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“There are 12 different factors they look at,” Gigi explained. “And I only hit on 6,” Gary added. “The biggest issue is that I’m twice her size. If I took her kidney, I’d be back in 10 years for another transplant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;That’s when doctors recommended the paired exchange program. Shortly after enrolling, Gary and Gigi were matched with another donor-recipient pair from Tennessee. In late May, Gigi will donate her kidney to a stranger, and in return, Gary will receive a compatible kidney from that stranger’s loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“The cool thing about a paired exchange is that you’re taking two people off the deceased donor list,” said Gigi. “That makes room for everybody else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Since Reno hospitals aren’t equipped to handle paired exchanges, the surgery will take place in Salt Lake City. Afterward, Gary will need to stay in Utah for six weeks so doctors can monitor him closely for signs of organ rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“My body, for the rest of my life, will be fighting the kidney,” Gary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Despite the risks, Gigi said the decision to donate was never a question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“You have to be your own motivator,” she said. “Because you lose a lot of battles when you start doubting yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;As for whether the experience has brought them closer, Gary doesn’t hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s definitely strengthened our bond,” Gary said. “Hell yeah.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Gary and Gigi have launched a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/join-garys-kidney-transplant-journey?attribution_id=sl:256d3e54-912f-4339-af3c-a1ba5523eabb&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help cover travel and medical expenses during their recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 KOLO.
