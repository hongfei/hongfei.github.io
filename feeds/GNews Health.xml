They also have a higher risk of a late-stage diagnosis compared with their white counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prostate Cancer UK highlighted the apparent “postcode lottery” with regard to testing and diagnoses of the disease. It found that rates of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing were highest in the south-east of England and lowest in the north-west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Men living in areas of higher deprivation were 29% more likely to be diagnosed with cancer that had spread than those living in more affluent areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Chiara De Biase, the director of health services, equity and improvement at Prostate Cancer UK, said risk awareness campaigns had played a big part in the overall increase, which had led to “more men than ever being diagnosed and treated”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in the UK, but despite this, men are facing deeply unfair inequities across the country, and their experiences vary hugely based on where they live,” De Biase said. “We urgently need an early detection programme that will address these regional inequities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="470ecd2a-63ac-4586-b5ed-e0f666448292" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":9,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"NHS expands access to prostate cancer drug in England to save thousands of lives","elementId":"470ecd2a-63ac-4586-b5ed-e0f666448292","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/16/prostate-cancer-drug-abiraterone-nhs-england"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isInStarRatingVariant":false}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added: “Mass risk-awareness campaigns have played a big part in causing this increase, such as how in February 2022, we launched a national campaign with the NHS to reach men across the UK to get them to check their risk of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also know that when celebrities like Bill Turnbull, Nick Owen and Colin McFarlane share their prostate cancer stories, men can be encouraged to ask about a test themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last year, prostate cancer became &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/28/prostate-cancer-becomes-most-common-cancer-diagnosis-in-england" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the most common cancer in England&lt;/a&gt;, but new figures from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland enabled the UK-wide analysis. In Scotland there were 5,608 prostate cancer diagnoses, an increase of 30% compared with previous figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ian Walker, the executive director of policy at Cancer Research UK, said that the figures could be affected by overdiagnosis of the disease, “where PSA tests in asymptomatic men could be spotting cancers that wouldn’t cause any harm”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A panel of expert government health advisers in November said prostate cancer screening &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/nov/28/prostate-cancer-screening-not-expected-to-be-made-widely-available-in-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;should not be made available&lt;/a&gt; to the vast majority of men across the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The UK National Screening Committee instead recommended that there should be a targeted screening programme for men with a confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 faulty gene variant, which means they are more at risk of faster growing and aggressive cancers at an earlier age. Men in that category could be screened every two years between the ages of 45 and 61, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is despite campaigners and charities calling for men at higher risk of developing the disease, such as black men and those with a family history of the cancer, to have screening available to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “We are determined to improve outcomes for men with prostate cancer, and we know that too many men in deprived communities are being diagnosed at a later stage when the disease is harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Last week the NHS expanded access to abiraterone – a treatment that can significantly improve survival rates and give patients precious extra years of life and we are also making progress on cutting cancer waiting times – in the last 12 months, 213,000 more patients received a diagnosis for suspected cancer on time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOUkM3bWR3RXlmMTd4aWtFYUw5NXFpT094NHVINXpDN0ZEZGp4MnJXREI3VXZCU2lYcWVoTFkyQ2tKMVZEX2F4WWVtRV9vbzE4WGh3aElZMTFVYlBzc3BhOXBpOFlYZGs1VlA1M1Q0YXVsbHdPX3JtMV9GTzJfNm51OTBtVXpmTXFhYTFvbm1WV0ZpN0NGSjhrLUt6SGE0RmgwYmFTUlh2Z29kcFhjYmttS2h4T0NXZllSTzA4</guid></item><item><title>拥有“黄金之心”的21岁里格比男子在意外死亡后继续祝福他人-东爱达荷新闻</title><link>https://www.eastidahonews.com/2026/01/21-year-old-rigby-man-who-had-a-heart-of-gold-continues-to-bless-others-after-unexpected-death/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleText"&gt; &lt;p&gt;RIGBY — A Rigby man, remembered for the selfless life he lived, was able to bless others through organ donation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Noel Rios, who went by the name Titus Freeman, died on the evening of Oct. 19, 2025, at the age of 21. He was riding his dirt bike — he’s been riding since he was three years old — when he was involved in a crash with a truck half a mile from his home in Rigby. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He was most likely killed on impact,” Janice Bell, who is Freeman’s aunt, told EastIdahoNews.com. “He had a helmet and all his riding gear on, and it didn’t save him.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Oct. 13, just days before the accident, Freeman turned 21. Bell said her nephew’s best friend, who is in his late 60s, told him he needed to get a “big boy license” since he was now 21. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He took Friday off to go get his new drivers license … and he thought to himself (and told his mom), ‘I’m an adult now, I should be a donor.’ He wasn’t a donor before,” Bell explained. “When he went down there (to renew his license), he became a donor. That was Friday, and he was killed Sunday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the accident, Freeman was rushed to Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, where his family was told he wouldn’t survive. The hospital found out he was a donor, and he was taken to the Intensive Care Unit and put on life support. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A donor honor walk took place Oct. 22, where Freeman, who had been declared brain dead, was wheeled down to the operating room as family, friends, coworkers and hospital employees lined the hallways. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to Freeman’s decision to become a donor, he helped save the lives of seven other people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His heart went to another 21-year-old boy in Utah,” Bell, who said she hopes that person goes on to “do great things,” explained. “We don’t know much about his other ones (like) his kidneys and lungs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital.jpeg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital.jpeg" alt="Titus Freeman in hospital." class="alignnone size-full wp-image-804998" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital.jpeg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital-860x478.jpeg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-Freeman-in-hospital-600x333.jpeg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Freeman not only helped others as a donor but also by giving freely and serving those around him, which he did throughout his life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Freeman worked for Knife River in Idaho Falls at the time of his death. Bell mentioned that he led a crew of men twice his age, and he’d get to work at 5 a.m. to start everybody’s machines so they’d be warm for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He gave his whole crew lunch money (and gas money) all the time,” she said. “When he passed away, they all paid him back in his front loader (that) was his machine. It was full of money.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Freeman, who was born in Caldwell, has one older and one younger sister. Bell said Freeman had a challenging childhood, but he rose above it. At 19, he decided to buy a house in Rigby for his mom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She not only loved him — every parent has a favorite, I don’t care what they say. If they say they don’t, they lie — but Titus, the reason he was her favorite is he also loved her the most,” Bell said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Freeman was a gifted baseball player who enjoyed playing disc golf and going fishing. When he was 12, he rebuilt a snowmobile, and most recently, he was rebuilding the engine in his truck. He got his truck running the day of his accident, but he never got a chance to drive it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He was such a good boy. Never in trouble in his life,” Bell recalled. “He didn’t go out drinking. He was in bed by 8 or 9. We call him the old man of the family. He was an anomaly.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bell said losing her nephew was “the worst thing possible,” but she is proud of the lives he was able to save. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You don’t have to be religious, or you can be, but God — if there is a God — he did this. This must have been part of his plan … of some plan,” she said. “I guess he had a plan for my beautiful, sweet nephew.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Freeman will be honored in Utah this summer when his name is added to “The Celebration of Life Monument.” The &lt;a href="https://www.donorconnect.life/celebration-of-life-monument/"&gt;monument is a memorial and tribute&lt;/a&gt; to individuals both living and deceased that have donated organs, tissue, and eyes for either transplant or research in the intermountain area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom.jpeg" class="fancybox"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom.jpeg" alt="Titus freeman and mom" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-805001" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom.jpeg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-300x233.jpeg 300w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-768x597.jpeg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-860x669.jpeg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-643x500.jpeg 643w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Titus-freeman-and-mom-600x467.jpeg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Titus Freeman with his mom. | Courtesy photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Maybe this will be the year I finally start meal planning or doing morning pages. New year, new me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what if the thing we needed more of was to do less? What if this was the year we finally learned to rest?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We all involuntarily participate in the stress Olympics, and are aware that the busiest person wins gold,” says Amelia Nagoski, co-author of &lt;a href="https://www.burnoutbook.net/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a culture that glamorizes hard work, sacrifice and the grind, rest is often seen as self-indulgent and lazy, Nagoski says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not only does this attitude leave us worn out, it’s counterproductive. “Rest is what helps us function at our highest level of capacity,” says Dr &lt;a href="https://www.drdaltonsmith.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Saundra Dalton-Smith&lt;/a&gt;, a physician and &lt;a href="https://www.drdaltonsmith.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;author&lt;/a&gt; of Sacred Rest. Although many people are accustomed to pushing through feelings of tiredness, doing so generally results in a lower quality of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So why not start this year more energized and less depleted? Here’s how to start resting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-rest" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Rest is anything that gives you more energy,” says Nagoski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This doesn’t necessarily mean a cessation of activities, she adds: “Sometimes, it’s just doing different things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Indeed, the most restorative rest is often more active than passive, argues Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, author of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/22/alex-soojung-kim-pang-interview-rest-why-you-get-more-done-when-you-work-less" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“That’s not to say there’s anything wrong with sitting on the couch with a bag of salty snacks in one hand and the TV remote in another,” he says. “But the things that deliver the biggest restorative bang for your buck are things like going for a walk, spending time in nature or exercising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-biggest-obstacles-to-rest" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest obstacles to rest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If a twisted scientist were to sit down and invent a society designed to de-legitimize rest, it would look a lot like ours, says Pang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We all come with decades of cultural programming that tells us that in order to succeed, we have to spend enormous amounts of time at work,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is another, more personal obstacle: many people don’t know what kind of rest they need. As we’ll see below, there are many ways to catch a break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="take-rest-seriously" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take rest seriously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So you’re finally open to throwing off the yoke of overwork. But how does one actually incorporate more rest into their lives? If you’ve read this far, that’s a good start. “If you’re asking this question, you’re taking rest seriously,” says Pang. “That’s the first thing you’ve got to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="look-at-how-you-work" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at how you work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you are in a job that allows you to have some control over your schedule, Pang suggests combining periods of deep, focused work – 90 minutes to two hours – with breaks of about half an hour. The break could be running errands, going for a walk or having lunch – anything that’s not work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"index":19,"listId":6039,"identityName":"well-actually","description":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life","name":"Well Actually","frequency":"Weekly","successDescription":"You are subscribed","theme":"lifestyle","idApiUrl":"https://idapi.theguardian.com","hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers":true}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"220f3eea-5cec-4929-85b5-c137a93f8211","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="220f3eea-5cec-4929-85b5-c137a93f8211" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If your job does not have a predictable schedule, Pang recommends better preserving nights and weekends.

Eventually, she realized the rest she needed was emotional, because the amount of energy required to appear calm in the face of horrible situations was leaving her depleted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Drawing on Dalton-Smith’s work, the &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/mental-health/seven-rest-types" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt; put together examples of how to practice the seven types of rest:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Physical rest: making sure you get enough sleep; taking naps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Mental rest: journaling; meditating; doing tasks that are not mentally taxing, like puzzles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Emotional rest: talking through feelings and experiences with a friend or therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Social rest: setting aside time alone to recharge; making sure you’re spending time with people who don’t leave you feeling drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sensory rest: spending time outdoors; taking breaks from screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Creative rest: engaging in creative hobbies like drawing, reading or dancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Spiritual rest: connecting to a cause or tradition that feels meaningful to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id="enlist-others-for-help" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist others for help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Perhaps the most important and effective way to incorporate more rest into your life is to recruit other people in your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nagoski explains that she and her twin sister, sex educator and researcher Emily Nagoski, were inspired to write Burnout together after Amelia ended up in an emergency room with stress-induced illness. “My sister drove two-and-a-half hours to the hospital and fed me a big stack of journal articles about rest and the importance of overcoming burnout,” Nagoski says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts agree this kind of care and support – reminding loved ones that their wellbeing is more important than work – is essential to pushing back against a culture of overwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“All these external pressures to sacrifice and give everything you have to give – it’s like a rushing river,” Nagoski says. “If you try to stand against it alone, you’re going to get washed away really fast. But if you surround yourself with people who care about your wellbeing as much as you care about theirs, you can all stand together, and that’s the only way to resist the river.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE81ZW5CRVU1ZUY3RjFHZU9aamJWZ2F1LVJlNGNvWE8ydllyRWJEVVdsd1J0SE1qVkczRmVlUlBZNmNXS2Y1azdUV2NZeGhDWU1XNk90ZjhsR0RHT05vRlFNNm5FVENxdTZVRnZKMExmNi1TaTBTSkhyeg</guid></item><item><title>安慰剂效应影响疫苗反应-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04168-7</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="ethics-content"&gt;

And, while animal studies suggest that activating the brain’s reward system can boost immune defences, the picture in humans has been less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04140-5" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt;, healthy volunteers took part in brain training sessions in which they tried different mental strategies to boost activity in particular parts of the brain. They knew how well they were doing thanks to real-time feedback in the form of scores that rose in line with brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After four training sessions, the volunteers were given a hepatitis B vaccine. They then gave blood two and four weeks later, which researchers analysed for antibodies against hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The scientists found that people who boosted activity in part of the brain’s reward system called the ventral tegmental area (VTA) had the strongest immune response to the vaccine. Those who boosted it most successfully did so through positive expectations, or imagining good things happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The effect may prove useful in boosting patients’ immune systems, but larger trials are needed to show if there is any clear medical benefit. Dr Tamar Koren, a co-author, said the team was investigating whether other parts of the immune system were also affected, such as that responsible for inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;index&amp;quot;:10,&amp;quot;listId&amp;quot;:4156,&amp;quot;identityName&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;morning-briefing&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;First Edition&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frequency&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We'll send you First Edition every weekday&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;theme&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;news&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;idApiUrl&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&amp;quot;:true}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The approach we tested is intended solely as a complementary tool that may enhance immune responsiveness to vaccination,” said Dr Nitzan Lubianiker, a senior author on the study. “It cannot, and is not meant to, replace vaccines or standard medical care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jonathan Kipnis, a professor of pathology and immunology at Washington University in St Louis, agreed. “It is probably too early to draw conclusions about the degree of clinical relevance,” he said. “If such effects were shown to matter clinically in a larger clinical trial, they would most likely complement the established treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jeremy Howick, a professor of empathic healthcare at the University of Leicester, said the effect was small and cautioned that sick patients in a clinic may respond differently, but he still saw positives. He said: “Given that it’s free for healthcare professionals to say things that can generate positive expectations, without exaggerating, like: ‘We’re going to do our best to take care of you,’ or: ‘I’ve seen this treatment work for people like you,’ this is a pretty robust signal suggesting we should do more of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQZzRCSVd5bURqUFVoZEZud01CRm9ORGtIOXd2RFlnTlE3TkRUZGJra01aajMtclR6TFdlNGlUVGs4dFJDWFdjWHVIeTgwRkRtR1BORlV5NXUzLWNkaExZZDlwUVJlb21XWlBWYmxGUU9VLWxvWFRnSGNZQ1M3b00yTXFyMldjQ1lpRUdWNHo1Q2RraEYxU1NLdHVJWXM0V3d5YVR2RmdWalFmWUVXTTRvdGd4aXZuYVpr</guid></item><item><title>与显著延长寿命相关的日常小变化- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-small-daily-linked-longer.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

Tons of tests, products, and regimens promise to extend your lifespan, but living longer doesn’t have to be a time-consuming, bank-breaking enterprise. There are simple habits you can weave into your everyday routine to improve your longevity. The best part? They’re actually backed by science and experts, not just hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the &lt;a href="https://www.bluezones.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Blue Zones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—places around the world where people regularly live long lives with far less chronic disease than in the U.S. What Blue Zoners &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; do might be surprising: They don’t push through intense workouts, fill their cabinets with supplements, or follow fad diets. They get plenty of exercise, for example, but that’s because walking and other movement is naturally incorporated into their daily routines, not through long, punishing hours at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistency matters more than intensity when it comes to healthy aging,” says &lt;a href="https://lutanen.com/team/dr-jay-luthar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jay Luthar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jay Luthar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., a lifestyle and integrative medicine physician and the founder and medical director of Lutanen Health. “Small, sustainable habits practiced daily often outperform short-term, extreme interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are eight research-backed habits that can help you live longer—and better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eat more plants.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us could stand to get more plants in our diet: fruit, veggies, greens, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. “A predominantly plant-forward diet is one of the most consistently supported strategies for longevity across populations and cultures,” Dr. Luthar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plants are packed with nutrients to support longevity and prevent chronic illness, including fiber, polyphenols, and antioxidants. They reduce inflammation and cellular damage, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316623354841" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve insulin sensitivity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, and support gut, cardiovascular, and metabolic health, Dr. Luthar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re good for brain health, too. Research has found the powerful polyphenols in berries have &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/18785093241301881" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuroprotective benefits for the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;neuroprotective benefits for the brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while leafy greens are linked to &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/leafy-greens-linked-slower-age-related-cognitive-decline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slower cognitive decline;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;slower cognitive decline&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget the beans. “Legumes in the diet are one of the best predictors of longevity in the Blue Zone research,” says &lt;a href="https://princetonlongevitycenter.com/staff/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Fein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Fein&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., the founder and medical director of &lt;a href="https://princetonlongevitycenter.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Princeton Longevity Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Princeton Longevity Center&lt;/a&gt;.

Move more.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular physical activity is one of the most powerful interventions we have for extending both lifespan and healthspan,” says Dr. Luthar. Exercise improves &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6557987/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9256523/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7377236/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. It also lowers the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.70271" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38355154/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:depression;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim for at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/guidelines/adults.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:150 minutes of moderate cardio;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;150 minutes of moderate cardio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; per week, plus two days of strength training and some exercise that can improve mobility and flexibility, like yoga or Pilates. Also, incorporate more &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a69463400/zone-zero-exercise/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:non-exercise movement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;non-exercise movement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into your day—like walking and chores—to stay continuously active. That’s better than one intense hour at the gym followed by 12 hours of being sedentary, says Dr. Fein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Build strength.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle keeps us strong, upright, and functional. It also helps to maintain metabolic health. “Muscle is the main organ for controlling blood sugar,” says Dr. Fein. “When you lose muscle and when you are sedentary, you become more insulin-resistant. Not only does this accelerate aging, but it is also one of the determinants of your &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413124000603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of developing type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;risk of developing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcsm.70134" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lose a small percentage of our muscle mass;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lose a small percentage of our muscle mass&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; every year starting around age 35. Strength training can help to build muscle and slow down its loss—and you don’t need to become a bodybuilder for it to work. “Resistance training two times per week is sufficient for most people to see meaningful benefits,” says Dr. Luthar. Try &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/fitness/a40035772/how-to-start-lifting-weights-for-beginners/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:working out with free weights;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;working out with free weights&lt;/a&gt; and resistance bands, and doing bodyweight exercises, like squats and planks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Cut way back on alcohol.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, but research indicates there’s no harmless amount of alcohol. “Even just one drink per day may have negative effects on your health,” says Dr. Fein. When alcohol is metabolized, it produces &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/acetaldehyde" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:acetaldehyde;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acetaldehyde&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can damage DNA and interfere with its repair mechanism. This can put us more at risk for certain cancers and other diseases. Not only that, but alcohol can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079224001345" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disrupt sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disrupt sleep&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, speed up &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/one-alcoholic-drink-day-linked-reduced-brain-size" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brain aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and increase &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016882272300654X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:visceral fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;visceral fat&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking is deeply woven into our social fabric, so it can be hard to put a complete kibosh on it. One tactic to &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a61986397/what-happens-to-body-when-stop-drinking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drink more moderately;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drink more moderately&lt;/a&gt; could be to save alcohol for special occasions and long dinners with friends or family, Dr. Luthar suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Manage stress.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress does a number on our mental and physical health. “Chronic stress has profound effects on longevity through its impact on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159121000192" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168010221002078" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:immune function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;immune function&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41569-024-01024-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa70003318%2Flongevity-habits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular health;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs42255-025-01388-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa70003318%2Flongevity-habits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic regulation;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic regulation&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Luthar says. “Persistent activation of the stress response can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159122001477" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:accelerate biological aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;accelerate biological aging&lt;/a&gt; and increase the risk of chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While eliminating stress entirely isn’t feasible, finding healthy coping strategies can help keep it under control. &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/topics/mindfulness/meditation" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Meditation, breathwork;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meditation, breathwork&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1370399/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:yoga,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;yoga,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-023-35987-8&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa70003318%2Flongevity-habits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exercise;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01612840.2025.2512006#abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:creative hobbies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;creative hobbies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41380-023-02122-y&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Fwellness%2Fa70003318%2Flongevity-habits%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:time in nature;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;time in nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are all research-backed ways to squash stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Maintain social relationships.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your friends close can help you live longer. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953623007761" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Strong social and family relationships;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strong social and family relationships&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are one of the best predictors of longevity. &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/the-importance-of-connections-ways-to-live-a-longer-healthier-life/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Loneliness and social isolation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Loneliness and social isolation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can actually increase our risk of premature death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a strong social life appears to strongly correlate with a better chance of not only living longer but also maintaining good health and quality of life in the later decades,” Dr. Fein says. Social engagement can boost our mood and relieve stress, which has positive implications throughout the body. The stimulation that comes from conversation and interaction with others can also keep our brains sharp, Fein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Limit added sugar and ultra-processed foods.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diets high in added sugar and ultra-processed foods are associated with increased risks of obesity, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34904160/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39286398/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiovascular disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64656683/study-ultraprocessed-foods-premature-death/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:premature mortality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;premature mortality&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Luthar says. Plus, they are often nutrient-poor and can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266614972500043X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increase inflammation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a longevity perspective, minimizing ultra-processed foods and focusing on whole, minimally processed ingredients are more impactful than strict calorie-counting,“ Dr. Luthar says. Pay attention to ingredient lists, choose produce that’s in season and locally grown whenever possible, cook more at home, and focus on fiber-rich, plant-based foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Prioritize sleep.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults should aim for at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about/index.html#:~:text=The%20CDC's%20PLACES%20has%20local%20estimates%20on,conditions%20*%20Improve%20your%20attention%20and%20memory" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;seven hours&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of quality sleep a night. “Sleep is foundational to nearly every aspect of health and longevity,” Dr. Luthar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep accelerates biological aging, he adds. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19961/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chronic sleep deprivation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chronic sleep deprivation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression, obesity, and diabetes. That’s because the brain and body go into clean-up and repair mode while we sleep, and they can’t finish their work when we don’t get enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors and research agree that simple healthy habits can help us live longer. Consistency, not intensity, is the key. Several of these habits are diet-related, including eating more plant foods and less ultra-processed foods, and limiting or eliminating alcohol and added sugar. Regular sleep and exercise, including both cardio and weight training, can also increase our lifespan and healthspan. Maintaining strong social relationships and managing stress can add years to our lives and also make those years more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:15:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9UWFRud0NSYnBPYS05aXdRTHNYcjkyUDJISm5ZMUdMMElGQ291X0tWdEh0WDc0Z2hzZDZYbE1ZTkdoa3pxOGZaeHl3dXZBMVZBTkhza3NuNWFVUWN0TGxwMENnWXZ2dHowZ0tuLUxoSTkxMkFiQTN6Rg</guid></item><item><title>伯尔尼山地犬期待已久的拥抱来自新的金毛犬兄弟姐妹的一切-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/bernese-mountain-dogs-long-awaited-151000580.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My senior &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/little-dachshund-attempts-to-boss-cow-around" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dachshund;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dachshund&lt;/a&gt; wasn't thrilled when we adopted her much younger Pug mix brother. His high-energy personality and clinginess invaded the personal space she was used to, and she took some time to warm up to him.

Now the two are inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Binky the Bernese Mountain Dog seemed to have the same experience when she joined her new forever family. Rocco the &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-has-sweet-reaction-when-mom-stays-at-groomer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; was a little hesitant to show his new sister any sort of welcome, but apparently they've made an adorable breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the TikTok from @thegoldenboysfredandrocs, the gorgeous Golden was lying on the couch for some R&amp;amp;R time when Binky came over for some cuddles. Rocco wasn't interested and just turned his head, hoping to give Binky the hint. But the Bernese Mountain Dog didn't budge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Rocco has been very slow taking to his new sister," the online text explained. "But she keeps trying and trying to win his affection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rocco fidgeted around as Binky continued nuzzling her fur baby brother, refusing to give up on getting a snuggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At one point, Binky placed both front paws on the couch and wrapped Rocco up in a hug. It was almost like she said, "Ok big brother, enough is enough, let's break down these walls!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Golden Retriever looked at his sister and either felt moved to return the embrace or simply got tired of the cold shoulder routine. He placed his paw on the Bernese beauty to hug her back, much to the delight of their mom watching the whole scene unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This has given me hope," the caption read.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GLP-1s like Ozempic can support weight loss but may increase risk of nutrient deficiencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians recommend stocking up on nutrient-dense foods like beans, berries, yogurt, chicken and vegetables. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For personalized recommendations, work one-on-one with a registered dietitian.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More than 70% of adults in the United States are classified as having overweight or obesity. With the growing availability of GLP-1 medications for weight loss, many people are turning to these prescriptions as part of their health journey.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, recent data suggests that about 12% of U.S. adults have used a GLP-1 medication, such as Ozempic.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ozempic, also known as semaglutide, is a popular GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) agonist that helps regulate appetite and blood sugar.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It works by slowing digestion so you feel full longer, stimulating insulin release to lower blood glucose levels and acting on appetite centers in the brain to reduce hunger and food cravings,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these medications can be effective, what you eat still matters—especially when appetite is reduced. People taking GLP-1 medications need to be especially intentional with their food choices and prioritize nutrient-dense foods, says &lt;a href="https://www.laineyyounkin.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lainey Younkin, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that many individuals on weight-loss medications fall short on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833555/top-nutrients-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;key nutrients&lt;/a&gt;, including fiber, calcium, iron, magnesium, potassium, choline and vitamins A, C, D and E.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, they often fail to meet &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17573/what-is-a-serving-of-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;recommended servings for fruits&lt;/a&gt;, vegetables, grains and dairy, while exceeding suggested limits for total fat and saturated fat.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;These gaps raise clear concerns and highlight the importance of choosing foods that deliver maximum nutrition in smaller portions. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, many foods fit the bill. Here are 8 dietitian-recommended foods to add to your cart each week if you’re taking Ozempic on another GLP-1 medication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tiny but mighty, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-blackberries-good-for-you-11773841" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries pack a serious nutrient punch&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to their fiber and antioxidant content. “Berries are packed with anthocyanins, antioxidants that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress,” says Harris-Pincus.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Berries also result in a lower glycemic response than several other fruits, with a 1-cup serving of raspberries coming in at 8 grams of fiber.”&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That fiber works alongside Ozempic to help increase feelings of fullness while also supporting good bowel health. Younkin adds that higher intakes of anthocyanins have been associated with lower visceral fat stores and greater gut microbiome diversity—both of which &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-break-for-better-metabolic-health-8751700" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Whether you buy them fresh or frozen, they’re equally nutritious. For a quick, nutritious snack, try making a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-berry-bowl-8710522" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese-Berry Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Beans &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are a nutrient powerhouse, providing protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals. For example, a ½-cup serving of cooked black beans delivers about 7 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Together, these nutrients help support satiety and promote regular digestion while taking Ozempic, notes Harris-Pincus. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans also supply key nutrients that may be lacking in the diet of Ozempic users, including folate, potassium, iron and zinc. They also contain antioxidants, such as anthocyanins found in black and red kidney beans.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another bonus: beans are affordable and convenient to use. Simply open a can, rinse them well and add them to salads, soups or main meals, says Harris-Pincus.  For an easy, nourishing dinner, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sweet-potato-black-bean-quinoa-skillet-7165974" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sweet Potato, Black Bean &amp;amp; Quinoa Skillet&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-chicken"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Chicken &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a reason chicken tops the charts in many weight loss programs: it’s packed with protein and is naturally low in fat and carbohydrates, notes Younkin. A 3-ounce serving of chicken breast provides about 24 grams of protein for just 120 calories, making it an easy fit in an Ozempic-friendly meal plan.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The protein content keeps you full and satisfied and helps support muscle growth,” says Younkin. “I love buying a rotisserie chicken each week and using it throughout the week in salads, soups, quesadillas and wraps.” For a comforting casserole that still delivers on protein, try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7883913/chicken-cauliflower-rice-casserole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Cauliflower-Rice Casserole&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-fatty-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. Fatty Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Both Harris-Pincus and Younkin recommend eating fatty fish at least twice per week, including salmon, mackerel, sardines, herring and tuna. These fish are rich in omega-3 fatty acids—particularly EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)—which have been linked to improved heart and metabolic health.&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fatty fish also provide &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, helping you feel fuller for longer while preserving muscle mass, an important consideration when appetite is reduced on GLP-1 medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; New to fish or feeling intimidated? Start with canned salmon in these crowd-pleasing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270549/salmon-stuffed-avocados/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Salmon-Stuffed Avocados&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-strained-greek-style-yogurt"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Strained (Greek-style) Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another favorite of both Harris-Pincus and Younkin is strained (Greek-style) yogurt. One cup provides about 25 grams of high-quality protein and roughly 21% the Daily Value for calcium for just 165 calories, both of which are important nutrients to prioritize while taking a GLP-1 medication.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some varieties also contain probiotics, those good-for-you microorganisms that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support gut and immune health&lt;/a&gt; and may play a role in weight management.&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s an amazing vessel to build a protein and fiber-filled yogurt bowl with fruit, nuts, seeds and whole grain cereal,” says Harris-Pincus.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-oats"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 6. Oats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many whole grains can help you meet your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber needs&lt;/a&gt;, oats stand out for their beta-glucan content, a type of soluble fiber that supports gut health and helps lower cholesterol.&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “To put it in perspective, half a cup of oats has 4 grams of fiber, almost twice as much as one cup of broccoli that has 2 grams,” says Younkin.&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="15" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fiber is especially important when taking Ozempic, as it not only works with the medication to increase fullness and keep blood sugar balanced, but it can also help prevent constipation,” Younkin adds.&lt;span data-cite="16" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight oats are an easy, flexible option, and portions can be adjusted to suit smaller appetites. Try our fan-favorite &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/high-protein-strawberry-peanut-butter-overnight-oats-8611753" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High-Protein Strawberry &amp;amp; Peanut Butter Overnight Oats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-prunes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 7. Prunes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to digestive health, prunes are an often-overlooked standout. “Everyone knows prunes help to keep things “moving” and that’s even more relevant for folks taking GLP-1 medications,” shares Harris-Pincus. “These bite-sized nutritional gems also contain vitamin K, boron and polyphenol antioxidants, which &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support bone health&lt;/a&gt;, an often overlooked but critical consideration with weight loss, especially for perimenopausal and menopausal women.”&lt;span data-cite="17" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-cite="18" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A serving of 4 to 5 prunes delivers about 3 grams of fiber along with over 11 vitamins and minerals.&lt;span data-cite="18" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Given that nutrient shortfalls are common among people with GLP-1 medications, choosing a nutrient-dense food like prunes can help fill important gaps.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a balanced snack, pair prunes with a source of protein, such as cottage cheese, or a healthy fat, like slivered almonds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to vegetables, the more variety, the better. “It’s hard to pick just one vegetable you should buy every week because the most nutritious option is to mix it up every week to get a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of colorful fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; into your diet,” explains Younkin. “Each color delivers different antioxidants that help reduce inflammation and keep your gut microbiome thriving. This means you get more health benefits than if you rely on Ozempic alone.”&lt;span data-cite="19" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-when-taking-ozempic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Tips When Taking Ozempic &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with prioritizing good nutrition, consider these other tips to support your health while taking Ozempic:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work with a Registered Dietitian.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to work closely with a registered dietitian to help ensure you’re meeting your individual nutrient needs while taking a GLP-1. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Strength Training.&lt;/strong&gt; “Strength training is a non-negotiable when taking Ozempic”, says Younkin. While Ozempic can help with fat loss, it may also reduce muscle mass unless you actively work to preserve lean muscle. Aim for 2–3 strength training sessions per week.&lt;span data-cite="20" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Hydrated. &lt;/strong&gt;Grab that reusable water bottle before you head out the door! Adequate hydration helps prevent constipation, a common side effect when taking GLP-1s like Ozempic.&lt;span data-cite="21" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; GLP-1 medications like Ozempic can support weight loss, but they may also increase the risk of nutrient deficiencies. Because appetite is often reduced on these medications, dietitians recommend focusing on foods that deliver maximum nutrition in smaller servings. Berries, beans, chicken, strained (Greek-style) yogurt, fatty fish, vegetables, oats and prunes are all nutrient-packed options.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_75-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_76-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, working one-on-one with a registered dietitian is also important to make sure you’re meeting your personal nutrition needs.

ROACH: Why do people still die of pneumonia? With all the advances that we have seen in modern medicine, losing anyone to this ailment seems like such a waste. Is it a question of pneumonia being difficult to pin down because of the root cause, whether it’s bacterial, viral or fungal? Is it due to a delayed diagnosis and/or delayed treatment? Is it the development of drug-resistant pneumonia strains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G6DO64O7IZEETIVSNLVIEZJVLE"&gt;I just don’t get why people still die from pneumonia or “complications” from pneumonia. I’m a 73-year-old stroke and cancer survivor who is in relatively good health. How can I best avoid getting pneumonia myself? -- D.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZHQ4WOS4NJAXTHTVBQROYRJRC4"&gt;ANSWER: Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, sometimes called a “lower respiratory tract” infection to distinguish it from an “upper respiratory infection,” like bronchitis. The majority of pneumonias are bacterial or viral, but fungal pneumonia is a rare cause that is usually seen in hospitalized patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WPZZ456ZF5AVDH5MFI4ZJ6YTAY"&gt;You did a very good job of identifying some of the reasons that people still get very sick (and even die) of pneumonia, but an important additional reason is that there are some bacteria that grow very fast and are able to overwhelm the body’s immune system within days. It is often true that late medical attention allows the infection to progress to the point that we still lose patients from pneumonia, even with all that modern medicine can offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRQ77WNBMVE3LIDLNEN7ZZ4ZAM"&gt;Another reason is that when people are very frail, either because they are very old or have other underlying health conditions, the body’s defenses are weak. Antibiotics can only do so much; doctors still rely on the body to do most of the work by getting rid of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6GWHUGX3H5EXLEZLMIAH2IW3OM"&gt;Drug resistance is a big problem, especially inside the hospital. I have seen cases where the bacteria are resistant to all the available antibiotics. There has been a race between the ingenuity of drug developers and bacterial evolution, and our ingenuity has been slowing down lately, with fewer new types of antibiotics being discovered and released. Avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics helps reduce resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J5CSI4GIWVGPRCX4K5ONWELSGQ"&gt;The easiest thing a person over 50 can do to avoid pneumonia is get the available vaccines, especially the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV20 or PCV21, called Prevnar). But for a person with health issues in their 70s, you should get the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID-19 vaccines. Because influenza damages the lung’s ability to fight off infection, getting pneumonia after the flu is particularly dangerous, so the annual flu vaccine remains important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YMSPJTDJ7ZARJLROCD3FIDEGS4"&gt;Smoking also damages the lung’s ability to fight off infections, so quitting smoking reduces pneumonia risk. Excess alcohol consumption also predisposes people to pneumonia, so men shouldn’t exceed 2 drinks at a time (1 for women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XLABEISHJBDEJBPED6SKUDU5DY"&gt;Proper nutrition and good dental health are important for everyone. Diabetics should have their diabetes under good control. Chronic liver, lung, kidney and heart disease all predispose people to infections, so making sure that these are optimally managed reduces the risk further. Both cancer and its treatments can affect the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="Z2LZKSK7ONB3BP4634ITNP2ZDI"&gt;People who are at risk for pneumonia should know the signs and seek medical care quickly if pneumonia is suspected. Although the classic symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath can occur at any age, older people often have confusion and low fever. The heart rate is often raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="J2A754WT2NB6TMBTZXN4U2XRAM"&gt;Some symptoms can be subtle: new falls, incontinence, and loss of energy. A significant, unexplained change in overall functioning might signify a serious infection like pneumonia and deserves an evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

For one, it’s an excellent source of protein, delivering 20 grams in each 7-ounce serving.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “It’s also packed with calcium and vitamin D, which supports bone health, along with probiotics for a healthy gut microbiome,” says &lt;a href="https://www.alezozos.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ale Zozos, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7989862/steel-cut-rolled-or-instant-oats-which-is-the-healthiest/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whole grains, such as oats&lt;/a&gt;, are a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet and make a convenient, versatile addition to a satisfying breakfast. Zozos explains that they are an excellent source of soluble fiber, particularly beta-glucan, known for its &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-food-to-lower-cholesterol-11741278" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;LDL cholesterol–lowering properties&lt;/a&gt; and cardioprotective benefits.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Beta-glucans in oats have also been linked to improved blood sugar control, making them an excellent choice for type 2 diabetes management.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;To incorporate oats into your morning menu, Zozos recommends combining them with almonds and cinnamon for a delicious crumble topping like in this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cherry-crumble-8710606" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;No-Added-Sugar Cherry Crumble&lt;/a&gt; or enjoying them in a savory oatmeal bowl like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267654/savory-oatmeal-with-cheddar-collards-eggs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Savory Oatmeal with Cheddar, Collards, and Eggs&lt;/a&gt;.

Berries can be enjoyed stirred into oatmeal or yogurt, used as a topping or blended in smoothies like in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-lemon-blueberry-smoothie-8363288" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Anti-Inflammatory Lemon-Blueberry Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you like them scrambled, boiled or sunny-side up, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960178/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-eggs-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eggs are a nutrient-dense food&lt;/a&gt; that fits seamlessly into the Mediterranean diet. “Eggs are packed with choline, B vitamins, vitamin D and selenium, which are responsible for various aspects of brain health, including mood and cognition,” Zozos explains.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She adds that they are also a great source of protein and beneficial fats, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which support brain, joint and heart health. Recipes like our traditional Mediterranean &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/264596/shakshuka/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Shakshuka&lt;/a&gt; (eggs poached in spicy tomato sauce) or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7951834/frittata-with-asparagus-leek-ricotta/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Frittata with Asparagus, Leek &amp;amp; Ricotta&lt;/a&gt; are delicious ways to prepare eggs for a breakfast that follows the Mediterranean diet.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those craving a little crunch early in the morning, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nuts like almonds are the perfect addition&lt;/a&gt; to a Mediterranean-diet breakfast. Their natural crunch provides a satisfying contrast to creamy or soft foods, helping to elevate dishes like yogurt parfaits or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259665/berry-almond-smoothie-bowl/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Berry-Almond Smoothie Bowl&lt;/a&gt;. Almonds not only enhance the texture of meals but are also packed with essential nutrients like fiber, healthy fats, protein and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber and healthy fats, in particular, have been shown to help reduce LDL cholesterol, lowering the risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; is an easy way to increase the nutritional value of your breakfast. Russell shares that chia seeds are packed with fiber, polyphenols and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291962/8-best-vegan-omega-3-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; that protect heart health, support healthy blood pressure and balance blood sugar levels.&lt;span data-cite="13" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re looking for ways to add these tiny but mighty seeds to your A.M. meal, Russell suggests sprinkling them over peanut butter on sourdough bread, topped with sliced bananas, hemp seeds and a light drizzle of honey. You can also add chia seeds to your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-smoothie-8557968" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;morning smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, sprinkle them over &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-upgrade-for-overnight-oats-8773039" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or mix them into our thick and creamy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/strawberry-chia-pudding-8756143" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Strawberry Chia Pudding&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to traditional breakfast foods, butter is often the go-to source of fat. However, Russell points out that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; takes center stage in the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;. “It provides both flavor and dimension to any dish while also working to reduce the risk of heart disease,” she explains. The heart-protective benefits of olive oil stem from its abundance of monounsaturated fats and polyphenols.&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Russell recommends using olive oil in place of butter to cook eggs or even on your toast. “One delicious way to add olive oil to breakfast is to try out a tomato-and-basil bruschetta over sourdough with a runny egg topped with a drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil,” she suggests. Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/avocado-toast-with-jammy-eggs-8648174" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Avocado Toast with Jammy Eggs&lt;/a&gt;, which is finished with an olive oil touch.

Let's be honest–placing a chicken nugget on a table in front of a pair of Goldens and asking them to wait is basically setting them up for instant failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One mom recently shared a hilarious TikTok video putting her two &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-pulls-off-ultimate-113500022.html" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retrievers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Golden Retrievers&lt;/a&gt;’ willpower to the test, and the imaginary commentary is just as funny as the end result. TikToker @tuckerbudzyn placed one chicken nugget in front of Tucker, the older pup on the left, and Todd, the younger one on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She tells them to “leave it” and then leaves the room. As they watch her walk away, you can feel the tension rise, with both pups trying to decide what to do about the delicious, tempting piece of meat sitting just inches away and staring them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Poor Todd &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/golden-retriever-goes-battle-against-114500149.html" data-ylk="slk:didn’t stand a chance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;didn’t stand a chance&lt;/a&gt;—he was drooling before she even left the room. Tucker’s strategy, on the other hand, seemed to be working, as he kept his gaze fixed in the direction their mom disappeared. It was as if he knew that the moment he looked at the nugget, it would call to him even louder than it already was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/yorkies-field-trip-mcdonalds-most-120000965.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: Yorkies Take Field Trip to McDonalds in Most Adorable Fast-Food Run Ever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: Yorkies Take Field Trip to McDonalds in Most Adorable Fast-Food Run Ever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tucker even appeared to be sending telepathic messages to Todd, who hadn’t taken his eyes off the breaded hunks of chicken since Mom walked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, the temptation proved too great, and both Golden Retrievers finally caved. They scarfed those chicken nuggies down in a single gulp. Of course, when Mom returns and asks, “Does someone want to tell me what happened?” both boys clam up immediately. Tucker lays his head on the table, while Todd decides he’ll be much safer hiding underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Funny Reactions From the Comment Section&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This video went viral quickly, with more than 50K likes on TikTok. Many fans expressed their support for the boys, including one person who said, "In their defense, you technically didn’t specify how long they needed to leave it. You only told them that you’d be right back. So in conclusion, they’re innocent of any wrongdoing!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another commenter wrote, "In Tucker's defense, he HAD to eat his, otherwise Todd would have!" and he's probably not wrong!

called the WNT pathway - to grow tumours in the intestine and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This breakthrough information could introduce ways to interrupt the process preventing disease growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The protein called nucleophosmin (NPM1), which is involved in the control of growth, was found to be in high levels in bowel cancer and some liver cancers, due to the genetic errors in the WNT pathway, according to a new paper from Nature Genetic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By blocking this protein, the research team found that it may be possible to develop new treatments for specific cancers which hijack the body's growth system through this genetic error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Bowel cancer remains the second most common cause of cancer death across the country, claiming around 1,700 lives annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;While around 670 people die from liver cancer each year in Scotland so finding more effective ways to tackle the disease is vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Lead researcher on the project Prof Owen Sansom said: "Because NPM1 isn't essential for normal adult tissue health, blocking it could be a safe way to treat certain cancers, like some hard-to-treat bowel and liver cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We found that if NPM1 is removed, cancer cells struggle to make proteins properly and this allows a tumour suppressor to activate, preventing cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Increasing numbers of people are affected by these cancers, with some treatments limited for some patients, so finding a new way to tackle these cancers is crucial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:54:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5aZEc5Szh2U2VvRl94by1ROVNCOU4tNXI4d0g0ZkJyTmxtbVdDVGVnUTlORnBXY3h1eURpa3dxWlh3cG4yT1RPMVp4YVVvVTlqVW45TUgyd3lkd9IBX0FVX3lxTFB6cUdEc3lTS29NMjJXQlVpSjJ2cVRQYm5JODQ4UGNtbWtmWFUyby1WRnFBSUZGa0d3b1pQcWF1Q2NnQzB1UDdMelhreUhqQmNqMWNXQlN2dmJZZ3gxNEh3</guid></item><item><title>喝完，咖啡爱好者-一项研究表明，咖啡可以延长您的寿命- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/drinking-coffee-may-add-2-years-to-your-life-11887769</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research has indicated that drinking coffee may increase health span by two years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee contains antioxidants that may help protect against chronic conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stick with 2-3 cups/day of coffee and limit added sugar or artificial sweeteners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee sure has made the rounds regarding its health status. Many years ago, it was thought to be a noxious habit.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More recently, however, evidence is mounting toward its beneficial effects on health. If you’re a coffee drinker, you know one benefit is that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/why-does-coffee-make-you-poop-8558449" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;it gets things moving in the morning&lt;/a&gt; (buh-bye constipation!). But that’s just the tip of the coffee bean. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking coffee &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;has also been linked to&lt;/a&gt; a reduced risk of heart disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and it may help your thyroid work better. You’ve probably also noticed that a cup of joe can make you feel happier and more energetic. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what about longevity? Could that coffee habit help you live longer? Researchers in Portugal wanted to know, too, so they did a large review of existing studies to see what research to date has shown; here's what they found.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-do-we-know-about-coffee-and-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Do We Know About Coffee and Health? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These researchers combed through studies and meta-analyses that had previously been published and compiled them into this one review. This was a very involved and thorough review—the researchers analyzed data from more than 50 studies done in the Americas, Europe and Asia. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First, they discussed the aging process and how various bodily systems tend to deteriorate as we age, including how this affects the way we interact within our environment. For example, eyesight and hearing tend to be reduced as we age, which can influence how quickly we age if they’re not tended to. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They went on to discuss how coffee contains over 2,000 potentially bioactive substances, many of which act like antioxidants. Of course, coffee also contains caffeine. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers then went on to investigate what studies suggest coffee’s influence is on life span, as well as diseases, conditions and health habits that affect life span—like heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory diseases. They also looked at coffee’s impact on cognition, depression and sleep. Then to go even further, they examined evidence of coffee’s impact on the body at the cellular level. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-review-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did This Review Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately there was one overarching finding. Regular coffee consumption seems to increase not just life span, but also health span (quality of life), by decreasing the incidence of the primary age-associated diseases that contribute to early death. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; They concluded that regularly drinking coffee was associated with preserving muscular, cardiovascular, mental and immune system functions. And it reduces the risk of diseases that commonly affect the elderly, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, stroke, some cancers, diabetes, dementia, major depression and frailty. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regularly drinking coffee may even help you better adapt to stressful situations. And when you can gracefully handle stress—and nix some of your stressors—you reduce your disease risk and may live longer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bringing all the evidence together, regular coffee drinkers may enjoy an extra two years of life. And it’s not just more years, but years with good health. Because really, what good is a longer life if you don’t also have a good quality of life?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like most things, more is not necessarily better, and this is true with coffee. The researchers found that the sweet spot tends to be between 2 and 3 cups per day. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009784/how-much-caffeine-is-too-much/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;If you overdo it&lt;/a&gt;, you may experience anxiety, sleeplessness, jitteriness and racing heart rate—to name a few. And the health benefits don’t increase with more, and they may even diminish. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few caveats to note. First, most research on coffee has been done on younger people, under age 65. So the researchers could not necessarily transfer some of the findings to older adults. For example, they couldn’t say with any level of certainty that regularly drinking coffee will reduce heart disease risk in healthy 80-year-olds since many of the studies were done on young and middle-aged adults. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of the studies were observational, so coffee intake was recorded by participants (like as part of a food diary). This means that researchers depended on participants being honest about their coffee intake—including the amount of coffee they drank and whether the coffee was black or contained cream, sugar, flavor shots, artificial sweeteners, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These researchers note that tea and chocolate have similar bioactive components to coffee, so if you’re not a coffee drinker, don’t feel like you need to start a java habit just for the benefits. We’ve previously reported on other health habits that have also shown an association with living longer—like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-increase-odds-of-living-longer-by-28-per-new-study-8661763" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;replacing sitting time with light physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists aren’t yet sure what components in coffee are responsible for all these health benefits—the bioactive compounds or the caffeine. It might be a little bit of both, but more research is needed to figure that out. They’re also still trying to figure out through what mechanisms coffee benefits the body. One pathway they’re leaning toward is that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962690/does-coffee-cause-inflammation-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;black coffee may reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. And when we have lower inflammation, we have a lower risk of disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Until scientists figure it all out, know that your coffee habit might help you enjoy a longer life. Just skip the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7912339/the-best-and-worst-things-to-add-to-your-coffee-according-to-dietitians/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flavor boosters&lt;/a&gt;—at least most of the time—since we know that too much &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7869775/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-cut-out-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;added sugar&lt;/a&gt;, saturated fat and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; can wreak havoc on health over time. Also, focus on other health habits known to reduce disease risk and potentially add years to your life. This includes eating a varied, balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, managing your stressors, getting plenty of quality sleep and spending time with loved ones.

While freezing may cause slower formation of resistant starch, it’s typically recommended to preserve its quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Storage affects the texture, too. “For refrigeration, the texture ends up being drier as the cooler temperature and circulation of the fridge dehydrates the product unless tightly sealed when cooled,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chau-time.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Brian Chau" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.chau-time.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brian Chau&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, principal food scientist at Chau Time. An easy fix is to add a bit of water when reheating, whether you’re toasting it or warming it in the oven or on the stovetop. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freezing, on the other hand, makes bread more rigid. “When thawing frozen foods, the cell structures rupture from the ice formation,” Chau said. “This can further rearrange the starch alignment to create a different and possibly more resistant structure of starches&lt;span&gt; in the food.” While freezing may alter the structure in this way, the total amount of resistant starch formed is generally higher in bread stored in the fridge. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Health Benefits Of Resistant Starch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These temperature changes affect digestion — fresh bread produces a higher glycemic response than refrigerated or frozen. In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17426743/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="one study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17426743/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that toasting bread after freezing and defrosting lowered glucose response even further, likely because the freeze–toast–cool cycle creates multiple heat-and-cool phases that favor resistant starch formation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Because resistant starch isn’t absorbed into the bloodstream, it has little effect on blood sugar, making it helpful for people with insulin resistance, including Type 2 diabetes. “Resistant starch slows the absorption of other carbohydrates into the blood,” Zenker explained. “Because less of the carbohydrates in the food are absorbed, the impact on blood sugar is more blunted, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;reducing blood glucose and insulin spikes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This supports steady energy throughout the day, helps prevent sugar crashes and promotes feelings of fullness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond impacting blood sugar, resistant starch supports gut health, as it reaches the colon intact, where it feeds gut bacteria. “[Gut bacteria] consume resistant starch and release beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate,” Zenker said. Butyrate fuels healthy colon cells, reduces inflammation, and even influences brain health via the gut–brain axis. SCFAs also help maintain the intestinal lining, lowering the risk of what’s commonly referred to as “leaky gut.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s also emerging evidence that resistant starch may aid feelings of fullness. “Indirectly, resistant starch may impact satiety and blood sugar by increasing GLP-1 production in the gut,” Zenker explained. SCFAs stimulate colon cells to produce GLP-1, a hormone that signals fullness to the brain. This is the same pathway targeted by popular GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic. While boosting GLP-1 naturally may help reduce hunger and cravings, Zenker notes that more research is needed to fully understand the impact of resistant starch on GLP-1 and satiety.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Javier Zayas Photography via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Javier Zayas Photography via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Toasting your bread after freezing it can significantly lower glycemic responses.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Starch Trick Works On More Than Just Bread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond bread, starchy foods like rice, pasta and potatoes also gain resistant starch when cooked and cooled. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41387-022-00196-1" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="One study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=38395X987171&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;xcust=694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41387-022-00196-1" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that cooled and reheated rice led to a 30% lower rise in blood glucose compared with freshly cooked rice. “It’s important to note that the benefit of resistant starch is small, so moderate portions still matter,” Zenker said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like bread, storage plays a role in balancing resistant starch formation and texture. “I typically recommend storing foods like potatoes in the fridge for up to three days because freezing can make them unpleasant,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gutfriendlynutrition.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Sarah Glinski" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://gutfriendlynutrition.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah Glinski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Canadian registered dietitian specializing in gut health. For rice and pasta, she advises choosing storage based on when you’ll eat them: refrigeration works for up to three days, while freezing is best for longer-term storage — up to three months — before texture starts to suffer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Meaningful Is The Difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17426743/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="small 2008 study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="694962f4e4b099a75cbd9114" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17426743/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;small 2008 study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; looked at how freezing and toasting white bread affects blood sugar.

Eating foods high in fiber, like resistant starch, can be a way to enjoy carbohydrates without them impacting your blood sugars as much.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Pick Bread That Supports Your Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Beyond storage, the key to healthy bread is what’s inside the loaf and how much you eat. “I typically recommend people choose whole wheat bread or sprouted grain bread, which is naturally higher in fiber,” Glinski said. Breads with seeds like chia, flax and sunflower are also good sources, aiming for at least 3 grams per slice. “For healthy blood sugar levels, choose bread with less than 3 grams of sugar per slice, and check the ingredient list for cane sugar, honey, molasses or brown rice syrup,” Glinski added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those who need to limit fermentable carbs (FODMAPs), sourdough can be a good option, as it generally has lower FODMAP content and may be gentler on digestion. Ultimately, portion size and what’s in your bread still play a big role in making each slice healthier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPQlhZdTRNOVNRTXBJZ3huVkpFa21jT2RmRWpmbC1rN0FpUUthaVZyT1dXNGxpOVlzdGVKTkYyY1BLVk5uS3ZLV0N3LTEtRUJCOWtQWkY3NU9ZX2xQRDlBb0FIRnlheWRZcTA5a0xEeXhqVlBscmpyaENKTVpfWW9JSmhYVjhDNXBmMVFrSTNfeGRnRWFaTzJhRkRGRdIBoAFBVV95cUxNeFVvcEE4LWhQTjFSWEJla0ZMel9MUGxXNUdCS3VXaGd1NlZSQXpMaGRlZTNNcXc2MDdoWTNrRnFIVEExRGFiME5SaXJ2TUJYNlFCbThUNGc2MTZfRURiVkpUajhjYkluNEhQSWg3V0NOekFiRk5hN0oyU3c1ZEJleWZBSHNDTjgxQzFCSzliOVFWM0xDMHQ1bDRkNC1OVHhl</guid></item><item><title>1个被低估的技能父母需要开始教他们的儿子- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/boys-anger-goog_l_696a79c0e4b084474f1283d6</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I found out I was having my first boy five years ago, I was elated and excited ... and then worried about anger. There had recently been yet another school shooting, followed by yet another rash of headlines about boys, guns and rage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand the roots of that kind of violence are deeply complex, and that in my own life I am surrounded by loving, empathetic men. But I was also a hormonal soon-to-be first-time mom (who, in hindsight, was probably grappling with a touch of perinatal anxiety). I worried that I would raise an angry young man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not alone. Concerns about boys and anger abound, as comedian and writer Michael Ian Black captured in his viral 2018 New York Times opinion piece “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/opinion/boys-violence-shootings-guns.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="The Boys Are Not All Right" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696a79c0e4b084474f1283d6" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/opinion/boys-violence-shootings-guns.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;The Boys Are Not All Right&lt;/a&gt;.” “The man who feels lost but wishes to preserve his fully masculine self has only two choices: withdrawal or rage,” he wrote. The story has more than 2,100 comments. Clearly it struck a chord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that I know my boys and have spent years watching their beautiful, complex little personalities unfold, those fears I held during my pregnancy seem distant and reductive. &lt;em&gt;Of course&lt;/em&gt; they do not inherently struggle with anger simply because they are boys. And yet they do lash out — sometimes in frustration, sometimes when I ask them to do something they don’t want to. What I want is to help them navigate that anger, so they can experience the feeling, but not be overwhelmed by it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents need to give their children the tools to understand their feelings, and it needs to be developed just like developing understanding of other complicated and abstract concepts,” said Steven Meyers, a professor of psychology at Roosevelt University in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, first and foremost, it helps to understand the basics of what anger is: basically, a response to a perceived threat. The body releases adrenaline (the hormone that plays a key role in the fight-or-flight response) and the heart rate and blood pressure go up. It is absolutely fine — and sometimes really positive — to feel angry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s when that anger is not managed in a healthy way that it can become problematic. So here are some tips for parents to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, understand that there &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be differences in how boys and girls experience and express anger.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there is so much nuance when it comes to individuals, emotions — and how they express those emotions. It is not fair, nor accurate, to say that all boys experience anger one way, while all girls experience it another. And research shows it is a myth that boys and men experience anger more than girls and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet experts say there can be big broad-strokes distinctions parents might want to at least have in mind as they help guide their children through all of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychologists have a saying that boys externalize and girls internalize. This means that boys are more likely to take their anger and distress and direct it outward, where it can become verbal or physical aggression. On the other hand, girls are more likely to direct their anger and frustrations inward towards themselves, so it can become self-blame or even depression,” Meyers said. “Naturally, this is a simplification, but there are gender differences in the rates of these different disorders between girls and boys, as well as between women and men.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Help your child learn how to label his feelings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first step to stress and anger management is to help your child identify what’s going on, and to empathize with it,” said Kelsey Torgerson Dunn, a social worker who runs a private counseling practice in St. Louis that focuses on anxiety counseling and anger management for children and teens. Young kids don’t always recognize what they’re experiencing. Heck, adults struggle to identify their root feelings a lot of the time. But if you don’t understand what the problem is — in this case, feelings of anger or frustration that might lead a child to act out — you can’t solve the problem. Labeling the feeling is so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a younger kid, that might mean explicitly describing their emotions — like, “your body looks like it’s feeling frustrated,” Dunn offered by way of example, or “it seems like you are feeling angry, because I told you ‘no.’” Don’t worry about being presumptuous or getting it wrong. Your kid might turn around and tell you that they’re not actually feeling angry, they’re feeling XYZ thing — and that’s totally fine. You’ve prompted them to identify what is going on internally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older kids and teens probably won’t respond all that well to those kinds of prompts, but they might still need some help identifying their feelings in the moment. So for them, labeling might sound something more like, “If I were in this situation, I’d probably feel pretty mad. Walk me through what’s going on for you,” Dunn recommended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“One sentence that I often use when working with boys is that ‘you can feel whatever you want to feel, but you can’t always do whatever you want to do.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Steven Meyers, psychologist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be soothing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although parents might react to a child’s anger or outburst by walking away (and strategic ignoring &lt;a href="https://childmind.org/article/managing-problem-behavior-at-home/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="can certainly be one way" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="696a79c0e4b084474f1283d6" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://childmind.org/article/managing-problem-behavior-at-home/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;can certainly be one way&lt;/a&gt; to help diffuse tantrums), experts say there is a strong argument to be made for soothing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anger can overwhelm young children. They do not necessarily have the ability to calm themselves down so that they become more reasonable,” Meyers said. “There are many ways to soothe and comfort an angry young child, but it may require a shift in the parent’s mindset or focus in the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be patient and calm. Make it clear that you’re not looking to just stifle or deny their anger in the moment — which is especially important with boys, who have historically been taught to bottle up their emotions. The goal is ultimately to help your kids get to a point where they’re able to self-soothe, perhaps by taking deep breaths, walking away or taking a few moments to themselves to calm down. By acting calm and soothing in the moment yourself, you’re modeling compassion for oneself and for others, which is a very good thing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide consequences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse being soothing with being permissive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consequences are needed when anger spills over into aggression, especially as boys get older,” Meyers said. “One sentence that I often use when working with boys is that ‘you can feel whatever you want to feel, but you can’t always do whatever you want to do.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consequences can take many different forms, depending on how old your child is, what the specific circumstances are, and what his personality responds to — and, of course, those things can change by the day. But things like brief time-outs or loss of privileges can be powerful tools in teaching boys that there is a difference between emotions and behaviors. Spend a bit of time thinking about the types of consequences you’re comfortable with, so that you’re not blurting out random threats after your child has expressed their anger in a way you’re not comfortable with. Certain strategies work better for some children than others, so you might need to recalibrate and try out a few things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, what you’re trying to teach is that it is absolutely OK to feel angry and to express that you are feeling angry. It is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; OK to act out on that anger in an aggressive way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2 class="h3-style"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re worried about your child’s anger, ask for help.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Psychologists use the standards of frequency, duration, intensity, and age-appropriateness when they assess whether a behavior is a symptom of a disorder,” said Meyers, so those are criteria parents who are concerned about their son’s anger or aggression should pay attention to. There aren’t hard and fast rules about what’s typical and what’s not, but if your son seems to be struggling with anger on a daily basis, that might be a sign something more serious is going on, Meyers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunn said it’s also helpful to consider whether certain behaviors — like aggression — are happening across settings, such as if your child is having similar problems at home &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; at school. That kind of consistency signals that it is less about the particular situation in which they find themselves, and more about their general response to feelings of anger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned, experts say talking to your child’s pediatrician is a good place to start, and checking in with his teachers can also be helpful. It might take some digging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents don’t always know what is going on underneath their sons’ anger. There might be stress, or anxiety, or depression,” Dunn said. “It’s important to find out what it might be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:00:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE5JbHRaaGlQRm9ocWR1Mkp6M2U0c1FueEFlVUJmRGpuUTRHYmJldElTX05OUjl6LWhWVTJOd1RGUmRDNjhON05BUXkzVm5SMzBtYUNJNGxOaVYwN18tY3pwSlVVdmEzRE1HSmNjQjNvYjZ5NVNUZU5McVpUNzZlQdIBgwFBVV95cUxQaHVYRjJuQjNiVENPWWlFcWtNSmRZdlM2RDdsVXFYU3RnUmYyLUVON0dNMEc4cjVWVFBEQ0ZMY3FlMHU4b2Y4cVZHSUhHcEdwYUpSQ2J1Q2NILUJOZXVMWTJZd3NyZTgtMFhLbEpOTHl1X1lMRFZNUGZUVXRSMDFCMEREQQ</guid></item><item><title>使用天然脂肪刺拳替代品，我在10周内减掉了5公斤-《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/wight-loss-without-ozempic-glp1-production/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;None of this was news to me really, yet my diet still didn’t have the right balance of those things. The results, as Roberta and Carline made clear, would never be as dramatic or effective as powerful prescription GLP-1 injections, but for someone like me, looking to lose around a stone, it felt far safer and more sensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Balancing blood sugars and implementing change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before suggesting any changes, Caroline took a full medical history and asked me to wear a continuous glucose monitor for two weeks. The small device synced to an app on my phone and tracked how my blood sugar responded to different foods, meals and daily habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were unexpectedly eye-opening. On several nights, my glucose dipped to 3.1 mmol/L while I slept – low enough to be classified as hypoglycaemia. Roberta and Caroline wrote to my GP requesting comprehensive blood tests. The results ruled out underlying issues, but it was obvious that my blood sugar regulation needed attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution, again, was surprisingly simple: start eating in a way that kept blood sugar stable throughout the day to prevent overnight crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair devised a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/the-303030-diet-that-helps-you-lose-4lb-a-week/"&gt;plan built around high protein&lt;/a&gt;, fibre and healthy fats. The primary goal was to ensure the first meal of the day delivered around 30g of protein, with total daily protein intake calculated at approximately 1.6g per kilogram of body weight. Refined carbohydrates such as white rice, pasta and potatoes were reduced in favour of a much higher intake of fibrous vegetables. Healthy fats were actively encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also advised to finish eating by around 7.30pm, fasting overnight until breakfast to support metabolic balance. Eggs, lean meats, oily fish, berries, legumes, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/kombucha-kimchi-kefir/"&gt;fermented foods such as kimchi&lt;/a&gt; and kefir, olive oil, nuts, seeds, green tea and even a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar in diluted water were priorities. Nothing exotic. Nothing extreme. There were also a small number of supplements to support blood sugar balance and gut health [see below].&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Your fitness tracker might be telling you that you need 10,000 steps, 30 minutes of cardio or even an hour at the gym every day. But what if you could improve your health in just a few minutes a day? A growing body of research suggests you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1249/JES.0000000000000275"&gt;"Exercise snacks"&lt;/a&gt; are brief bursts of vigorous exercise, typically lasting one minute or less, scattered throughout your day. Think climbing a few flights of stairs, doing some squats during a work break, or a quick burst of jumping jacks before lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional workouts, these "snacks" aren't done back-to-back – they're spread across your waking hours, separated by one to four hours of your regular activities such as working, commuting, or watching TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-the-optimal-number-of-daily-steps-for-longevity-and-its-not-10000"&gt;Scientists Identify The Optimal Number of Daily Steps For Longevity, And It's Not 10,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept differs from high-intensity interval training (Hiit), where you might do multiple intense bursts of activity within a single 20-minute workout. Exercise snacks are more like grazing throughout the day rather than sitting down for a full meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2025-110027"&gt;recent meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found that in previously sedentary adults, exercise snacks significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness, a measure of how well your heart and lungs work during physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review concluded that these bite-sized workouts delivered meaningful health benefits, with an impressive 83% of participants sticking to their routines for up to three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why exercise snacking works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;Around a third of adults&lt;/a&gt; worldwide don't get enough physical activity. When asked why, the answers are almost always the same: no time and no motivation. Exercise snacks tackle both barriers head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2018-0675"&gt;In a 2019 study&lt;/a&gt;, sedentary young adults were asked to vigorously climb a three-flight stairwell three times per day – with one to four hours of recovery between bouts. Each session also included a brief warm-up of jumping jacks, squats, and lunges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six weeks, the stair climbers showed significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness compared to a control group – a key marker linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2009.681"&gt;longevity and reduced cardiovascular disease risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's particularly striking about exercise snacks is their efficiency. While &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24/1451"&gt;current guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week, exercise snacks can deliver measurable benefits in far less time – sometimes just a few minutes daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microdosing-exercise-in-tiny-bursts-works-but-theres-1-golden-rule"&gt;Microdosing Exercise in Tiny Bursts Works – But There's 1 Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2023-0593"&gt;2024 randomised controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; compared stair-climbing exercise snacks to 40 minutes of moderate-intensity cycling three times weekly. Remarkably, the exercise snacks group – doing three 30-second, all-out stair climbs per session – improved their fitness by 7%, while the cycling group showed no significant change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits extend beyond fitness. A large-scale &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-02100-x"&gt;study of over 25,000 adults&lt;/a&gt; who didn't exercise found that those who accumulated just three to four minutes of vigorous activity daily through activities such as fast walking or climbing stairs had a 40% lower risk of dying from any cause. They also had a nearly 50% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease compared to those who did none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's evidence that exercise snacks have blood sugar benefits, too. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00125-014-3244-6"&gt;Research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that brief, intense exercise snacks performed before meals can reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes in people with insulin resistance (a precursor to type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="189355" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;) – potentially good news for anyone concerned about their metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best exercise snacks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty of exercise snacks is their flexibility. You don't need special equipment, a gym membership, or to even change your clothes. Here are some practical ways to incorporate them into your day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stair climbing is perhaps the most researched exercise snack. If you work in an office building or live in a block of flats, you've got free exercise equipment at your disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189396" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189396" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/woman_running_up_stairs_642.jpg" alt="woman running up stairs" class="wp-image-189396 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/woman_running_up_stairs_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/woman_running_up_stairs_642-600x374.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189396" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Working in an office building means you've got free exercise equipment at your disposal. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEJeF2DkxA/"&gt;Nikada/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try climbing vigorously – fast enough that you're breathing hard by the top – for 20-60 seconds, two to three times throughout your day. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2002.001131"&gt;Earlier research&lt;/a&gt; found that women who progressively increased their stair climbing to five ascents daily saw a 17% improvement in fitness after just eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking bursts count too, provided they're vigorous. Try doing a brisk one-minute walk around the office or a quick lap of your garden a few times a day. But in order to see benefits, you've got to make sure the pace is quick enough that holding a conversation becomes difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-few-minutes-of-exercise-today-could-do-wonders-for-your-brain-tomorrow"&gt;A Few Minutes of Exercise Today Could Do Wonders For Your Brain Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodyweight exercises such as squats, lunges or wall push-ups can be done almost anywhere. Try a set of ten squats every time you make a cup of tea or some wall push-ups before lunch. The key is intensity – you should feel your heart rate rise and be slightly out of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency matters more than perfection when it comes to exercise snacks. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2018-0675"&gt;The research shows&lt;/a&gt; that even very brief sessions – as short as 20 seconds – can contribute to fitness improvements so long as they're repeated regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick is building these snacks into existing habits. Climb stairs before your morning  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="189355" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt;. Do squats during TV adverts. Take a brisk walk after finishing a work call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacks won't replace the full range of benefits you'd get from a comprehensive fitness programme. But for the millions of us who struggle to find time for traditional workouts, they offer a practical entry point – one backed by increasingly robust science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest gains in health happen when someone goes from doing nothing to doing something. So next time you're waiting for the kettle to boil or have a few minutes between meetings, consider having an exercise snack. Your heart will thank you.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272836/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                          &lt;/figure&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p&gt;Thailand has recorded "almost 1,000 cases" of monkeypox since the viral disease emerged in 2022, with Bangkok reporting the highest number of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of patients had a history of sexual activity with unfamiliar partners, deputy government spokeswoman Airin Phanrit said on Monday, citing data from the Department of Disease Control (DDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said people were advised to avoid close contact with individuals who have unusual skin rashes or blisters, especially in crowded tourist spots, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most cases were Thai nationals of working-age, about 97% of them men. The disease was often found in major tourist destinations visited by Thais and foreigners, Ms Airin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand recorded its &lt;a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2351002" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first case&lt;/a&gt; of monkeypox in Phuket in 2022. By September 2025 the total number of reported mpox cases had risen to 933, with 13 deaths, DDC figures showed. She gave no current total, only "almost 1,000 cases".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The five provinces with the highest number of confirmed monkeypox cases are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bangkok: 458 cases (454 males and four females)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chon Buri: 85 cases (84 males and one female)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nonthaburi: 50 cases (49males and one female)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phuket: 35 cases (28 males and seven females)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samut Prakan: 32 cases (30 males and two females)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DDC had been instructed to strictly surveil and screen people for infection in areas where cases were reported, Ms Airin said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month, the department had distributed at least 2,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine to medical personnel in the public and private sectors, and among groups with high-risk sexual behaviour in Bangkok, Chonburi, Chiang Mai and Phuket, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation happens to the best of us. And while we might not want to discuss our harrowing bathroom journeys, they don’t seem to have the same subtlety. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/constipation-diet-study-11769333" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;When you suffer from constipation&lt;/a&gt;, it can feel like a true feat to get out of the frustrating cycle. Luckily, researchers are continuing to study ways we can mitigate infrequent or hard-to-pass stools. Recently, a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jhn.70133" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nocaes"&gt;fascinating study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by England’s &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/kiwis-could-help-manage-chronic-constipation" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nocaes"&gt;King’s College&lt;/a&gt; was published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Human Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Neurogastroenterology &amp;amp; Motility&lt;/em&gt;, noting findings that three specific foods showed a positive influence on constipation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kiwi, rye bread and (the already beloved) prunes really could improve your constipation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kiwi is unique&lt;/a&gt; in that it contains soluble and insoluble fiber and an enzyme called actinidin, which has been shown to increase your gut’s ability to break down certain proteins. The kiwi is also a good source of water. Rye bread is another standout from the study, as the grain contains more soluble fiber than traditional wheat flour breads. Prunes are another food &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/prunes-benefits-8694943" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;known for a high fiber &lt;/a&gt;count per serving, but they also contain a sugar alcohol called sorbitol, which helps draw water into the stool and make it easier to pass. To optimize benefits, you’ll want to eat one of these ingredients daily in the recommended amounts from the study. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To ensure you have these helpful ingredients on hand next time you experience constipation symptoms, you need to store them properly. We found the best options below to shop online, so all you need to do is go to the grocery store for your three ingredients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-unripe-kiwi"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Unripe Kiwi &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-caxxa-countertop-fruit-bowl"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Caxxa Countertop Fruit Bowl &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kiwi can take weeks to ripen, so the best place to pop the fruit is in a bowl in your pantry or on your countertop away from heat and sunlight, then wait until they get soft enough to eat. We recommend an airy wire basket just like this Caxxa one. As fruit ripens, the last thing you need is a soggy mess at the bottom of your bowl. This helps maintain breathability and is great for other produce, too. Just make sure you don’t keep kiwifruits with any produce that emits ethylene gas (apples, pears and bananas), as that will cause excessive ripening.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-prunes-and-cut-kiwi"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Prunes and Cut Kiwi  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are two avenues you can go down when it comes to storing prunes in your pantry and cut kiwi in the refrigerator. An &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-glass-food-storage-containers-8387775" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;airtight glass container&lt;/a&gt; is one of them. This is a sturdy option that allows for easy stacking in any kitchen space, so you can maximize your storage. I love these Pyrex containers (they’re a tested favorite of ours), and the larger 11-cup size here means you can give your dried or fresh fruits plenty of space. Prunes can become rocks if you don’t control the moisture, which is why we recommend placing them in an airtight container. And oxygen and moisture loss can cause your precious kiwifruit to dry out or become a mushy mess, so this airtight option checks every box.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-stasher-premium-silicone-reusable-food-storage-bag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Stasher Premium Silicone Reusable Food Storage Bag &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This second option is great if you prefer the flexibility of a bag (literally). Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-reusable-food-storage-bags-8745585" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;favorite reusable silicone option&lt;/a&gt; from Stasher is a great choice. This particular bowl-like shape yields extra space to avoid overcrowding of your prunes or kiwis. We really appreciate how well Stasher bags seal, and the silicone material is incredibly durable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bread is finicky, but luckily, there are some great products to help mitigate moldy spots or rock-hard interiors. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bees-wrap-beeswax-wrap-plastic-wrap-replacement-amazon-11849077" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;My favorite beeswax wrap&lt;/a&gt; brand came out with these genius bread wraps that maintain a breathable environment while keeping the moisture you need locked in. It’s made with cotton, jojoba oil, beeswax and tree resin, and its waxy interior has a soft, malleable feel. This helps seal the wrap with the heat of your hands, and since you can tighten it as much or as little as you want to, it’s excellent for a slice or loaf of bread. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-augshy-linen-bread-bag-set"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Augshy Linen Bread Bag Set &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme figure-landscape figure-high-res"&gt; 
&lt;figcaption id="mntl-figure-caption_5-0" class="comp mntl-figure-caption text-utility-100 figure-article-caption"&gt; &lt;span class="figure-article-caption-owner"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plastic bags ruin the crusty exterior of good-quality rye breads and can cause molding since they aren’t breathable. These linen bread bags are an excellent alternative; keeping your loaf tucked in one ensures you protect that hard-earned texture while keeping your loaf soft enough to enjoy. Once the loaf is cut, store the bag with bread cut side down on your countertop to keep the interior fluffy.

Taking to Instagram on January 19, Dr Saurabh Sethi, California-based gastroenterologist trained in AIIMS, Harvard, and Stanford Universities, sought to answer the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artContent"&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Are eggs good for breakfast?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The answer is a resounding yes, as Dr Sethi considers eggs to be one of the best proteins to have for the first meal of the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2.

Can eggs cause blood sugar spikes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs have almost zero carbohydrates and therefore cannot cause the blood sugar level to spike, explained Dr Sethi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Is it safe to have eggs with coffee or green tea?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs can be safely consumed with coffee or green tea, as no harmful interaction has been noted, shared Dr Sethi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Can eggs cause bloating?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eggs rarely cause bloating. However, some people are sensitive, and therefore it is better to trust our own gut in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Is it safe to eat raw eggs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consumption of raw eggs is not recommended as it has the risk of salmonella infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Are raw eggs better absorbed by the body?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi debunked the misconception, stating that cooked eggs have better protein absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. What is the best way to eat eggs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthiest preparations of eggs, according to Dr Sethi, include boiled, poached, scrambled and omelette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;11. How many eggs can we safely eat in a day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no magic number, most people do well with one to two whole eggs per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="content "&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p&gt;Pet parents often find it funny when their fur babies throw tantrums with their food bowl. This video shows an owner going through a similar experience. Their &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/shiba-inu"&gt;Shiba Inu&lt;/a&gt; dog named Gunner makes a big point by throwing his empty bowl repeatedly, showcasing his “passive aggressive” side. The pooch makes sure to do this activity in front of his human, presumably hinting at filling his bowl with food and snacks. In the caption of the dog bowl video, the uploader mentions, “Volume on to experience Gunner’s maximum discontent Does YOUR dog do this?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shiba-inu-passive-aggressively-shows-owner-his-bowl-is-empty"&gt;Shiba Inu ‘passive aggressively’ shows owner his bowl is empty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a funny and cute &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/203129-life-with-two-dogs-video"&gt;dog video&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram, a Shiba Inu named Gunner wins over the internet with his behavior. Explaining the context, an on-screen text reads, “My Shiba passive aggressively showing me his bowl is empty.” Then, the clip shows the fur baby throwing his bowl repeatedly on the floor. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It begins with him dragging the utensil from another room to the place where the owner is. His first throw makes a thud sound as it drops on the carpeted floor. Overall, he repeats the activity four times. In between the throws, Gunner makes sure that his pet parent is watching his tantrums.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While netizens may think the dog is asking for food or reminding his owner about his meal time, Gunner’s human clarifies in the caption. They mention, “Context: this was actually AFTER he has been fed. He brought his empty bowl to me hoping I would refill it for him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, viewers have enjoyed watching the dog and his food bowl video and have expressed their thoughts in the comments. A user quipped, saying that the bowl was at least made of “rubber.” Another found it relatable, but claimed that their dog throws items at them, not on the floor. Some commented with heart emojis and a sticker stating, “So Cute!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Faced with excruciating pain brought on by avascular necrosis (AVN), Mishcah Hamilton has found herself in a race against permanent immobility, requiring emergency hip-replacement surgery after suffering a total joint collapse because of sickle cell disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common but devastating complication of the disease, AVN is the death of bone tissue due to a loss of blood supply, causing the bone to weaken and potentially collapse, most commonly affecting the hip, knee, shoulder, or ankle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed with sickle cell at 10 months old, Hamilton, now 32 years old, said she was diagnosed with AVN in 2008, but noted that doctors determined at the time that surgery at 15 was dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am at stage five, so my femur has already collapsed and there’s degeneration of the bone. Now, my X-ray is showing that I have severe osteoarthritis due to the AVN. So it has progressed because I have sickle cell, which is a blood disorder. Enough blood is not going to the bone in the hip, causing the complication to develop,” Hamilton told &lt;b&gt;The Gleaner&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the condition has forced her out of several customer service and administrative jobs, disclosing that she has not been employed full time since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="jg-newsletter-sign-up" class="jg-newsletter-sign-up"&gt;

    &lt;/h2&gt;
    
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once independent, Hamilton said she is now forced to rely on a crutch for every step, using it to navigate a world that has become a minefield of “excruciating” pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, even the shortest distances hurt, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without it I have no balance. It stabilises my balance and helps me with mobility by taking the pressure off my hip,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, beyond her physical challenges, Hamilton said the constant threat of immobility has taken a toll on her mental health, noting that the unpredictability of the disease and the loss of her independence have left her grappling with a deep sense of hopelessness and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt; &lt;span class="allcaps"&gt;‘Hurts my quality of life’&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added to that, she said the complication has limited her ability to take care of her six-year-old autistic son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t even do the simplest tasks. Playing with him, moving about with him because, you know, boys play rough. Personal care is difficult. Bending to even put on my undergarment, to lotion my feet; it’s uncomfortable and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It hurts my quality of life. The severity of the pain plays on my mental health. Every day I’m in constant pain and at times, the medication does not help. I have insomnia at nights because of it,” said Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is seeking to raise US$25,000 (J$3.5 million) via fundraising platform GoFundMe to cover the cost of the surgical procedure, hip prosthesis, hospital stay, post-operative recovery care, follow-up medical appointments, physical therapy and rehabilitation, medication, and transportation related to treatment and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, she said the surgery is being pursued through private medical care, explaining that due to the progressive nature of the condition, her chronic pain and the level of joint damage, and current level of pain and joint damage, timing is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Public healthcare options often involve long waiting periods, sometimes extending many months or longer, which could worsen my condition and negatively affect recovery outcomes. Private care allows for earlier intervention, appropriate scheduling, and continuity of care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said her medical expenses have increased significantly since her last surgery in 2022 to replace her right hip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The financial burden is one I cannot manage alone,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a mother to my son, Micah, who is autistic, I carry the responsibility of providing daily care, stability, and support, while also managing a chronic illness. Living with ongoing pain and limited mobility can make even simple tasks challenging, yet my son depends on me every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This surgery is about more than my own healing; it is about restoring the strength and mobility I need to continue caring for him and being fully present in his life. Improving my quality of life also means being better able to support his needs, which is incredibly important to me,” said Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;
