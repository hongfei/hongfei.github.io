They found that the higher the levels of air pollution in a region, the more cancer-driving and cancer-promoting mutations were present in residents’ tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fine-particulate air pollution was in particular linked to mutations in the TP53 gene. These have previously been associated with tobacco smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People exposed to greater air pollution also had shorter telomeres, protective strands of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes, which are often compared with the caps on shoelaces. Premature shortening of telomeres is a sign of more rapid cell division, a hallmark of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is an urgent and growing global problem that we are working to understand,” said Dr Maria Teresa Landi, an epidemiologist on the study at the US National &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With smoking in decline in many parts of the world, including the UK and the US, people who have never smoked are making up a larger proportion of lung cancer patients. Current estimates suggest that 10-25% of lung cancers are now diagnosed in this group. Almost all such cancers are a form known as adenocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 2.5m new cases are diagnosed globally each year. More than a million of the deaths occur in China, where smoking, air pollution and other environmental contaminants are factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/09/air-pollution-causing-lung-cancer-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that the highest rates of adenocarcinoma attributable to air pollution were in east Asia. While cases in the UK were much lower, they still amounted to more than 1,100 new diagnoses a year, scientists found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest work, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09219-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, identified only a slight rise in cancer-causing mutations in people exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the study highlighted a significant risk from certain Chinese herbal medicines that contain aristolochic acid. Signature mutations linked to the herbal medicines were seen almost exclusively in never-smokers from Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another mysterious mutational signature was seen in people who had never smoked but not those who did, and was now the focus of “intense investigation”, Landi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOUFJqUEZMVDRyTVVxMm4yZWZJM3JVQ1E0RlZFcDVLVm5JbTd2N0JGWTZGazBjRzkxOFRjdnlNV0JJdkpRV01PeE1kNThBUFQtcmttcHpaLVA3dlgyMkxha3YtZ0xzXzVZdDVmcWhmTlkyWHE5UE93WFpvekFpSWJuRVY4RlVWZjA2NncybUZ1UkNjeC04OEVIQw</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，关于衰老的常见假设可能是错误的-独立报 | New study suggests common assumption about aging could be wrong - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPM1ZmcFNILWgxNGZiNUNnRm9mRGFkSXJIYWRGRkNhOWt6cHd4YnZFQ1ZxNmo5M0c1VlRVOTNmVmRVTDJoTW44SnlIY2tKeUMxUURKZjF5QlpLMjA2UHRsel9USl9OVEtGSTNqc0lQQzJxdU5XU1hXSWd2SExtWTg0WHNIVXV1M2ZfeFNqRkJ4b1J2bkM2Y1NNZmVpMHYwX0dHSFJXY01zVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Inflammation protects the body from injury or infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is thought to speed up the ageing process and contribute to various health conditions such as &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/alzheimers-dementia-research-protein-ptau217-b2780235.html"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;disease, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/arthritis-flare-up-symptoms-advice-summer-b2770041.html"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/bulletin/lifestyle/alcohol-smoking-overweight-early-death-b2778438.html"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6146930/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Researchers have long believed that most older people will suffer from inflammageing as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the study, published in Nature Age this week, found that people in nonindustrialized areas experience inflammation differently than those in urban areas and there may be another cause behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers&lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nature.com%252Farticles%252Fs43587-025-00888-0%26sref%3D%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammation-aging-cause-study-common-assumption-b2781348.html&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammation-aging-cause-study-common-assumption-b2781348.html&amp;amp;article_id=2781348&amp;amp;author=Madeline+Sherratt&amp;amp;tag=Inflammation%2Caging%2CHeart+Disease%2CBiology%2CType+2+diabetes&amp;amp;section=Health&amp;amp;category=N%2FA&amp;amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;amp;updated_time=2025-07-02T16%3A24%3A03.000Z&amp;amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=N%2FA&amp;amp;ref=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;amp;gclid=N%2FA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared the lives of two indigenous, nonindustrialized populations - the Tsimane from the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli from Peninsular Malaysia - with two groups from Italy and Singapore. Researchers compared blood samples from about 2,800 adults between 18 and 95 in the four groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that chronic inflammation may not be linked explicitly to ageing, but rather that diet, lifestyle and environmental factors are more significant factors than previously thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that inflammation in the nonindustrialized groups did not appear to increase as subjects got older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Cohen, associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University and co-author of the study, said the findings suggest inflammation is “more complex than we currently understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gWMNUM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24695"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Tsimane and Orang Asli differ from us in all these ways,” he told The Independent. “The insight of our study is not to say we need to be more active, but to challenge the idea that we understand biology well and can micromanage it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s a warning – don’t follow the latest trends of eating foods specifically to reduce inflammation, or whatever else the trend of the week may be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other experts shared a word of caution before jumping to conclusions from the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vishwa Deep Dixit, director of the Yale Center for Research on Aging, told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; it’s not surprising that people less exposed to pollution would see lower rates of chronic disease. The findings should lead to valuable discussion but would need further study “before we rewrite the inflammaging narrative,” professor of pharmacology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine Bimal Desai added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPM1ZmcFNILWgxNGZiNUNnRm9mRGFkSXJIYWRGRkNhOWt6cHd4YnZFQ1ZxNmo5M0c1VlRVOTNmVmRVTDJoTW44SnlIY2tKeUMxUURKZjF5QlpLMjA2UHRsel9USl9OVEtGSTNqc0lQQzJxdU5XU1hXSWd2SExtWTg0WHNIVXV1M2ZfeFNqRkJ4b1J2bkM2Y1NNZmVpMHYwX0dHSFJXY01zVQ</guid></item><item><title>根据新的研究，加工肉类没有安全的食用量- CNN | There is no safe amount of processed meat to eat, according to new research - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOTTNIempGeWhyQmZkNElDbWZWTENUbGU2bDJQVmVnZ280ZTdIOFNXalhKa2NRQVpXY3RSM1F4YWNqUVJTWmctRFNqQURlS0JKbnprRlJiSDNiLTk4WlRCTXl3ZzFJME9pZmlmQl81bUV2QVFsVFB4SDlBRmVtUmhhV0pEaElHeVJweGFF0gGQAUFVX3lxTE9XSWxVVXdFLWlyTl9MSHJHVHI1UHRFd0FXNlVBajVoV19ubzNVME9zQ2dEWVRwdkhaVDBQYk91LTF0TWFaSlY3eUh4RDNjb3VDdUpXOHpKclJlc1poRlNYY2ItSGNSVU5NYTVlaURwc1kyTnZkazYxWmpDTi0wd1ZIbTBzRmRQZjZFYnVuREpBLQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            There is strong evidence that there is “no safe amount” of processed meat to eat, nutrition experts say in response to a new study on the connection between diet and the risk of major diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The researchers also found elevated risks from the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjg00043b6mujuyn2nb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed data from more than 60 previous studies on the relationship between processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids in a person’s diet and their risk of type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and ischemic heart disease, which reduces blood supply to the heart and cuts off oxygen and nutrients, according to the study published Monday in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8#author-information" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00053b6moenjnd9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease and colorectal cancer,” said lead author of the study, Dr. Demewoz Haile, a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00063b6mmb5ywymh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data showed that people who ate as little as one hot dog a day when it comes to processed meats had an 11% greater risk of type 2 diabetes and a 7% increased risk of colorectal cancer than those who didn’t eat any. And drinking the equivalent of about a 12-ounce soda per day was associated with an 8% increase in type 2 diabetes risk and a 2% increased risk of ischemic heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00073b6mw9snhzpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This current research has shown, yet again and consistent with prior research … that to achieve health gains it is best to avoid or minimize the habitual consumption of each of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs),” said Dr. Nita Forouhi, head of nutritional epidemiology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00083b6moof2nam0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The risk increased as consumption increased; and for processed meat consumption, the data showed that there is no “safe amount,” she added in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00093b6m1rl5pv0m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first glance, the increase in risk seems modest and might look like the association is weak, said Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan Schoo of Public Healthl. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000a3b6m6hy79tqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we look at the actual data there, it’s really remarkably consistent and remarkably strong, and even in the lower dose of consumption, we can still see an increased risk of disease,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000b3b6mzfo2qee4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers examined dozens of earlier findings on diet and disease using a burden-of-proof method: a newer form of meta-analysis that not only tries to quantify an association across multiple studies but also accounts for the quality of each, Song said. “One caveat is it tends to give very conservative results,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000c3b6ms2vpk3wr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to note that the studies included in the analysis were observational, meaning that the data can only show an association between eating habits and disease –– not prove that what people ate caused the disease. They also relied on people recalling their dietary patterns, which can leave room for misremembering or misreporting, said Dr. Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000d3b6m4eo4udq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Utilizing even “the most sophisticated techniques does not really solve the problem that the information about diet is rather limited – which is obviously a big problem in nutritional epidemiology in general,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3hc1r000q3b6mm6tbqpos@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="why-meats-drinks-and-fats-are-linked-to-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Why meats, drinks and fats are linked to disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000e3b6m9kvq8fri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are many reasons why such foods could be associated with health problems. Sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meat –– such as sausages, bacon, salami and burgers –– can increase inflammation, which plays a big part in a variety of chronic diseases, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000f3b6mydnu1r33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Processed meats are also often cured with nitrite, which is converted to carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000g3b6mvi3tgb79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The problem with sugary drinks is that they are a quick way to consume large amounts of sugar, he added. Not only can that cause weight gain, but it also influences metabolic pathways that affect heart disease and diabetes risk, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000h3b6mwi2auqye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trans fatty acids reduce levels of good cholesterol and increase the bad, which is known to increase the risk of plaque buildup in arteries and heart disease, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000i3b6moz0ld5ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other potential connections to consider  are that people who are more likely to eat processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans-fats are often also at a higher risk of diseases because of “lifestyle factors (smoking, lack of exercise), but also social factors such as education and income, chronic stress and limited access to health care,” Kuhnle said. “It is very difficult to take these apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3hc2b000r3b6m32remwn2@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-to-avoid-and-what-to-add" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What to avoid and what to add
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000j3b6mcciskhye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the data can’t say reducing your consumption of these foods and drinks will cause a lower risk of the diseases, it does suggest that a reduction is a good idea, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000k3b6mulgciljj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sensible approach is to follow a varied and balanced diet that avoids excess, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000l3b6mc7j05o4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means people who drink a lot of sugary drinks should cut back, he said. It can also be helpful to avoid excess amounts of processed meats and avoid hydrogenated fats where possible –– although they are no longer as common as they used to be, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000m3b6m9mpbsly2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal shouldn’t be perfection but rather a healthy and sensible dietary pattern that allows room for enjoyment,” Kuhnle said.

            A good diet isn’t just about what to avoid. It’s also important to get good nutrients, Forouhi said. “Wider research has shown us that overall dietary patterns that include higher consumption of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and fermented dairy products like yogurt are good for health and longevity,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “My general advice: don’t panic,” Kuhnle said in an email. “Food is not just (a)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;source of nutrients –– it plays a central role in culture, pleasure, family life, and social connection. Reducing it solely to a list of health risks misses the bigger picture.”

They include medications like citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), and fluoxetine (Prozac), and millions of people take them every year in the U.S. While having extra serotonin floating around in your system — and thereby boosting your mood — is the primary effect of taking an SSRI, one potential side effect is that some of them might impact the system that the body uses to regulate temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ERBUPAZVDRFLVESMLTRZETVZTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“SSRIs are known to make people — not everybody — sweat excessively,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/gerard-sanacora/" target="_blank"&gt;Gerard Sanacora&lt;/a&gt;, professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine. “And in those people, there’s always the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/12/06/eight-cups-daily-water-intake/" target="_blank"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt;, especially on very hot days.” One 2005 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3931183/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that up to 20 percent of SSRI users might experience excessive sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FY5P47C2AZAKRNYYF44UUZRFMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s how SSRIs affect the body, especially when it’s hot outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QRVXSDRWW5FE7AQAZLLRWBMMMM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QRVXSDRWW5FE7AQAZLLRWBMMMM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The ways SSRIs impact your body in the heat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IW4YM7UPGZCYPP4B44M4AWVKHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;SSRIs can impact the function of the hypothalamus, a part of the brain responsible for temperature regulation, said &lt;a href="https://www.bmc.org/about-us/directory/doctor/christine-m-crawford-md-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Christine M.

Beta blockers, antihistamines, and even pain meds like acetaminophen, aspirin, and NSAIDs, can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/hcp/clinical-guidance/heat-and-medications-guidance-for-clinicians.html" target="_blank"&gt;cause heat intolerance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6FOLWHD4HJC3DCVTBOLKMZX36I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6FOLWHD4HJC3DCVTBOLKMZX36I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to stay safe in hot temps, on antidepressants or not&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VWJSJDTLBHQXGPORHR7ULIAAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No matter what the weather forecast looks like, don’t stop taking an SSRI&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;without the help of a health care provider&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E2QLZWDCDZF7NFAROVHJPVL5AE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You don’t want to stop treatment and then have more severe symptoms that could potentially lead to a mental health crisis,” Sanacora explained, adding that abruptly stopping an SSRI can make you feel even hotter than you might’ve felt while taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PFUARQJSBRCW3IWFJCBANSQGKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here are a few tips to keep safe in hot temperatures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ol class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="UGWV75TUHNAZXD2AK3HBI3A3XY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Talk to your health care provider. &lt;/b&gt;If you think your medication is making you excessively sweaty or uncomfortable in the heat, call your doctor, Sanacora said. They can potentially put you on a different medication or help you find another solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit your exposure on particularly sweltering days. &lt;/b&gt;“Try to stay out of the excessively hot weather if possible, and especially high humidity,” Sanacora said. “That combination of high temperature, high humidity makes it very hard to cool the body temperature.” If you have to be out when temps soar, try to take breaks in indoor malls, libraries, or any public air-conditioned facility. Here’s how to &lt;a href="https://nchh.org/information-and-evidence/learn-about-healthy-housing/emergencies/extreme-heat/cooling-centers-by-state/" target="_blank"&gt;find a local cooling center near you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay hydrated. &lt;/b&gt;Sanacora recommends keeping up on your fluid intake throughout the day — so your urine stays a pale yellow — and add in electrolytes if you’re going to be in excessive heat for long periods of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dress appropriately.&lt;/b&gt; “Wear clothes that can wick,” Sanacora said, adding that our body cools itself when sweat evaporates properly, so if perspiration is stuck to your skin (especially if you’re sweating more on an SSRI), you could feel a lot more uncomfortable. Opt for natural vs. synthetic fibers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let go of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;looking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; cool in favor of actually being cool. &lt;/b&gt;Crawford recommends a mini fan around your neck on hot days. You could even opt for a sun-shielding umbrella. (I’m a huge fan of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FROGG-TOGGS-Instant-reusable-Outdoors/dp/B002NGSB96/ref=sr_1_11?crid=1XTXP8YG4TGWN&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.J2ojeV8X-t8DYPG4I2GC0p5WITirGCNtb0NufXg7V-eE1GJ246ySze3bChPSHcdiEfT7Xkys9VqagiiLJ_7Hc4YeaVvlpuTLJ2sb76eDcmIyvuQFzbJ_W0yk57P4FXVnQGrQZVH98_-F77Fs4J_NPLTwj4GYISye61s9QO-OQ_X3RyZAYa6lcvnjoO3e_nmqn1cZrMJzZz2n_mIMEejP8qGDoSGTEkVi9X14tudOiMkk7snjf4bDbT6TWZmG4i9N_OphQTVtkj2W9-lCm6iCIcCROfpLuzYTPVLmqGtqutw.AH0GMOWHc3FIN54vD8yinqGLPgmpF2e7BZvR_gz06a4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=cooling+towel&amp;amp;qid=1750971843&amp;amp;sprefix=cooling+towel+amazon%2Caps%2C432&amp;amp;sr=8-11" target="_blank"&gt;cooling towels&lt;/a&gt;, which helped me survive a recent rim-to-rim Grand Canyon hike.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Know the signs of heat exhaustion. &lt;/b&gt;This includes dizziness, headache, nausea, reduced urine output, and an elevated body temperature. “If these signs are present, it is important to take steps to cool off before more serious complications of overheating emerge, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/06/heatstroke-exercise-brain-hot-weather/" target="_blank"&gt;heatstroke&lt;/a&gt;, which is characterized by confusion, excessive sweating or hot skin, but can progress to loss of consciousness, and seizures,” Krystal said. If your core body temp rises to 104 degrees (which can happen with heatstroke), it can damage the kidneys, brain, heart, and muscles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep your room cool at night&lt;/b&gt;. If you’re prone to night sweats, it’s extra important to stay hydrated throughout the day. Try to keep your bedroom as cool as possible — somewhere between 60 and 68 degrees — and crank a nearby fan on high. Avoid memory foam mattresses, as those can trap heat. As for sheets, skip satin and wool materials, and invest in linen over cotton. While linen can be expensive, it might be worth it if you are perspiring through your bedding. FYI: Night sweats can also be indicative of underlying hormonal shifts, like menopause and perimenopause, so talk with your doctor regardless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6HUNYI76LBA2NF3ZNVOG5GB4MA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While you may be at a slightly higher risk for heat-related illnesses, that shouldn’t deter you from getting on, or continuing, an antidepressant if you need one, Sanacora said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KZ66DK52VNFVDKASU7ZRFCWJHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You have to be really careful in excessively hot weather, regardless of whether you’re on an SSRI or not,” Sanacora said. “But you may want to even be a little bit extra careful if you are taking an SSRI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:02:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBvZUt3ODNZVGZySUlmWHhDMEY2bGI1VHA0NTB0VVlhQUtfVUZnc21jelAzN1dXNmxpM2lpdG82X2trSkw4aGF0dExUU3RnLWwwaWp3UzVjbVV2di0tUHdGQW5mLXVDZ25TV0pvQ0RXV2Z5cnEwVkRIVWxSM0d3UQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现运动Lifehack ：上床睡觉- Gizmodo | Scientists Uncover Exercise Lifehack: Go to Bed - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPMFJYTHVKbkpCSGQzTlhNV0F2dUc2M19Xd3pFbktaUEE3U19fUWU4V0FYdnNLbGhOWUFIbmotWTdaMTRQRWdRdEhQdGNLTlBCNllsYm9EbTdleFBwNjFSQUozYjFZWHZ4clVxMlJIRFdZM1d5c3R3aVR3b29CaDJ1OTFocw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;As if you needed another reason to envy—or loathe—morning people. Research this week shows that people who go to bed early are more likely to be physically active than those who crave the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Monash University in Australia led the study, which objectively examined people’s sleeping and exercise habits. Compared to late-night and typical sleepers, people who went to bed early tended to perform more physical activity the following day, they found. The findings also suggest that tweaking our bedtimes can indirectly help us stay more active, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Going to sleep earlier than usual may be an effective strategy to maintain normal sleep duration while also optimizing next-day [physical activity],” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2420846122"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regularly getting a good night’s sleep and exercising are both vital keys to better overall health. But according to the researchers, it’s still unclear exactly how these two aspects of our lives can interact with each other. The team was particularly interested in finding out whether the timing of people’s sleep can affect their exercise time, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They analyzed data from two earlier studies that tracked people’s waking and non-waking activity via wearables. In the first study, roughly 20,000 participants wore an activity tracker for an entire year, meaning the researchers had data covering roughly six million nights of sleeping. Across the whole sample, people’s average bedtime was around 11 p.m. Early sleepers were classified as people who turned in for bed around 9 p.m., whereas late sleepers went to bed around 1 a.m.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to late sleepers, early birds clocked 30 more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on average, the researchers found; they also exercised about 15 minutes more than the typical sleeper. These patterns remained stable when the researchers analyzed data from the second study that involved almost 6,000 people who wore FitBits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the study isn’t intended to answer why night owls might exercise less, the researchers have their educated guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Standard 9-to-5 routines can clash with the natural sleep preferences of evening types, leading to social jetlag, poorer sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness—which can all reduce motivation and opportunity for physical activity the next day,” said lead author Josh Leota, a scientist at Monash’s Sleep and Circadian Rhythms research program, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1089146"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our sleeping habits are influenced by many factors that aren’t easily adjusted, including the hours we work and our genetics. But there might be some hope for late birds who would like to exercise more. The researchers also found that people who slept earlier than their typical time, while still sleeping the same amount of hours as usual, tended to perform more physical activity the next day. In other words, it should be possible to work on our sleep and get more workout time all at once. And the researchers say that public health groups should try to emphasize both if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Rather than just promoting sleep and physical activity independently, health campaigns could encourage earlier bedtimes to naturally foster more active lifestyles. A holistic approach that recognizes how these two essential behaviors interact may lead to better outcomes for individual and community health,” said Leota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m all for getting more beauty rest and gym time.

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 &lt;strong&gt;StateViewer&lt;/strong&gt; is a cutting-edge AI tool developed by Mayo Clinic, capable of diagnosing nine types of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📈 The tool analyzes &lt;strong&gt;FDG-PET scans&lt;/strong&gt; and provides color-coded brain maps for easy interpretation by clinicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌍 With a global dementia burden affecting over &lt;strong&gt;55 million people&lt;/strong&gt;, StateViewer offers a scalable diagnostic solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 The tool boasts an impressive &lt;strong&gt;88% accuracy rate&lt;/strong&gt; and significantly improves diagnostic speed and precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, Mayo Clinic researchers have unveiled an innovative AI tool called &lt;strong&gt;StateViewer&lt;/strong&gt;, capable of diagnosing nine types of dementia using just one common brain scan. This technological marvel promises to revolutionize dementia diagnosis by providing faster and more accurate results than traditional methods. The significance of this tool lies in its potential to transform how clinicians approach dementia, offering hope for millions affected by these debilitating conditions. By leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms, StateViewer stands at the forefront of medical technology, paving the way for a future where early and precise diagnosis is within reach for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding StateViewer’s Advanced Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StateViewer tool operates by analyzing a &lt;strong&gt;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan&lt;/strong&gt;, which highlights how the brain utilizes glucose—a critical marker of brain activity. By comparing these scans to an extensive database of confirmed dementia cases, the AI can identify distinct patterns associated with various dementia types. For example, &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt; affects memory and cognitive processing areas, while &lt;strong&gt;Lewy body dementia&lt;/strong&gt; targets regions involved in attention and motor functions. &lt;strong&gt;Frontotemporal dementia&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, impacts language and behavior-related areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StateViewer presents its findings through &lt;i&gt;color-coded brain maps&lt;/i&gt;, enabling even general clinicians to grasp complex dementia patterns visually. Dr. David Jones, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic, emphasized the tool’s capacity to simplify the diagnostic process, allowing for more informed treatment decisions. “Every patient who walks into my clinic carries a unique story shaped by the brain’s complexity,” Dr. Jones noted, underscoring the tool’s potential to transform patient care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KUJUjaTrWl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/samsung-faces-a-shocking-setback-latest-smartphone-flops-so-hard-the-brand-is-forced-to-rethink-its-entire-strategy/"&gt;“Samsung Faces a Shocking Setback”: Latest Smartphone Flops So Hard the Brand Is Forced to Rethink Its Entire Strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tackling the Growing Dementia Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over &lt;strong&gt;55 million people worldwide&lt;/strong&gt; living with dementia and 10 million new cases annually, the burden of this condition is immense. Alzheimer’s disease alone ranks as the fifth-leading cause of death globally. Traditional diagnostic methods for dementia involve a battery of tests, including cognitive assessments, imaging, and consultations, making the process arduous and time-consuming. Despite these efforts, accurately distinguishing between overlapping dementia types remains challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jones, in collaboration with AI engineer Leland Barnard, recognized the urgent need for a more efficient diagnostic tool. “As we were designing StateViewer, we never lost sight of the fact that behind every data point and brain scan was a person facing a difficult diagnosis and urgent questions,” Barnard reflected. Their work highlights the critical role machine learning can play in enhancing clinical medicine by providing real-time insights and guidance to physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HZHC3M31Ua"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/canada-unleashes-tech-superpower-new-mega-hub-fuses-ai-quantum-computing-and-gpus-to-redefine-global-innovation/"&gt;“Canada Unleashes Tech Superpower”: New Mega Hub Fuses AI, Quantum Computing, and GPUs to Redefine Global Innovation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Potential of StateViewer in Clinical Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StateViewer’s introduction marks a significant step forward in the fight against dementia, offering a scalable solution that could democratize expert-level diagnostic support. The technology has been rigorously tested across &lt;strong&gt;3,600 brain scans&lt;/strong&gt;, demonstrating an impressive 88% accuracy rate in identifying the correct type of dementia. This represents a threefold increase in diagnostic accuracy compared to standard workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers are optimistic about expanding StateViewer’s use across diverse clinical environments. By doing so, they hope to facilitate earlier interventions and improve patient outcomes significantly. The tool’s success in various settings could redefine the treatment landscape for dementia, providing a model for integrating AI into everyday clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pthta2TRwJ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/robot-destroys-world-record-by-solving-rubiks-cube-faster-than-a-blink-leaving-even-experts-in-total-disbelief/"&gt;Robot Destroys World Record by Solving Rubik’s Cube Faster Than a Blink, Leaving Even Experts in Total Disbelief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking to the Future of Dementia Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As StateViewer continues to evolve, its potential impact on healthcare is profound. By enabling quicker and more precise diagnoses, the tool offers hope for earlier intervention and treatment, potentially altering the progression of these diseases. The study’s publication in the journal &lt;strong&gt;Neurology&lt;/strong&gt; underscores the tool’s scientific credibility and its promise in reshaping dementia care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new treatments for dementia emerge, tools like StateViewer will be crucial in ensuring timely and accurate diagnoses. This innovation raises an important question: &lt;i&gt;How will AI-driven diagnostics reshape our approach to complex medical conditions in the years to come?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the most nutritious foods on earth are also among the most affordable: beans, peas and lentils, collectively known as pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BBU6D52YPBEKPOK5N4G7M6XTWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pulses are high in protein and fiber.

Studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;have also found&lt;/a&gt; that beans, peas and lentils have a low carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FHQMLZZJR5BU3BN4C2DGH5LTQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Health authorities recommend that adults eat one to three cups of beans, peas or lentils each week, depending on your calorie needs. Yet most Americans fall short of that goal, consuming on average just a half cup of beans each week, said Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IFZPY67ORBCTXJUBSLJJO3Q53Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That’s an insanely small amount, given that beans, peas and lentils are such a powerhouse of protein and fiber and other nutrients,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2HYSEMT4Y5FG5BDZIBU6KTASRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Gardner was part of a government committee of nutrition experts that issued &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/12/11/ultraprocessed-foods-plant-protein-dietary-guidelines/" target="_blank"&gt;a report in December&lt;/a&gt; that said that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans should emphasize beans, peas and lentils as a healthy source of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and a good substitute for red and processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2BXGHSFNTZHG7MCOEQGGVWHXUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He said that adults should aim to eat at least a half cup of beans, peas or lentils per day — rather than per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUAXWMPQK5ANXNQ5CQS4D3KCDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We should be doubling and tripling our bean intake — we should be eating them every day,” Gardner said. “Nutrient-wise they have all of the good stuff and none of the bad stuff — and they tend to be a lot less expensive than other foods. There are few foods that cost as little as beans, peas and lentils.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="N2RF2CNOLZDOPMBL6Q7UBMCEB4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="N2RF2CNOLZDOPMBL6Q7UBMCEB4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How eating beans can make you healthier&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6S76RUTT7BBW7AZPJDMNMOBNPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pulses are the dried edible seeds found in the pods of a group of plants called legumes, which are among the oldest cultivated crops on earth. Across the globe, nearly every culture includes some type of pulse or legume in their traditional cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ETGXH7EHMZA5THT3MXLBCJZ7RY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That may be in part because of their nutrient density. Pulses typically have several times more protein and fiber than brown rice, corn, wheat and other grains. A single cup of cooked lentils, for example, has 18 grams of protein, the amount in three large eggs. Yet unlike animal foods, they’re naturally free of cholesterol and low in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JIIDF6247ZHLNEOVGPWJWGQI2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;All pulses are high in fiber and rich in nutrients such as iron, potassium, magnesium and B vitamins. A cup of cooked lentils &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/06/psyllium-supplement-how-much/" target="_blank"&gt;has 16 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; — more than half the recommended daily amount of fiber that the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label" target="_blank"&gt;average adult needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VLHM5GTYZJGKJDSOT5XKP6S4B4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2020, a systematic &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2020.1716680" target="_blank"&gt;review of randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; found that adults who were assigned to eat an average of about a half-cup of cooked beans, peas or lentils daily had striking improvements in their cardiovascular, gut and metabolic health. They lost weight, shrank their waistlines and lowered their cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar levels. They also had reductions in inflammation and positive changes in their &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/14/im-gastroenterologist-here-are-8-tips-improve-your-gut-health/" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BXWQ2N4TOZHIHFZSOHWMUAXCBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers speculated that the health benefits were in large part a result of the ample amounts of fiber in pulses. Beans, peas and lentils contain a special type of fiber called resistant starch, which gets its name because it resists digestion in the small intestine. Resistant starch travels down to the large intestine, where it’s metabolized by gut bacteria that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35565693/" target="_blank"&gt;convert it into health-promoting compounds&lt;/a&gt; such as short-chain fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SNMDI2X4YJBURNMVWR4HE57T24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The authors of the review also looked into potential downsides. Although beans have a reputation for causing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/25/why-farts-gas-smell-bad/" target="_blank"&gt;flatulence&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found that cases of gastrointestinal discomfort were fairly rare and not severe. “None of the participants withdrew from the studies because of these symptoms,” the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7SJQBQTVRBDZRGULLLW42PLS6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you are concerned about gastrointestinal issues, though, one of the best things you can do is to gradually increase the amount of beans, peas and lentils in your diet. This will give your body time to adjust to the increase in fiber, and as your tolerance rises, any initial increase in flatulence should dissipate, said Chris Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at the University of Washington Medical Center and the author of &lt;a href="https://gutbites.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Gut Bites MD&lt;/a&gt;, a blog on gut health and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WR66BZBDJZBPBKKFDJKMQER7SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The mantra is to go low and go slow,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="7PUJAXDSMNAWDJ4HTZDTTVCWIU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="7PUJAXDSMNAWDJ4HTZDTTVCWIU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Better for your budget and the environment&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JROWOPPCWVGVTELUW35BEA2NQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Damman said that when people ask him what they should eat to improve their health, he recommends beans, peas and lentils “above all other foods,” for both their nutrient content and their low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJ3S56FFVFBGPIOF6VZMKVYOVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They’re a superfood,” he said. “They’re healthy, but they’re also affordable — and that’s really important right now with inflation and today’s economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U7GYD6IXHRFULFRYMQPAJVSCFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that pulses are among the lowest-cost sources of protein, with their average prices significantly below that of chicken, beef, pork, turkey, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/11/healthiest-seafood-fish-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;seafood&lt;/a&gt;, nuts, seeds and lamb.

Growing pulses uses less water and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;produces fewer&lt;/a&gt; greenhouse gas emissions compared with meat production.

Pair them with black beans by trying this &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/black-bean-breakfast-burritos/" target="_blank"&gt;Washington Post recipe&lt;/a&gt; for high-protein, freezer friendly breakfast burritos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having a sandwich for lunch, add some chickpeas by smearing hummus on your bread instead of mayonnaise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having chicken salad, open a can of white beans and mix some in. “Soft white cannellini beans are really good with tuna or chicken salad,” Weisenberger said. Just make sure to rinse your beans first, which helps to remove sodium, she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re making a salad, open a can of cooked beans, peas or lentils and toss a couple spoonfuls in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/13/legume-pasta-edamame-low-carb/" target="_blank"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt; with tomato sauce for dinner, open a can of kidney beans and mix some in. The taste and texture of the kidney beans will complement the sauce, Weisenberger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making chili, soup or stew for a big family dinner? Smash some white beans, and add them to the pot. The smashed beans will thicken up your stew, soup or chili, and no one will even realize they’re in there, Weisenberger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anytime you’re making a recipe with ground beef, replace some of the beef with cooked brown lentils to stretch the meat and add some fiber and extra nutrients. Brown lentils have a mild flavor, and they resemble the appearance and texture of cooked ground beef. Try adding the cooked lentils in a 2-to-1 ratio with the ground beef (2 cups of cooked lentils for each pound of cooked ground beef). You can do this to make burgers, Bolognese, taco meat and even sloppy joes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AXAD35OE5EKLCFYCB5M2WWHPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With so many varieties of beans, peas and lentils, there are endless ways to consume them. You can use hummus as a dip for chips and veggies or snack on &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/02/28/how-to-make-crispy-roasted-chickpeas/" target="_blank"&gt;roasted chickpeas &lt;/a&gt;instead of potato chips. (You can &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/crispy-spiced-roasted-chickpeas/" target="_blank"&gt;roast them at home&lt;/a&gt; on a baking sheet, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Saffron-Road-Organic-Chickpeas-Gluten-Free/dp/B01MCXFV4X/ref=asc_df_B01MCXFV4X" target="_blank"&gt;buy them online&lt;/a&gt; or at your grocery store.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HXPXU277BDWNPGG7PONZZ57RQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re making food at home, there is almost always a way to add beans, peas or lentils to your meal, Weisenberger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XYDDH6MWJAVHOONNRJVM7CNZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You can eat them with Mexican flavors, Italian flavors, Asian flavors,” she added. “One of the best things about them is that they’re so versatile.

Sugar is woven into just about everything we eat, from your morning granola to that innocent-looking salad dressing. But according to Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a Harvard-trained doctor and wellness expert, ditching sugar for just 30 days might be one of the best things you can do for your body. And no, it’s not just about losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent video that’s now buzzing across health circles online, Dr. Sethi breaks down exactly what happens when you give up added sugars for a month—and the benefits are more than skin deep. We're talking about major changes inside your body, the kind you won't see on the scale but will feel in your energy, focus, and even long-term disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Your liver fat starts to drop"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sethi explains that when you quit sugar, especially fructose-heavy processed sugar, your liver fat starts to drop. That’s a big deal, considering fatty liver disease is becoming alarmingly common—even in people who don’t drink alcohol. Just a month without added sugar can reduce liver inflammation and start reversing early signs of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Kidney function improves, especially if you are insulin resistant or pre-diabetic"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re insulin resistant, pre-diabetic, or just on the blood sugar rollercoaster more often than you’d like to admit, quitting sugar can actually improve kidney function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because excess sugar and high insulin levels can strain the kidneys over time. Give them a break, and they bounce back surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Inflammation in your artery goes down"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the less talked-about benefits of ditching sugar is how much it helps your arteries. Chronic sugar intake leads to inflammation in your arterial walls, which is one of the sneaky precursors to heart disease. Cut the sugar, and those inflamed pathways begin to calm down, reducing your risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Clearer thinking and better focus"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like your brain is in a fog after dessert? Turns out, it’s not just in your head—well, it is, but not your imagination. Dr. Sethi says that mental clarity and focus improve significantly when sugar is out of the picture. Your brain thrives on stable energy, and sugar spikes followed by crashes don’t help. After a few weeks without sugar, many people report better productivity and a noticeable boost in concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Your immune system gets stronger, because sugar weakens white blood cells"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to fight off that seasonal bug or recover faster from illness? Your immune system needs to be in top shape. Here’s the kicker: sugar weakens your white blood cells, the front-line defenders of your immune system. In just 30 days without added sugar, your immune system becomes noticeably more resilient, which is especially helpful in today’s post-pandemic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"You can retain more key minerals like magnesium, calcium and zinc"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hidden perk? Your body becomes better at holding onto essential minerals like magnesium, calcium, and zinc when there’s no sugar messing with your metabolism. These minerals are crucial for everything from bone health to muscle recovery to keeping your mood in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you break up with sugar for 30 days? According to Dr. Sethi, your body goes through a major internal reboot—your liver trims down, your brain sharpens, your immune system strengthens, and your organs get a much-needed breather. It’s not about punishment or restriction—it’s about giving your body the space to heal and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s the best part: you don’t have to quit sugar forever. But even a month-long break can lead to real, tangible improvements in your health. Think of it as a detox your future self will thank you for—one cup of unsweetened tea at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you eat fruits?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During a sugar-free challenge, most whole fruits are absolutely fine to enjoy! They contain natural sugars, but they’re packed with fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants—all of which are great for your health. However, you might want to avoid high-sugar fruits like grapes, super-ripe bananas, and mangoes. Instead, focus on lower-sugar fruits like berries, apples, or pears. Also, avoid fruit juices and dried fruits," Dr Sethi explained to one user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8gFBVV95cUxQNlphcThHbGFWVzFZRjNGWlRwdmNlTmZxMHJmVHJ3OXZFQjZlRTRVM3JSZFZLbFJBSy05eVdoYlh5MkJfbTc2ejg5ZGVHMmpHUmVncDBwb3gwYnJvV3V4dnc1U3Z4dU1iRFlGTU1HbVBVeGdvR3pwT3AzRjFnUFN2STRDeW9iY0Nrcm9qMExBMDFueVF5RlpKNGo2VVVYdkNnUlZsdk5zTWdZYkxjZmdMaGRVek5LMTRJbGJYa2o4MUZsNExydS1nWkt5S21mMGsySy1JZHIxRm01NUtlYm5XYjFSYnMzVFpEUlROT3hGd0drdw</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员表示，汉密尔顿县细小病毒的“感染爆发” -辛辛那提WCPO 9 | 'Infection outbreak' of parvovirus in Hamilton County, health officials say - WCPO 9 Cincinnati</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQRi0yYXRsdjNwNmJMVW5lZWZIbC1xOElSanczNnNnWkpfMG1IODJmM1FzT1pCdV8xdk5oRV82QmZTUWc0Y01BN1BHUHU5Sl9TdXAxV1VoZHhkRnpQRmNxMnFnYklOajV5S3VXTFUxbXZrc05rd1ZTZ243bEFHRU4wczYwcnV1by1aZGpSZWN6UDNQd2lRdjlFUFBGUkVxZWpCM3FYWTlqYnQ1dl9wQVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI — Medical experts at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center say there is a "parvovirus infection outbreak" happening in Hamilton County, according to the Cincinnati Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the virus is not typically serious, but can be dangerous to unborn babies and those with blood disorders or weakened immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parvovirus infection is an illness caused by the virus called parvovirus B19, also called Fifth Disease. It's commonly encountered in the community, especially among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outbreaks can happen frequently among school-aged children who may present with a lacy rash (described as a 'slapped cheek' appearance when it involves the face) and flu-like symptoms," said Kara Markham, M.D. and professor of obstetrics and gynecology, in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cincinnati Health officials said parvovirus infections usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are milder and flu-like, with rashes and joint pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markham said one-third to two-thirds of pregnant women are not immune to the virus at the start of pregnancy, which means if they contract parvovirus, it's possible the virus can spread to the baby as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that's not typically common, the CDC says the infection can cause a miscarriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a woman is first exposed to parvovirus during pregnancy, the virus can cross the placenta to cause fetal infection," said Markham. "If this occurs, the virus can temporarily affect the bone marrow of the baby, preventing the baby from producing red blood cells and/or platelets." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can then result in anemia in the case of a lack of red blood cells, or thrombocytopenia in the case of a lack of platelets, Markham said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is estimated that severe anemia can occur in up to 10% of babies infected prior to 20 weeks and the condition may even be severe enough to cause fetal death," said Markham. "However, if physicians are aware of the infection and the potential for fetal anemia, very close monitoring and appropriate treatment can be lifesaving for the baby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies who survive do so without long-term issues, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many people don't exhibit symptoms of the infection, those who do will experience them roughly five to 10 days after contact with the virus, according to the Mayo Clinic. Early symptoms of the infection in children can include a fever, upset stomach, headache, runny nose and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic says children infected with parvovirus may also exhibit the face rash, which is red on light-colored skin and can be purplish and harder to see on darker-colored skin. Over time, a second rash can form on the arms, legs, chest, back and buttocks of the child, according to the Mayo Clinic. That rash usually goes away in seven to 10 days, but it can come and go for up to three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with parvovirus infections are more likely to get painful, swollen or stiff joints; joint symptoms can be more common in women than men, according to the Mayo Clinic. Those symptoms often affect the hands, wrists, knees, ankles and feet and can last roughly one to three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

But it’s often the most important thing they came in for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with &lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;just one more thing&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ravindra recalls patients who revealed—as she had one foot out the door—that they’d been experiencing chest pain. Or they were struggling with their mental health and wanted to get her opinion on going on an antidepressant. It’s better to blurt these things out than hide them from your doctor altogether. But the problem is that “we want to be able to pay as much attention as possible to the things that are most important to patients, and that are most important to their health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a patient mentions something worthy of deeper discussion as an appointment is wrapping up, Ravindra has to make a split-second decision: Should she dive into a conversation with them, and be late to see the next patient (and the one after that)? Or should she ask them to schedule another appointment to discuss whatever they brought up? “Then you risk patients feeling dismissed,” she says. “They made the decision to finally talk about it, and I'm asking them to talk about it another time.” Neither option is ideal, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7208914/symptoms-doctors-dismiss-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melinda Steele, a primary care physician in California, can relate. “The ‘just one more thing’ scenario happens &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the time,” she says. It can throw off her entire day. “Doctors are like ducks: We’re calm and collected on the surface, but we’re moving it under the water,” she says. “We’re getting blasted from all different directions, having to triage things, go through messages and labs, and see patients in clinic. It’s better to not be surprised by a doozy when you're trying to get out the door.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make sure you feel heard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid falling into the “just one more thing” trap, make sure you’re prepared for doctor’s appointments. Steele suggests making a list of concerns to bring along. Cap it at about three discussion points, and star the top couple things you’d like to discuss, so they get priority over less important issues. “A lot of people come to the doctor's office and they're nervous and forget what they want to bring up, so writing it down can offload some of that and make sure the issues are actually addressed,” she says. “If you have symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, move them to the top of the list and mention them up front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7297252/permethrin-ticks-mosquitoes-insecticide/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Experts Use to Repel Ticks and Mosquitoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Experts Use to Repel Ticks and Mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to work on getting out of the habit of what Steele calls “problem hoarding.” There’s no need to stockpile issues until you have “enough” to justify a visit. “It's pretty common for people to come in with a big list of issues, because they feel like there needs to be enough to justify taking time off work,” she says. “Reaching out to your doctor earlier and tackling issues earlier can definitely prevent complications”—and ensure appointments are as seamless and satisfying as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea, Ravindra says, is to add notes when you schedule your appointment via your online portal. Many systems allow you to enter text describing what you'd like to talk about, and she always reviews them in advance. “Then I have a good sense of, is this going to be a quick, straightforward visit? Or do I need to make sure I allow adequate time?” she says. Plus, people who are nervous about bringing up sensitive topics in-person often feel more at ease putting them on their doctors’ radar virtually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What doctors can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of every appointment, Ravindra asks patients: “What’s on your mind today? Is there anything you want to specifically make sure we cover?” That helps reduce the possibility of being blindsided by “just one more thing" at the end of the allotted time, she’s found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele advises doctors ask patients if they brought a list of concerns, and if so, whether they can look at it together while setting an appointment agenda. “Skim it with the patient, because then you can highlight, ‘Oh, I see you have chest pain as No. 15. Why don't we move that up to the top?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7270606/questions-to-ask-doctor-appointment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 Questions You Should Always Ask at Doctors’ Appointments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 Questions You Should Always Ask at Doctors’ Appointments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also urges clinicians to avoid falling into a rabbit hole and going deep on the first issue a patient brings up. “Doctors are fix-it people,” she says. “We’re listening, but our minds are thinking and strategizing, ‘What could be causing these symptoms, and what am I going to do about it?’” Yet it’s best to hold off on problem-solving until you’ve talked through and ranked a patient’s issues by urgency and priority, she tells doctors, so that an entire appointment isn't accidentally focused on one problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and just one more thing—keep in mind that both doctors and patients have the same achievable goal. “At the end of the day, patients want to be heard and cared for, and doctors want the exact same thing” for their patients, Steele says. “Communicating effectively is going to be the best approach for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondering what to say in a tricky social situation?

The findings show that drinking a modest dose of peppermint tea improved several types of cognitive performance compared to a placebo. These benefits were accompanied by increased blood flow in the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain responsible for functions such as attention and working memory. But unexpectedly, these vascular changes did not explain the improvements in cognition, suggesting that other mechanisms may be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that peppermint can improve attention, working memory, and even mood. Some scientists have proposed that these benefits arise because peppermint increases cerebral blood flow, especially in the prefrontal cortex. This would allow more oxygen and nutrients to reach the brain, potentially enhancing mental performance. Others have pointed to peppermint’s active ingredients, such as menthol, which may influence neurotransmitter systems involved in cognition. The current study aimed to test whether improved blood flow really acts as a bridge between peppermint and better thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The project was conceptualized and executed by my master’s student, Luka Netzler, who has now gone onto to study for a PhD,” explained corresponding author Brian Lovell, an associate professor at Northumbria University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cognitive enhancing effects of peppermint are well established, but little attention has been paid to the possible mechanisms, particularly neurovascular mechanisms, that might underlie these effects. Here, we wanted to explore this more, asking whether acute (short term) positive changes in cognition, particularly memory and attention, following consuming small amounts of peppermint team might be mediated by increased oxygenated blood flow to the prefrontal cortex, assessed with fNIRS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers at a UK-based institution recruited 25 healthy adult volunteers, aged between 20 and 56 years, and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. One group consumed a cup of peppermint tea, while the other received a placebo—a cup of warm water that participants were told contained peppermint extract. This single-blind design ensured that participants were unaware of which condition they were in, helping to control for expectation effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a battery of computerized tasks both before and after drinking their assigned beverage. These tasks measured a range of mental functions, including memory, attention, and visuospatial processing. For example, the picture recall task tested episodic memory by asking participants to recognize previously viewed images. Another task, called serial threes, required participants to subtract three repeatedly from a large number, which tests attention and working memory. The study also included tasks for short-term word recall and visuospatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, researchers used near-infrared spectroscopy, or NIRS, to monitor changes in brain activity by measuring blood oxygenation levels. This non-invasive method tracks the relative concentrations of oxygenated and total hemoglobin in the brain and is especially well suited to measuring blood flow in the prefrontal cortex. Measurements were taken both at rest and during task performance, both before and after the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants who drank peppermint tea performed better on all four cognitive tasks after consumption. They showed greater improvements in episodic memory, working memory, short-term word recall, and visuospatial memory compared to the placebo group. These differences were statistically significant and consistent across the different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the placebo group actually showed a slight decline in performance on some tasks during the second round of testing, which might reflect the effects of fatigue or reduced motivation—something that peppermint appears to have buffered against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cognitive improvements, those in the peppermint group also showed increased blood oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex. Two key markers of hemodynamic activity—oxygenated hemoglobin and total hemoglobin—were significantly higher after drinking peppermint tea. These effects were not observed in the placebo group, supporting the idea that peppermint promotes greater cerebral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peppermint, consumed as a tea, engenders short term improvements in cognition, particularly memory and attention,” Lovell told PsyPost. “Our protocol did not permit us to investigate the sustainability of these beneficial cognitive effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the researchers found no connection between changes in blood flow and improvements in cognitive performance. Statistical analyses showed that the rise in blood oxygenation did not predict how much a participant’s memory or attention improved. Even after adjusting for blood flow changes, the cognitive benefits of peppermint remained significant. This suggests that increased blood flow is not the reason why peppermint improves thinking, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result was somewhat surprising to the research team, who had expected blood flow to play a mediating role. It’s possible that the small sample size limited their ability to detect a relationship, Lovell said. Larger studies are generally needed to test mediation effects reliably, especially when the links between variables are subtle. The researchers also noted that the way NIRS data was handled may have influenced the outcome. Future studies might benefit from more detailed analyses of the timing and location of blood flow changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One alternative explanation is that peppermint affects brain chemistry in ways that are independent of blood flow. Menthol, a major compound in peppermint, interacts with receptors involved in the cholinergic system, which plays a key role in learning and memory. Menthol may help preserve acetylcholine levels in the brain by blocking enzymes that break it down, enhancing the transmission of signals between neurons. It also activates certain receptor channels that influence alertness and sensory processing. These chemical pathways may offer a better explanation for peppermint’s cognitive effects than changes in blood supply alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings are in line with previous work showing that peppermint can sharpen mental performance. Unlike many earlier studies that used peppermint aroma, this one used a relatively small dose of peppermint tea—just 200 milliliters. The low dose and simple preparation suggest that peppermint may be a practical and natural tool for improving cognitive performance in everyday settings. The fact that the placebo group’s performance declined on some tasks while the peppermint group improved raises the possibility that peppermint may help combat short-term mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the authors caution that the study has limitations. Most notably, the sample size was small, and the design only assessed short-term effects. It is unknown how long the cognitive benefits of peppermint might last. The study also did not control for participants’ diet, caffeine intake, or physical activity, all of which can influence cognition and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also raises questions for future research. For instance, if blood flow is not the mediator, what is? Further studies could explore other physiological or chemical processes, such as changes in neurotransmitters, that might account for the observed effects. It may also be useful to test different doses of peppermint or to examine whether specific compounds in the plant are more responsible for its benefits. Menthol is likely not the only active ingredient—peppermint contains a range of other chemicals, including menthone and limonene, which might also influence brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, Lovell said he hopes to build on these results by conducting larger studies with more post-intervention assessments and more precise imaging techniques. By examining how different compounds in peppermint affect the brain and how long the benefits last, they aim to better understand the potential of this everyday herb to support cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hup.70005" target="_blank"&gt;A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial Exploring the Short-Term Cognitive and Cerebrovascular Effects of Consuming Peppermint Tea: A Mediation Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Luka Netzler and Brian Lovell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:09:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPc3dPVEEtMkRpUG8tZHA2aTdzWlFNS1JJNmRuY0lZWldwU1FiUlkwUGxvcndPR2NnaTNIelltSmQxMGo3ZW5kN1A0NkNXRWhPbVlINGJ3WWtnQW5rVWNUSzBKOTNzdkNmRng5QXpveFNzMHFpYVpmSGNoVE44X2tkUg</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现流行的维生素靶向可见的衰老迹象，使皮肤看起来更年轻-预防 | Scientists Find Popular Vitamin Targets Visible Signs of Aging, Makes Skin Look Younger - Prevention</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQcGFRRXNCUVkzZGVfbU5PSllGckQ4WFdnbld0QUJ1NXJQYzgxVFdNbi1zUXhZUmc3c29Zc2E3RlJMdHRZUHdnYTQxdUJhVGJCVndxWGVWVjVyTXFXV2c0bWI4VkNKNS1jSG5MNG9fbklCUHpQbkEzTWdnTWNqRXkzMzNEaUlaUXBJRjItNXViS2VmcjJNVnp3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="0" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.0"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.0.0"&gt;Vitamin C may help support the health of the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.1"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.1.0"&gt;Getting adequate levels of vitamin C may help fight signs of skin aging, according to recent findings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="0.2"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="0.2.0"&gt;Doctors explain how to get more of the essential vitamin in your diet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr data-node-id="1" class="css-18pb4rg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Your skin protects your body from germs and other environmental hazards, but it gets weaker over time.

The researchers also found that skin samples that were treated with vitamin C had more cell proliferation, which is important for maintaining the skin’s healthy barrier and creating a fresher look.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Vitamin C is a promising molecule that can be used as a developing treatment for epidermal thinning, including in aging,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The findings raise questions about the impact of vitamin C on skin. So, should we all be having more of it in our lives for a healthier, younger-looking complexion? Here’s what dermatologists want you to keep in mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-vitamin-c-and-what-does-it-do" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;What is vitamin C and what does it do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Vitamin C, a.k.a. L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin. Humans need to get vitamin C from food and supplements, making it a vital part of the diet, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institutes of Health" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Vitamin C plays a role in several areas of health, including biochemical reactions to support collagen and protein metabolism, per the NIH.

While many adults in the U.S. get the recommended amounts of vitamin C daily from foods and drinks, some are more at risk of not getting enough than others, per the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NIH" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt;.

Because of vitamin C’s antioxidant effect, these can help to protect the skin from environmental stressors, she says, which may contribute to signs of aging. (Dr. Rodney recommends looking for a serum with vitamin C and ferulic acid, which helps keep the vitamin C molecule stable in your products.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Overall, dermatologists say the findings stress the importance of eating a healthy diet for good skin health. “Nutrition has a direct impact on skin health,” Dr. Goldenberg says. “Nutrients like vitamin C can promote skin regeneration, delay aging effects, and maintain barrier function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="28.0"&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.

But this was not linked to increased cognitive decline in this study; speaking slowly seemed to be more significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, how fast participants were able to name pictures predicted how fast they spoke in general, and both were linked to executive function,” &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/v" target="_blank" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Neuroscience News says" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6865008fe4b01e8bcb42385e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/v" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Neuroscience News says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, it’s not how long people paused to find a word; it’s how fluent and fast their speech was afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jed Meltzer, the study’s lead author, said: “Our results indicate that changes in general talking speed may reflect changes in the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that mean slow talkers definitely have dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. This association needs more research, the scientists say; it is only linked to cognitive decline, which is associated with dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not proof of dementia in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Dr Meltzer says, it could help with &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/why-early-dementia-diagnosis-matters_uk_685bba1de4b04f1da81ce183" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="crucial early diagnosis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6865008fe4b01e8bcb42385e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="685bba1de4b04f1da81ce183" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;crucial early diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This [study] suggests that talking speed should be tested as part of standard cognitive assessments to help clinicians detect cognitive decline faster and help older adults support their brain health as they age,” he told &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/speech-speed-brain-health-aging-25661/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Neuroscience News." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6865008fe4b01e8bcb42385e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://neurosciencenews.com/speech-speed-brain-health-aging-25661/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Neuroscience News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost UK</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 11:10:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPdnFhd3ZzWkFUUkNMYlNLeUxJbVE4VVM1Q0FxdU1LVFF1QmMweFlrSWNTTXJIRl83LUg4RjhNazdzdTNDS0NYUUtDdmVMWFFVd09zTmVSeXZnNjdjNlpVMlFTbjdlaGY5YS1wRkE2dUJ3M2R1YUpjc3FOT0FORnNQZU9fR3pqajNmSU5vRW9PbktXVUxtcEpoaWd2bmFrdHc00gGnAUFVX3lxTE9ibzlxbXQxcW5Hd2ROOUFHQUZyZjZ0RWZfYW1lY3dBbW1Wc1REalJIZ0NDVWRGVTQzanZJRXhsRVVSaFJDSEVvQWtuY0FCaVB2S19kY3pPeXJPdTI2NzJIRHNIMV9tU20xbnp4TVhfVkZqZFB1RmcwdXpLOTU2VUtTUFhOOEM4MFRUSTc1MXB2TWpEOFJ2STVSRmJ4anJBWVRnWndnZVM0</guid></item><item><title>洛杉矶火灾后，空气中发现了一种新的有毒金属。没人知道它来自哪里-旧金山纪事报 | A new toxic metal has been found in the air after L.A. fires.

                &lt;p&gt;I paused, and then I clicked "cancel appointment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood in my stool, the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;most common sign of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; in young people, was going away. I chalked up my concerns to my job: I was interviewing &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-years-of-stomach-pain-diagnosed-colon-cancer-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, the symptoms were on my mind a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a year later, the bleeding kept coming back, and more prominently than before. Sometimes, I also had other colon cancer symptoms, such as inconsistent bowel movements. From writing more about &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-cases-doubled-young-people-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, I heard more stories of healthy young patients having barely any warning signs, only to be &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-stage-4-colon-cancer-symptoms-pain-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diagnosed at stage 4&lt;/a&gt;. And then, my grandfather was diagnosed with stage 1 colon cancer in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I still had reservations about getting a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed expensive and intense for just one symptom. At the same time, that symptom seemed to be getting worse after a year, and I now had a family history of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I got a colonoscopy and am so glad I did — even if I'm still navigating the financial side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1ef18b2f-323a-44bc-8ebc-81e29713dbe7" data-toc-id="1ef18b2f-323a-44bc-8ebc-81e29713dbe7"&gt;Colonoscopy or stool test?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I booked a GI appointment after reading &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/katie-couric-shares-early-colon-cancer-signs-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;about stool tests&lt;/a&gt;, which can detect cancer via stool samples. It seemed minimally invasive while still taking some sort of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At my appointment, I'd hoped my age, lifestyle, and lack of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;more severe symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as abdominal pain would sway my doctor to recommend the stool test over the colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Stool tests such as Cologuard are good at detecting cancer but not preventing it.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Cologuard
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But as a representative of Cologuard later told me, stool tests aren't recommended for screening people who have &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;symptoms. The representative also said they're meant for people ages 45 and older who are considered at average risk. This is because stool tests can detect only cancer itself. It was possible that I had &lt;a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-had-potentially-precancerous-polyp-removed-in-colonoscopy-2021-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}'&gt;precancerous polyps&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which wouldn't show up in a stool test but could be safely removed and biopsied in a colonoscopy. Plus, colonoscopies can identify other issues, such as &lt;a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}'&gt;hemorrhoids or inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;, with symptoms similar to those of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My GI performed a quick rectal exam and didn't find anything. She said that given my age, the bleeding was probably caused by internal hemorrhoids or polyps, not cancer. She recommended I get a colonoscopy and some blood work to test my iron levels, which could also &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colorectal-cancer-high-mortality-young-people-signs-symptoms-disease-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;point to colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. I booked a colonoscopy for three weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="61e14b27-7b74-4479-987c-e3d17f5ce718" data-toc-id="61e14b27-7b74-4479-987c-e3d17f5ce718"&gt;I was worried about the cost and intensity of the procedure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my blood work came back normal, I wondered whether I was overreacting. Did I really need a colonoscopy?&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For one, it was expensive. The procedure would cost $2,000 total without insurance. My GI explained that because my test was diagnostic and being done to examine colon cancer symptoms (as opposed to a standard colon cancer screening), it applied to my deductible. She also said the cost could vary based on my insurance plan, how far into the deductible I was, and where the colonoscopy was being done. Because I did mine at a free-standing endoscopy center instead of a hospital, it cut down on costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimate I got from my insurance company was about $813. That didn't include other potential fees such as biopsies. This is still lower than the national &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/colon-cancer/colonoscopy-cost" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;average cost for a colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $1,250, and some of my coworkers under 45 were quoted closer to $2,000.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      The estimate I got prior to the procedure. I was also told that laboratory fees, such as biopsies, could cost extra.

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The idea of the procedure itself felt intense, too. I'd need to fast and take about $40 of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/laxatives-shortage-constipation-hybrid-work-fiber-2023-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;laxatives&lt;/a&gt; and Gatorade the night before, undergo &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/anesthesia-side-effects" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;anesthesia&lt;/a&gt;, and have my husband pick me up. There were also very rare risks, such as tears to my colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few times a week, I'd approach my husband forlornly, asking him whether he thought I was overreacting and should skip the procedure. Sadly, I learned the hard truth: No one could make this decision but me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postponing would be complicated, given our future plans to have kids: I can't get a colonoscopy &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bloody-stool-pregnancy-hemorrhoids-colorectal-cancer-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;once I'm pregnant&lt;/a&gt; because of risks to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realized I was fortunate: I had time to pre-plan and budget my colonoscopy, I could easily take a sick day from work, and my husband could take a few hours off from his job to pick me up. If I was going to do it, now was absolutely the best time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8916fde1-0162-47ce-9641-705a1ed9cb73" data-toc-id="8916fde1-0162-47ce-9641-705a1ed9cb73"&gt;I'm glad I did it, but insurance is a pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the bad news: Months after the procedure, I'm still dealing with insurance costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made sure that my &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/how-to-use-fsa-money" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;FSA funds&lt;/a&gt;, the pre-tax money I elected to set aside for medical costs, would cover at least most of the procedure and any extra fees. But because my receipt was missing information, the reimbursement for $813 was denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked for a complete receipt, I was told I'd need to wait 30 to 60 days for my insurance to process my itemized statement. While I was waiting, I was mailed two more bills: $124.08 for a physician's processing fee and $125.40 for the anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      I assumed these costs were already covered in the colonoscopy fee, which was more than $800.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Julia Pugachevsky
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I'm holding on to them until I get reimbursed for the $813. Otherwise, I'd be paying more than $1,000 out of pocket, with no clarity on when I'll actually get the money back, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="db87b3ed-d00c-454c-85d7-b1522b5c270f" data-toc-id="db87b3ed-d00c-454c-85d7-b1522b5c270f"&gt;I finally had answers for my symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: The colonoscopy itself went smoothly. Sure, induced bowel cleansing wasn't my idea of a riveting Wednesday night. But from speaking to people who've had colonoscopies, it sounds like it wasn't as unpleasant as chugging &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3566661/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;Golytely&lt;/a&gt;, a common colonoscopy prep medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual procedure took about 20 minutes, all of which I was out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, my GI popped in to explain my results. It was a huge relief to have answers. Like she suspected, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-young-people-misdiagnosed-hemorrhoids-women-worldclass-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;internal hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt;, swollen veins in the anus and lower rectum, were causing the bleeding. Hemorrhoids are fairly common in young people, and activities such as lifting heavy weights can cause them. Looking back, the bleeding began around when I started &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/realized-protein-intake-was-low-when-began-weightlifting-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, and my GI confirmed that it could exacerbate the hemorrhoids. I can manage them by drinking more water, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-fiber-high-protein-food-plant-based-sources-nutritionist-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;eating more fiber&lt;/a&gt;, and using hydrocortisone cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also found and removed two polyps, one of which could have been precancerous because of its size. A few weeks later, a biopsy confirmed that the polyp was benign, and I don't have to get another colonoscopy until I'm 45 — the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/when-to-get-first-colonoscopy-2021-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;recommended starting age&lt;/a&gt; for colon cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the rate of colorectal cancer rises among young people, there is a push for people to get their&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer symptoms&lt;/a&gt; checked out.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But I can understand why anyone under the recommended screening age would skip a colonoscopy. Beyond the financial obstacle, it's not a quick procedure, and it requires a support system. It's easy to feel like spending time and money on what could be a benign result isn't worth the peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;so many early signs of colon cancer are mild. Stories from &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-31-diagnosed-colon-cancer-despite-being-fit-and-healthy-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; — the ones who only got diagnosed in late stages and had to navigate much more invasive treatments with lower chances of success — ultimately taught me that it's never worth taking a chance. It's a steep price to pay, but I'm glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 2, 2025: This story was updated with information about the Cologuard stool test. It's usually recommended to people over 45 who have no symptoms and are considered at average risk for colon cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Known officially as XFG—or informally as “Stratus”—it has been &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=260a9981_4&amp;amp;download=true"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; a “variant under monitoring” by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is expected to circulate alongside the now dominant &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/who-monitors-new-covid-variant-nb181-spread-america-europe-nimbus/"&gt;Nimbus variant&lt;/a&gt; throughout the northern hemisphere summer. The risk to public health is low, the WHO has said. Infections are characterized by a particular symptom: hoarseness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Stratus is a combination of the LF.7 and LP.8.1.2 lineages of the virus, and when comparing Stratus to the previously dominant JN1 variant, “distinct mutational profiles in the spike protein can be identified,” the WHO has said. “Spike mutations at amino acids 478 and 487 enhance antibody avoidance”—meaning, in other words, the variant may be more adept at evading our immune defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Stratus has been dominant in India throughout the spring, and has now started to spread at large across the world. Gisaid, a global initiative that tracks the spread of viral variants, reported that 22.7 percent of Covid samples submitted to it during the last week of May were Stratus, up from 7.4 percent four weeks earlier. These samples came from 38 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Available data doesn’t suggest that the variant causes more severe disease or deaths than others in circulation, though doctors in India have noted that &lt;a data-offer-url="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/covid-19-resurges-how-this-new-symptom-is-key-to-xfg-nb-1-8-1-and-lf-7-variants/articleshow/121510457.cms" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/covid-19-resurges-how-this-new-symptom-is-key-to-xfg-nb-1-8-1-and-lf-7-variants/articleshow/121510457.cms"}' href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/covid-19-resurges-how-this-new-symptom-is-key-to-xfg-nb-1-8-1-and-lf-7-variants/articleshow/121510457.cms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hoarseness&lt;/a&gt; is a common symptom.

You’re not alone, and this isn’t just about looking great in mirror selfies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat, the deep-seated belly fat wrapped around your organs, significantly raises the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, inflammation, and more. So when experts recommend a top-tier “green” you should eat daily to target visceral fat quickly, it's worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loaded with carotenoids, fiber, and fat-fighting plant compounds, this ‘evergreen hero’ helps ignite fat oxidation, suppress appetite, and reduce inflammation. Backed by clinical trials, nutritional science, and real-world success stories, this green can not only help you shave inches off your waistline but also bolster your long-term health. And mind you – this green isn’t just a trend, it’s a visceral-fat-busting essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious to know which green veggie has such superpowers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The #1 daily green for slashing visceral fat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve guessed it, it’s spinach!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, dietitians rank spinach as the top green veggie for visceral fat reduction. According to dietitian consensus, spinach stands out as the ultimate choice for reducing visceral fat. An EatingWell analysis highlights spinach’s rich carotenoid content – especially lutein and zeaxanthin – linked to enhanced fat oxidation and lowered inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of cooked spinach provides about 4 g of fiber (~14 % DV), promoting satiety and improved cholesterol, critical for trimming deep belly fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which approach do you think works better for reducing belly fat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mechanisms of visceral fat reduction:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Carotenoids fuel fat oxidation and cut inflammation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spinach delivers abundant lutein and zeaxanthin – carotenoids that activate fat-burning pathways while damping inflammation. Randomized trials demonstrate that boosting blood carotenoid levels correlates with reduced visceral fat and waist size. For instance, in a double‑blind study among obese Japanese men, high-lutein drinkers experienced significant visceral fat loss, underscoring the fat-lowering role of these phytochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Appetite control via green thylakoids:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spinach’s thylakoids – chlorophyll-rich plant membranes – have been shown to curb cravings and boost satiety hormones (like CCK), while reducing hunger cues like ghrelin. In a Swedish trial, women who consumed thylakoid-rich beverages lost an average of 11 lb in 12 weeks, with lowered LDL even before weight loss began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High fiber leads to lasting fullness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; One cup of cooked spinach provides roughly 4 g of fiber – about 14% of daily needs. Its fiber slows digestion, curbs hunger, keeps cholesterol in check, and helps regulate glucose – key factors in minimizing visceral fat – making it easier to sustain a calorie-friendly diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why spinach is the ‘superior’ superhero&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While broccoli and other cruciferous veggies offer sulforaphane, fiber, and metabolic benefits, spinach’s unique blend of carotenoids and thylakoids gives it an edge against visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02525-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;DIRECT‑PLUS trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared a traditional Mediterranean diet against a "green" version enriched in polyphenols (from green tea, duckweed, and walnuts) and low in red meat. The green-MED group saw visceral fat drop by 14% over 18 months – twice the reduction of standard MED (7%) and triple that of healthy guidelines alone (4.5%) – even with similar total weight loss. This supports spinach’s role: it's a polyphenol- and carotenoid-rich staple that complements weight-loss effects by amplifying visceral fat decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond weight loss, spinach enhances insulin sensitivity, reduces liver fat, and supports cardio-metabolic health – benefits observed even in youth consuming non-starchy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to incorporate spinach into an everyday diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Smoothies and green shakes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blend 1–2 handfuls with fruits and protein powder.

It’s scientifically proven to reduce deep belly fat, support satiety, and fight inflammation. However, spinach alone won’t do as much wonder as it would – when combined with regular workout and a disciplined diet plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blend it into smoothies, toss it in salads or omelets – but make sure to pair it with a healthy lifestyle.

What's more, vitamin C concentrations normally delivered to human skin via the bloodstream are sufficient to have a measurable effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research from Japan, first-authored by pharmaceutical scientist Yasunori Sato of Hokuriku University, points to vitamin C as a tool for staving off at least some of the impacts of aging on our &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470464/"&gt;largest organ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vitamin C seems to influence the structure and function of epidermis, especially by controlling the growth of epidermal cells," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016632/index.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; biologist Akihito Ishigami of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We investigated whether it promotes cell proliferation and differentiation via  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="165903" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/9-foods-that-pack-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;9 Foods That Pack More Vitamin C Than an Orange&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy human skin contains high levels of vitamin C, suggesting active accumulation, and concentrations are lower in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01469.x"&gt;aged or UV-damaged skin&lt;/a&gt;. We know that the vitamin &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9080866"&gt;plays an important role&lt;/a&gt; in skin health, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.110"&gt;boosting collagen&lt;/a&gt; production, alleviating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34530-4"&gt;UV damage&lt;/a&gt;, and providing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2010.03.003"&gt;antioxidant protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know that vitamin C &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.493"&gt;plays a role&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;demethylation of DNA&lt;/a&gt;, a process of removing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"&gt;methyl groups&lt;/a&gt; that is important for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.675780"&gt;genetic stability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-016-2145-x"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition or removal of methyl groups act like a kind of molecular switch that can turn gene activity on or off, without changing the genomic sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What role demethylation plays in the differentiation of skin cells called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"&gt;keratinocytes&lt;/a&gt;, however, was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_137472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137472" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642.jpg" alt="Diagram showing structure of our genetic molecules from chromosome to DNA including methylation" class="size-full wp-image-137472" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642-593x415.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-137472" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;When epigenetic factors, which can come from other genes or the environment inside a cell or beyond, recruit a methyl group, it changes the expression of our genes. (ttsz/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis"&gt; epidermis&lt;/a&gt; is dominated by keratinocytes, which form at the very bottommost layer and slowly move upward through its multiple layers as they mature, eventually becoming the dead cells that make up the skin's uppermost layer – the&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_corneum"&gt; stratum corneum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stratum corneum consists entirely of dead cells, serving a protective function for the live skin cells underneath. It's from here that dead skin cells are shed, replenished by keratinocytes making their way up from below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the role of vitamin C in skin health, the researchers grew human keratinocytes in petri dishes, with the upper layer exposed to the air, and fed by a nutrient solution from below, mimicking how skin behaves in living humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into the nutrient solution, the researchers added concentrations of vitamin C consistent with the concentrations delivered by the circulatory system. A separate group of cells was grown without vitamin C as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one week, the models nourished with vitamin C had a thicker layer of living epidermis cells than the control group, while no effect was seen on the stratum corneum. After 14 days, the epidermal cell layer was thicker still, and the stratum corneum showed thinning, suggesting that the vitamin C was promoting cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/grapefruit-juice-can-kill-you-evidence-shows?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Grapefruit Juice Can Kill You, Evidence Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sequenced the DNA and RNA of their samples, and traced this cell proliferation to demethylation that appears to be mediated by vitamin C sustaining the function of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TET_enzymes"&gt;enzymes that regulate gene activity through demethylation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These enzymes need a specific form of iron to keep doing their demethylation job, and vitamin C helps regenerate that form of iron. This effectively reactivates the genes associated with cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the influence of vitamin C, the expression of 12 key proliferation genes in the samples was increased, some by as much as 75 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers applied an inhibitor to the enzyme, the effect was reversed, confirming that vitamin C works through this specific pathway. These results suggest the vitamin may be useful to develop treatments for countering the effects of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that vitamin C helps thicken the skin by encouraging keratinocyte proliferation through DNA demethylation," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016632/index.html"&gt;Ishigami says&lt;/a&gt;, "making it a promising treatment for thinning skin, especially in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2025.03.040"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core strength plays such a vital role in everyday movement such as sitting, standing and walking, that it’s little wonder it’s one of the most popular topics with &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well &lt;/em&gt;readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people naturally assume that you should train your core with well-known exercises such as crunches, sit-ups and planks, and while those are all effective approaches, yoga offers something different for your &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-is-the-core-muscle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-is-the-core-muscle"&gt;core muscles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike conventional abdominal workouts that often target only superficial muscles, yoga activates the deep stabilising muscles, including the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Transversus_Abdominis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Transversus_Abdominis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;transverse abdominis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Lumbar_Multifidus" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Lumbar_Multifidus" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;multifidus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Pelvic_Floor_Anatomy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Pelvic_Floor_Anatomy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;pelvic floor&lt;/a&gt;,” says yoga instructor Annelise Piers from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://myyogateacher.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://myyogateacher.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;My Yoga Teacher&lt;/a&gt;, “creating what I call 360° core stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The breath-synchronised movement patterns in yoga teach the nervous system how to maintain core engagement during functional activities, which translates directly to improved posture, reduced back pain and enhanced athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often tell my students that yoga doesn't just build core strength, it builds intelligent core function that serves you in every movement, both on and off the mat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked Piers to share her favorite poses to build core strength, particularly for beginner yogis, or those who don’t regularly practice.

your head, while extending and lowering your left leg.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stop when your arm and leg are just off the floor, or if you feel your lower back arch away from the floor, and return to

			&lt;p&gt;Waking up from a nightmare can leave your heart pounding, but the effects may reach far beyond a restless night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who suffer bad dreams every week were almost &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;three times&lt;/a&gt; more likely to die before age 75 than people who rarely have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;alarming&lt;/a&gt; conclusion – which is yet to be peer reviewed – comes from researchers who combined data from four large long-term studies in the US, following more than 4,000 people between the ages of 26 and 74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, participants reported how often nightmares disrupted their sleep. Over the next 18 years, the researchers kept track of how many participants died prematurely – 227 in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Dangers of Sleep Deprivation Are Very Real, Expert Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after considering common risk factors like age, sex, mental health, smoking and weight, people who had nightmares every week were still found to be nearly three times more likely to die prematurely – about the same risk as heavy smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined "epigenetic clocks" – chemical marks on DNA that act as biological mileage counters. People haunted by frequent nightmares were biologically older than their birth certificates suggested, across all three clocks used (DunedinPACE, GrimAge and PhenoAge).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind the silent scream&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster ageing accounted for about 39% of the link between nightmares and early death, implying that whatever is driving the bad dreams is simultaneously driving the body's cells &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;towards the finish line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might a scream you never utter leave a mark on your genome? Nightmares happen during so-called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MbLSnGOCDk"&gt;rapid-eye-movement sleep&lt;/a&gt; when the brain is highly active but muscles are paralysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden surge of adrenaline, cortisol and other fight-or-flight chemicals can be as strong as anything experienced while awake. If that alarm bell rings night after night, the stress response may stay partially switched on throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Continuous stress takes its toll on the body. It triggers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3253267/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and speeds up the ageing process by wearing down the protective tips of our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5590630/"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166466" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166466" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642.jpg" alt="chromosomes" class="wp-image-166466 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166466" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Continuous stress can wear down the protective tips of chromosomes. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, being jolted awake by nightmares disrupts deep sleep, the crucial time when the body &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3256323/"&gt;repairs itself&lt;/a&gt; and clears &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38639025/"&gt;out waste&lt;/a&gt; at the cellular level. Together, these two effects – constant stress and poor sleep – may be the main reasons the body seems to age faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that disturbing dreams foreshadow poor health is not entirely new. Earlier studies have shown that adults tormented by weekly nightmares are more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nightmares-are-a-good-predictor-of-future-dementia-new-study-191016"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/parkinsons-disease-bad-dreams-could-be-an-early-warning-sign-new-study-184495"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;years before&lt;/a&gt; any daytime symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence suggests that the brain areas involved in dreaming are also those affected by brain diseases, so frequent nightmares might be an early warning sign of neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nightmares are also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;surprisingly common&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly 5% of adults report at least one each week and another 12.5% experience them monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166464" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166464" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642.jpg" alt="person waking from nightmare" class="wp-image-166464 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166464" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Around 5% of adults have nightmares at least once a week. (PhotoVic/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they are both frequent and treatable, the new findings elevate bad dreams from a spooky nuisance to a potential public health target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioural therapy for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3900619/"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4120639/"&gt;imagery-rehearsal therapy&lt;/a&gt; – where sufferers rewrite the ending of a recurrent nightmare while awake – and simple steps such as keeping bedrooms cool, dark and screen free have all been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5991964/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; to curb nightmare frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before jumping to conclusions, there are a few important things to keep in mind. The study used people's own reports of their dreams, which can make it hard to tell the difference between a typical bad dream and a true nightmare. Also, most of the people in the study were white Americans, so the findings might not apply to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And biological age was measured only once, so we cannot yet say whether treating nightmares slows the clock. Crucially, the work was presented as a &lt;a href="https://www.ean.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ean/Congress-2025/EAN2025_Congress_Abstract_Book.pdf"&gt;conference abstract&lt;/a&gt; and has not yet navigated the gauntlet of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/science-peer-review" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73086" data-postid="166461" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study has important strengths that make it worth taking seriously. The researchers used multiple groups of participants, followed them for many years and relied on official death records rather than self-reported data. This means we can't simply dismiss the findings as a statistical fluke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If other research teams can replicate these results, doctors might start asking patients about their nightmares during routine check-ups – alongside taking blood pressure and checking cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies that tame frightening dreams are inexpensive, non-invasive and already available. Scaling them could offer a rare chance to add years to life while improving the quality of the hours we spend asleep.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260008/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Struggle with math? A gentle jolt to the brain might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published Tuesday in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003200&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that mild electrical stimulation can boost arithmetic performance – and offers fresh insight into the brain mechanisms behind mathematical ability, along with a potential way to optimize learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could eventually help narrow cognitive gaps and help build a more intellectually equitable society, the authors argue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Different people have different brains, and their brains control a lot in their life," said Roi Cohen Kadosh, a neuroscientist at the University of Surrey &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/could-electric-brain-stimulation-lead-to-better-maths-skills-260134"&gt;who led the research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think about the environment – if you go to the right school, if you have the right teacher – but it's also our biology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen Kadosh and colleagues recruited 72 University of Oxford students, scanning their brains to measure connectivity between three key regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chewing-wood-could-give-your-brain-an-unexpected-boost?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Chewing Wood Could Give Your Brain an Unexpected Boost&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants then tackled math problems that required either calculating answers or recalling memorized solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166458" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/doing_maths_642.jpg" alt="maths written on note pad" class="wp-image-166458 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/doing_maths_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/doing_maths_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/doing_maths_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166458" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Participants calculated mathematical problems while having their brains scanned. (pixelshot/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that stronger connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which governs executive function, and the posterior parietal cortex, involved in memory, predicted better calculation performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers applied a painless form of brain stimulation using electrode-fitted caps – a technique known as transcranial random noise stimulation – the low performers saw their scores jump by 25–29 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team believes the stimulation works by enhancing the excitability of neurons and interacting with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22857-gamma-aminobutyric-acid-gaba"&gt;GABA&lt;/a&gt;, a brain chemical that inhibits excessive activity – effectively compensating for weak neural connectivity in some participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the stimulation helped underperformers reach or even surpass the scores of peers with naturally stronger brain wiring. But those who already performed well saw no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some people struggle with things, and if we can help their brain to fulfill their potential, we open them a lot of opportunities that otherwise would be closed," said Cohen Kadosh, calling it an "exciting time" for the field of brain stimulation research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he flagged a key ethical concern: the risk that such technologies could become more available to those with financial means, widening – rather than closing – access gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also urged the public not to try this at home. "Some people struggle with learning, and if our research proves successful beyond the lab, we could help them fulfil their ambitions and unlock opportunities that might otherwise remain out of reach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that sleep quality is important for many different aspects of our health, and there are multiple ways to get better shut-eye – including the right &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experiment-reveals-a-simple-way-to-boost-your-sleep-quality"&gt;bedroom environment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/want-better-sleep-this-one-piece-of-advice-seems-to-work-for-almost-everybody"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt;, and according to the latest research, lots of fruit and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by a team from the University of Chicago and Columbia University in New York, and connects fruit and vegetable intake during the day with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-ways-to-get-a-better-night-s-sleep-according-to-science"&gt;the quality of sleep&lt;/a&gt; that same night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As sleep &lt;span&gt;aids&lt;/span&gt; go, putting a bit more fruit and veg on your plate is a pretty good option: it's cheap, it's natural, and you don't need a prescription. And then of course you get &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fruits-and-vegetables-have-a-surprising-effect-on-depression-risk"&gt;all the other benefits&lt;/a&gt; of these foodstuffs too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cognitive-shuffling-really-could-help-insomniacs-get-to-sleep?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Cognitive Shuffling Really Could Help Insomniacs Get to Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The temporal associations and objectively-measured outcomes in this study represent crucial steps toward filling a gap in important public health knowledge," &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/eating-fruits-and-veggies-may-improve-sleep"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Esra Tasali, sleep scientist at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research involved 34 healthy young adults, who were asked to record their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;eating habits&lt;/a&gt; for up to a week. Wearable devices were then used to check for sleep fragmentation: essentially, how often people wake up or switch between sleep phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165123" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SleepChart.jpg" alt="Diet and sleep chart" class="wp-image-165123 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SleepChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SleepChart-596x415.jpg 596w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/SleepChart-600x418.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165123" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Eating more fruit and vegetables was linked to a lower sleep fragmentation index (SFI) . (Boege et al., &lt;em&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who ate more fruit and veg tended to have a smoother night of sleep, the researchers found. The same was true for those who ate more healthy carbohydrates, such as whole grains – and the researchers think it's the carbohydrates and fiber in the fruit and veggies that are having the strongest effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via a statistical modeling approach, the researchers suggest that eating the recommended five cups of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/keep-your-fruit-and-veg-fresher-for-longer-with-these-science-backed-hacks"&gt;fruit and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; per day could improve sleep quality by 16 percent. One cup would be the equivalent of 8 large strawberries, a medium potato, or 22 grapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165125" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProduceChart.jpg" alt="Produce chart" class="wp-image-165125 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProduceChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProduceChart-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ProduceChart-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165125" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers helpfully provided some fruit and vegetable measurements. (University of Chicago)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"16 percent is a highly significant difference," &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/eating-fruits-and-veggies-may-improve-sleep"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tasali. "It's remarkable that such a meaningful change could be observed within less than 24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the data from this research isn't enough on its own to show direct cause and effect – other factors, such as income, could have been influencing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-a-surprising-link-between-food-and-sleep-heres-how-to-eat-for-a-restful-night"&gt;both diet and sleep&lt;/a&gt; – the study team did find a significant relationship here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also fits in with what is previously known about a good diet being &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/high-protein-and-fiber-diet-linked-to-longer-better-sleep-study-finds"&gt;linked to good sleep&lt;/a&gt;. It's an association that makes sense, with our health closely tied to both how much rest we're getting, and what we're putting into our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also likely to be something of a feedback loop going on here as well – which further studies could look into more closely – because research suggests that poor sleep then makes us more likely to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-night-of-poor-sleep-can-change-how-your-brain-sees-food"&gt;crave unhealthy foods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we can say for sure about sleep is that a lot of factors contribute to its quality, whether that's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intense-cold-exposure-might-actually-help-you-sleep-better-study-shows"&gt;body temperature&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-15-extra-minutes-of-sleep-is-linked-to-brain-benefits-in-young-people"&gt;the timing of our slumbers&lt;/a&gt;. It's also something that a lot of us &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/642704/americans-sleeping-less-stressed.aspx"&gt;struggle with&lt;/a&gt;, so different approaches to improving sleep are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are always asking me if there are things they can eat that will help them sleep better," &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/research-and-discoveries-articles/eating-fruits-and-veggies-may-improve-sleep"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Marie-Pierre St-Onge, nutritionist at Columbia University. "Small changes can impact sleep. That is empowering – better rest is within your control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2025.05.003"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="316" data-end="456"&gt;When I first went vegan, I assumed I had it down. Quinoa? Check. Kale? Check. Vegan cheese, tofu dogs, almond milk everything? Double check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="458" data-end="625"&gt;But here's the thing: I still felt off. I was bloated half the time, weirdly tired after lunch, and constantly snacking even though I was technically eating “healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="627" data-end="935"&gt;So I did what any curious label-reader with a Wi-Fi connection would do: I started digging. Through studies, nutrition forums, and registered dietitian breakdowns. What I found surprised me—not just because I was misinformed, but because I’d &lt;em data-start="869" data-end="900"&gt;been spreading the same myths&lt;/em&gt; to friends thinking I was helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="937" data-end="1054"&gt;Here are six vegan food myths I believed, why they don’t hold up, and what I learned from finally doing the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1061" data-end="1102"&gt;1. “If it’s vegan, it must be healthy”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1104" data-end="1308"&gt;This one’s tempting. The label says “plant-based,” so you assume it’s good for you. I used to load up my cart with vegan granola bars, coconut yogurt, and cashew-based desserts thinking I was crushing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1310" data-end="1376"&gt;But as it turns out, "vegan" and "nutrient-dense" aren't synonyms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1378" data-end="1658"&gt;A 2022 analysis in &lt;em data-start="1397" data-end="1421"&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found that many &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.900598/full?.com"&gt;ultra-processed vegan foods&lt;/a&gt; are just as high in sodium, saturated fat, and added sugars as their animal-based counterparts. Some were even &lt;em data-start="1577" data-end="1584"&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; in protein and fiber—which are key to staying full and energized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1660" data-end="1877"&gt;Now, instead of relying on the “vegan” label, I ask: is this food close to its original form? If it grew from the ground and doesn’t need a long ingredients list to explain itself, it’s more likely to nourish my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1884" data-end="1947"&gt;2. “Vegan meat substitutes are always better than real meat”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1949" data-end="2077"&gt;I used to think that swapping burgers for Beyond Burgers was a clear health win. No cholesterol! No cruelty! No question, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2079" data-end="2096"&gt;Well… yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2098" data-end="2344"&gt;While plant-based meat alternatives can reduce your intake of saturated fat and help lower carbon emissions (a 2020 study in &lt;em data-start="2223" data-end="2231"&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; found that plant-based diets can &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_diet?.com"&gt;cut food-related greenhouse gases&lt;/a&gt; by up to 73%), they’re not all created equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2346" data-end="2675"&gt;Many vegan meats are still highly processed and contain additives, gums, and flavor enhancers to mimic meat. And research from &lt;em data-start="2473" data-end="2517"&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; shows that some people experience bloating or &lt;a href="https://proveg.org/article/how-to-alleviate-consumer-misconceptions-about-pea-protein/?.com"&gt;gastrointestinal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; from soy isolates or pea protein concentrates often used in these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2677" data-end="2785"&gt;Now, I use meat substitutes more like “treat” foods—great for cookouts or cravings, but not my daily staple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2792" data-end="2841"&gt;3. “Almond milk is the best dairy alternative”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2843" data-end="3003"&gt;Almond milk was my go-to for years. It tasted light, blended well in smoothies, and had that café-approved vibe. But nutritionally? Not as magical as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3005" data-end="3304"&gt;Unless fortified, almond milk is often low in protein and calcium. A 2021 review in &lt;em data-start="3089" data-end="3100"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; found that many commercial plant milks have inconsistent nutrient profiles—and almond milk ranked among the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224423003837?.com"&gt;lowest for protein content&lt;/a&gt; per serving (often just 1 gram compared to soy’s 7–8 grams).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3306" data-end="3403"&gt;What’s more, almonds are water-intensive to grow—so it’s not the most eco-friendly option either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3405" data-end="3600"&gt;These days, I alternate between soy milk (for protein), oat milk (for creaminess), and fortified hemp milk (for omega-3s). No single option is perfect, but I try to match the milk to the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3607" data-end="3642"&gt;4. “More fiber is always better”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3644" data-end="3788"&gt;When I first went vegan, I loaded up on fiber-rich foods: lentils, whole grains, cruciferous veggies, flaxseeds. I figured the more, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3790" data-end="3826"&gt;But my gut said otherwise—literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3828" data-end="4223"&gt;Fiber is great for digestion, yes. But when you go from low-to-high fiber overnight (as many do when switching to a plant-based diet), your body can freak out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3828" data-end="4223"&gt;A 2020 study in &lt;em data-start="4010" data-end="4052"&gt;The American Journal of Gastroenterology&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that sudden fiber increases can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7056053/?.com"&gt;cause gas, bloating, and discomfort&lt;/a&gt;—especially when water intake is low or gut bacteria aren’t used to breaking it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4225" data-end="4380"&gt;I learned to pace myself. I now introduce new fiber sources gradually and drink plenty of water to help things move along. My gut feels way more chill now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4387" data-end="4442"&gt;5. “Vegan means I don't have to worry about protein”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4444" data-end="4649"&gt;Yep, I believed this one hard. I was eating beans, peanut butter, and oats—so I figured I had enough protein. But I was often fatigued, took longer to recover from workouts, and started losing muscle tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4651" data-end="5005"&gt;It turns out, not all plant proteins are equal in terms of amino acid profile and bioavailability. According to a report, older adults (and anyone active) need &lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/protein-requirements-by-age?.com"&gt;more protein per kilogram of body weight&lt;/a&gt; than previously thought—and that need can be hard to meet on carbs and nut butter alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5007" data-end="5266"&gt;Once I started tracking (even loosely), I realized I was only getting about 40–50 grams a day. Now I aim for 70–80, and include higher-quality plant proteins like tempeh, seitan, tofu, and legumes combined with grains. Game-changer for my energy and strength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5273" data-end="5341"&gt;6. “If you eat a balanced vegan diet, you don’t need supplements”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5343" data-end="5510"&gt;For a while, I wore my no-supplement stance like a badge of honor. “I get everything from food!” I’d say. And sure, it sounded impressive—but it wasn’t entirely smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5512" data-end="5678"&gt;The truth is, even well-planned vegan diets can fall short on certain nutrients—namely vitamin B12, vitamin D, omega-3s (EPA/DHA), iodine, and sometimes iron or zinc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5680" data-end="5866"&gt;A 2020 review published in &lt;em data-start="5707" data-end="5718"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; emphasized that while whole plant foods are nutrient-rich, a few essentials are &lt;a href="https://www.saintlukeskc.org/about/news/research-shows-vegan-diet-leads-nutritional-deficiencies-health-problems-plant-forward?.com"&gt;hard to come by without animal products&lt;/a&gt; or fortified foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5868" data-end="6069"&gt;Now I take a B12 supplement, plus an algae-based omega-3. In winter months, I add D3. It's not a sign of failure—it’s smart planning. You wouldn’t drive cross-country without checking your fuel, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6076" data-end="6142"&gt;It’s not about perfect—it’s about paying attention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6144" data-end="6357"&gt;If there’s one thing I’ve learned from busting these myths, it’s that “plant-based” isn’t a finish line. It’s a mindset—one that asks you to stay curious, check your assumptions, and care enough to course-correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6359" data-end="6504"&gt;I still love being vegan. But now, I love it &lt;em data-start="6404" data-end="6409"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; feel good doing it. No more falling asleep at 3pm or wondering why I’m cranky after breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6506" data-end="6684"&gt;So if you’ve been wondering why your plant-based journey feels off—even when you’re “doing it right”—start with your plate. Not to fix it perfectly. Just to understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6686" data-end="6769"&gt;Because when your food works &lt;em data-start="6715" data-end="6721"&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; you, everything else gets just a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;

Utah State Epidemiologist Leisha Nolen said last week that she anticipates more cases in Utah that are yet to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 1,227 measles cases this year, 95% of which were in unvaccinated people or people whose vaccination status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said with 90% of Utahns protected by a vaccine, there is "not a need for significant concern" around measles in Utah. Those who have been vaccinated, she said, will experience a milder infection, recover faster and not transmit the disease to others around them. She encouraged Utahns who are not vaccinated to discuss that decision with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the U.S., 12% of cases have required hospitalization, whereas in Utah, at least two of the nine cases have required hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the United States cases, over 700 were located in Texas and 89% of cases are connected to 23 separate outbreaks, according to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;update last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that new cases have been decreasing; however, its latest updates from June don't reflect the recent cases in Utah. It updates its page with new cases each Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early stages of measles symptoms — high fever, cough, runny nose or red eyes — usually appear seven to 14 days after exposure. A rash on the hairline typically appears after four days of fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has been exposed to measles or is showing symptoms should call a health care provider first before visiting a clinic to prevent spreading the disease to others, Utah's health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 22:47:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNZlJ3SHFOZFJWY0d0eWlGaVZUa1FXS3JEVl91UEdGd1gyQW5Jd1ZDVThlc1VyV0VualplQkxZU0J2NkRYanBzS2syY1RILVdHcGppeEY2V3BQR1AzOUkzNGZIT0tVaUtrR2pXVjNsSlNndzhmVE9XOU91ZVgzLV9TeWhOeEprb3Rua0pfcERzSXZGbFJlZEthRA</guid></item><item><title>65岁以上仍有患HPV癌症风险的女性，应接受宫颈癌筛查–研究–《卫报》 | Women over 65 still at risk from cancer from HPV and should be offered cervical screening – study - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSzdDXzRCVEtPRmhUTDM5ZXk1T0ZEclh0cVM2U3BZRnR0YmRpcmNYQW5pNHFqUjNDeGNTc0t5bE5KbmxnZFFuSklTbFlrN3JaeU1rc3IxdkRfR0dlSVFPUkliY2pDU2pSck9CRlE2TGdPVUNqQWZndzN1ZXhWdjQ3cHBMNjBtZDNaQ1I0WFlyMXVUUEdwcDlQY2g5VG1hNkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Routine &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cervical-cancer" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cervical screening&lt;/a&gt;

suggests this would prevent 62m deaths and a cumulative 74m new cases of cervical cancer by 2120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Screening programmes vary from country to country, but most guidelines recommend stopping cervical screening after the age of 65 if previous test results have been normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Yet global cases of cervical cancer among people over 65 have been rising: in 2022, worldwide there were 157,182 new cases and 124,269 deaths from the disease among women aged 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the UK, while screening and vaccination rates are higher than many other countries, &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/cervical-cancer-elimination-by-2040-plan-for-england/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;they have been falling&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. Cervical cancer leads to approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/statistics-by-cancer-type/cervical-cancer/mortality#heading-Zero" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;685 deaths a year in England&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now a large-scale observational study published in Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinical Medicine has found that older women are more likely to have HPV infections and to have abnormal cells in test results than younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers in China analysed cervical cancer screening data for more than 2 million women between 2017 and 2023. Of the 2 million, 17,420 were aged 65 and above; the remainder were younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found greater prevalence of high-risk HPV infections and abnormal cells among women aged 65 and over than in younger women. Nearly 14% of those 65 and over tested positive for high-risk HPV infection types, compared with 8% of those who were younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Older women were also more likely to be infected with several different types of HPV and have abnormalities picked up on screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While acknowledging limitations to the study, the findings indicate that “women [aged 65 and above] are a high-risk group for cervical cancer incidence and mortality, necessitating urgent attention from countries worldwide”, the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Most guidelines suggest stopping screening for those with adequate primary screening and no high-risk factors, particularly for women under 65,” they say. “However, the situation differs for those over 65, who may not have been vaccinated or thoroughly screened. With increasing life expectancy, the risk of cervical cancer in this demographic is significantly heightened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Athena Lamnisos, chief executive of the Eve Appeal cancer charity, said among people over 65, “there is a largely unvaccinated population who, if under-screened or if they have never attended screening, may well still be at high risk of cervical cancer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We would look to the National Screening Committee to examine the findings and see if there would be benefits in reviewing screening age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maxine Lenza, health information manager at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, said: “Recent improvements to the test in the UK means it’s an extremely effective way of preventing cervical cancer and saving lives, so those over the age of 65 and up to date with their cervical screening will have a very low risk of developing the disease. However, women over 65 who have never had cervical screening can request a test with their GP practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An NHS spokesperson said: “The NHS cervical screening programme in England follows expert recommendations on age and frequency of screening by the UK National Screening Committee, which are based on regular reviews of the best evidence globally&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Women with an HPV-positive screening result at the age of 65 are invited for additional screening to monitor their ongoing risk and we would encourage all women to attend appointments when invited to ensure they have the best protection against cervical cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Social Care spokesperson said: “The screening age brackets are based on robust scientific evidence and an expert recommendation from the UK National Screening Committee, however any women who are worried about their symptoms can speak to their GP who will decide the best course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It is vital that we increase the number of women accepting their invitation for cervical cancer screening within the existing age bracket. As part of our 10-year health plan, those who are eligible will be offered convenient human papillomavirus self-sampling kits – breaking down barriers to healthcare as we shift from treatment to prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSzdDXzRCVEtPRmhUTDM5ZXk1T0ZEclh0cVM2U3BZRnR0YmRpcmNYQW5pNHFqUjNDeGNTc0t5bE5KbmxnZFFuSklTbFlrN3JaeU1rc3IxdkRfR0dlSVFPUkliY2pDU2pSck9CRlE2TGdPVUNqQWZndzN1ZXhWdjQ3cHBMNjBtZDNaQ1I0WFlyMXVUUEdwcDlQY2g5VG1hNkE</guid></item><item><title>研究人员表示，乳制品带来的甜蜜梦想- KSL新闻 | Sweet dreams soured by dairy, researchers say - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPSzI0Nm8wMkI5c0lDMnktbWlmTzJMQXJVT3FPZUVWSDBEZDFTbWR2bWQ0TU9YVkNreVMzXzZEYU0yV1B4aG5MZ2M0NWhfS3RLckMwWVJPR3Q5UDljbHNuRUVReEwxMTFnUGI0Yk5DNGlZbm1YT1RJbDBualZlanI4dW95Vm94alFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;TORONTO — A new Canadian study suggests that consuming dairy may increase the likelihood of nightmares and poor-quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1544475/full" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;published in Frontiers in Psychology Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, examined self-reported links between eating habits, gastrointestinal discomfort and dreaming in more than 1,000 students at MacEwan University in Edmonton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a third of respondents said they experienced regular nightmares. Among them, those with food sensitivities, and particularly lactose intolerance, were significantly more likely to report both disturbed sleep and emotionally intense or negative dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The severity of lactose intolerance symptoms was associated with the severity of nightmare disorders," said Dr. Tore Nielsen, lead author and director of the Dream and Nightmare Laboratory at Université de Montréal, in a video interview with CTVNews.ca. "So, the more severe the symptoms, the more severe the nightmare problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants filled out extensive questionnaires that asked about food sensitivities, sleep habits, dream recall, emotional tone of dreams and general health. Researchers also gathered data on eating patterns and diet quality, categorizing participants as having healthier or less healthy eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy eaters, defined as those who frequently consumed fast food, skipped meals or ate late in the evening, were more likely to experience negative dreams, even if they weren't classified as full nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unhealthy eating was, in fact, associated with more nightmares and with more negative dreams in general," Nielsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While only a small proportion of respondents said they believed food directly influenced their dreams, many of those who did blamed dairy, spicy foods or sweets. Nielsen noted that desserts were the most frequently cited culprits, followed by dairy, though the two categories may overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Desserts are often made with dairy," he said. "So, it's very likely that dairy is even part of that dessert group (blamed by the respondents)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported lactose intolerance stood out as the strongest dietary factor associated with nightmares, followed by food allergies more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study found "a significant association between food allergies and nightmares," Nielsen said the sample size for that group was too small to draw robust conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included questions about late-night and evening eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were quite interested in a phenomenon known as night eating," Nielsen said. "So, people get out of bed and go and get a snack out of the fridge and eat it and then go back to bed without any awareness of having done it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though only a small number of participants reported night eating behaviors, evening eating was common and contributed to the "unhealthy eating" classification used in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is evidence that eating certain foods before bed can affect your sleep," Nielsen said. "But the evidence for dreaming is not as strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautioned that self-reported data, particularly around what foods participants consumed and when, is inherently limited. While many people may suspect that what they eat affects their dreams, establishing a clear cause-and-effect relationship requires controlled experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only way we can really do that is with experimental studies where we have different groups eating different kinds of food before bed or not before bed, and then comparing the groups to see how their dreams change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyoming’s first reported measles case since 2010 may have exposed some people at the state’s largest hospital to the highly contagious virus, the Wyoming Department of Health said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health officials confirmed the measles case in an unvaccinated child who lives in Natrona County. It’s unclear how that child was exposed to the virus, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wyoming’s first case in 15 years comes amid increasing measles outbreaks nationally and in the Mountain West. All of Wyoming’s neighbors, save for Idaho and Nebraska, have reported cases in the past four weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/track-measles-outbreak-cases-us-map-rcna198932"&gt;according to a tally kept by NBC News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The infected Natrona County child visited the emergency department waiting room at Banner Wyoming Medical Center in Casper on two occasions last week: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on June 24.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;12:55 p.m. to 2:55 p.m. on June 25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in that waiting room during those times could have been exposed to measles, the health department reported. State health officials were working with the hospital to notify those individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are asking individuals who were potentially exposed to self-monitor for measles symptoms for 21 days past the exposure date, and consider avoiding crowded public places or high-risk settings such as daycare centers,” State Health Office Dr. Alexia Harrist said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s especially critical for people not vaccinated for the measles, mumps and rubella, commonly known as the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is notably contagious: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html"&gt;Nine out of 10 people near an infected person will become infected themselves&lt;/a&gt; without protection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

(Jim Goodson/CDC/Wikimedia Commons)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement to WyoFile, Banner Health confirmed that a patient with measles visited the Casper hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are working closely with state and county health departments to identify those who may have been exposed and take steps to minimize the risk of spread,” the statement read. “Over the past several months, the number of reported cases of measles has increased across the U.S. The health and safety of our team members, patients and visitors remain our highest priority. We will continue to partner with officials at all levels of government and local healthcare to protect and provide the very best care for the communities we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms, which can appear one or two weeks after exposure, include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The virus can cause serious health complications — especially in kids under 5 years old, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is highly effective, with two doses preventing measles 97% of the time, Harrist said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates, however, have been falling in the United States. The number of school-aged children vaccinated against measles fell from 95% to 92% between 2019 and 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/measles-is-making-a-comeback-can-we-stop-it-202503063091"&gt;according to Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;. Herd immunity for measles &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19"&gt;requires a 95% vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt;, the World Health Organization reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Wyoming, &lt;a href="https://wyofile.com/vaccine-exemptions-surge-in-wyoming/"&gt;vaccine exemptions have &lt;/a&gt;risen since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020. Meanwhile, the number of Wyoming kindergartners who received the MMR vaccine has ticked down from 97.5% during the 2012-13 school year to 93.5% in 2023-24, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/schoolvaxview/data-reports/index.html"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a vaccine skeptic who’s been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/measles-treatments-vaccines-kennedy.html"&gt;criticized for his response to the national outbreak&lt;/a&gt; and for his inconsistent stance on the measles vaccine in particular. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;

and 2015 helped researchers compare Parkinson’s patients with a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk was seen in people living one to three miles from a golf course and the expansive lawns that come with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Living within one mile of a fairway was linked to a 126% increase in odds of &lt;a aria-label="developing Parkinson's (opens in a new tab)"

found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in water service areas that included a golf course had nearly double the risk compared to areas without one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk jumped 82% for people living in under water service areas that also had vulnerable groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pesticides applied to golf courses may play a role in the incidence of PD [Parkinson’s disease] for nearby

													MEASURES. WE’RE GOING TO TURN TO FIVE ON YOUR HEALTH RIGHT NOW, AND MORE AMERICANS ARE FACING A NEW DANGER AFTER DARK. RESEARCHERS ARE NOW PREDICTING THAT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM SLEEP APNEA COULD DOUBLE BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS DOCTOR FAMILIAR FACE. WCVB CHANNEL 5. GOOD TO SEE YOU. TODD CHAIR OF MEDICINE AT SOUTH SHORE HEALTH. SO LET’S LET’S START WITH THIS CONDITION. OKAY. ABOUT ABOUT 30 MILLION PEOPLE. IT’S A SIZABLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE IT, BUT ONLY 6 MILLION ARE ACTUALLY DIAGNOSED. WHAT MAKES THIS SO HARD TO SPOT? RIGHT I THINK IT’S IMPORTANT. SO 80% OF PEOPLE WITH SLEEP APNEA DON’T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT. WHY? FIRST OF ALL, SOME PEOPLE SLEEP ALONE. OBVIOUSLY THEY DON’T HAVE A PARTNER THAT CAN RECOGNIZE YOU’RE STOPPING BREATHING, YOU’RE SNORING SO MUCH. THAT’S ONE REASON. YOU KNOW, ANOTHER REASON IS THAT TO REALLY FORMALLY DIAGNOSE IT, YOU NEED A SLEEP STUDY. NOW, THERE ARE WEARABLE DEVICES THAT ARE MAKING IT EASIER TO SPOT, BUT YOU STILL NEED THAT SLEEP STUDY. AND SOME PEOPLE, SOME OF US THINK WE’RE NOT SLEEPING A LOT, AND WE MAY WEAR IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR. WE’RE WORKING HARD, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS, IF YOU’RE NOT SLEEPING WELL, IF YOU WAKE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HEADACHES OR WHAT WE CALL DAYTIME SOMNOLENCE WHERE YOU’RE SLEEPING MORE THAN YOU SHOULD DURING THE DAY, YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT IT. SO SO YOU HAVE READ THIS, THIS STUDY, RIGHT? SO WHAT’S THE LINK TO IS THERE A LINK TO GLOBAL WARMING? RIGHT. THIS WAS A STUDY PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATION. LOOKED AT OVER 100,000 PEOPLE KIND OF RETROSPECTIVELY, AND SHOWED THAT IN THE PARTS OF THE WORLD, THIS WAS A GLOBAL STUDY. AND THE PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT WERE THE HOTTEST, THERE WAS A 45% INCREASE IN OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA. 45. THAT’S RIGHT. AND SO IT JUST SHOWS THAT WE KNOW THAT HOT WEATHER DISRUPTS OUR SLEEP CYCLE. IT LEADS TO SHALLOWER BREATHING. IT LEADS TO MORE FREQUENT AWAKENING. AND THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT REALLY IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY. YOU KNOW, OUR AIRWAY ABILITY. SO OUR RESEARCHERS IN THIS STUDY OFFERING ANY SOLUTIONS THERE ARE. REMEMBER, IF YOU’RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE THERE’S AIR CONDITIONING, THAT HELPS. BUT MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS IS SO IMPORTANT. THAT’S WHY I WANT TO TELL YOU AT SOUTH SHORE HEALTH, WE HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE SLEEP CENTER. WE DO 2000 THIS YEAR. WE’RE PROBABLY ON TRACK TO DO 3000 SLEEP STUDIES PER YEAR. OKAY. IT’S RUN BY A NEUROLOGIST, JAMIE JOHNSTON. SHE’S A WONDERFUL MEDICAL DIRECTOR. IT’S IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BRIGHAM. AND I JUST THINK I WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE, IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, GO AND TRY TO GET A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS. BUT IT’S A COMMITMENT. IT’S AN INVESTMENT. IT’S A WORTHY INVESTMENT. REMEMBER, YOU MAY HAVE THE REASON YOU’RE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IS REFRACTORY TO MEDS. COULD BE SLEEP APNEA. COULD BE OBESITY, CAN BE LINKED TO SLEEP APNEA, WORSENING DIABETES. A LOT OF THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW, IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO DRIVE MORE ACCIDENTS. SO THERE’S LOTS OF BENEFITS. WOW. ALL THOSE ALL THO

              &lt;p&gt;An immunocompromised woman’s cat stirred up a lot more trouble than usual (for a cat). In a recent case report, doctors detail how the feline likely spread a seldom-seen bacterial infection that landed its owner in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in Slovenia wrote the report, &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/6/25-0149_article"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the June issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases. The 56-year-old woman, a kidney transplant recipient, developed a severe, rare bout of &lt;em&gt;Mycoplasma arginini&lt;/em&gt; infection that was eventually traced back to her cat. Thankfully, the woman’s illness was identified in time for proper treatment, and she ultimately recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman first sought medical care after three weeks of swelling, redness, and pain in her left forearm. Though she was prescribed an oral antibiotic, her condition continued to worsen, and five days later, she was admitted to the hospital. By that point, the swelling and redness had spread to her left wrist, which she was barely able to move. Tests confirmed the infection had spread through the main wrist joint, tendons, and skin surrounding her hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors quickly suspected the woman had some kind of unusual germ in her arm, and testing confirmed the presence of &lt;em&gt;M. arginini &lt;/em&gt;bacteria. Mycoplasma bacteria in general are pretty weird, since they’re incredibly tiny and lack a cell wall (some species can also invade and hide inside our cells to replicate, much like viruses). This lack of a cell wall makes them invulnerable to many conventional antibiotics, likely explaining why the woman’s first treatment failed. The woman also reported that she had recently been bitten by her cat on her left arm.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;With the mystery solved, she was switched to more effective antibiotics. And though she did briefly develop other complications, she and her arm eventually improved enough to be discharged from the hospital. Later follow-up visits confirmed her infection had cleared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt; bacteria are commonly found in the respiratory and genital tracts of many animals, pets included. The report authors collected samples from the woman’s three cats and dog. They found some sort of mycoplasma bacteria in one of the cats but couldn’t definitely confirm whether it was &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt;. Still, given the recent cat bite and lack of other plausible explanations, the doctors concluded that her cat was the likely source of infection.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though there are some common mycoplasma infections in humans, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mgen/about/index.html"&gt;sexually transmitted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;M.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;genitalium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt; isn’t one of them. The doctors were only able to find a handful of other cases documented in the medical literature. And as with this case, most involved people with weakened immune systems. People who receive donated organs need constant immunosuppressing drugs to prevent rejection, and the woman had received two kidney transplants, the latest occurring in 2022. While the average person doesn’t have anything to fear from &lt;em&gt;M. arginini&lt;/em&gt;, doctors treating immunocompromised patients should be aware of its “potential as a pathogen,” the report authors say, especially if their patients are regularly exposed to animals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/treatment-for-dog-and-cat-bites-and-scratches"&gt;Cat bites in general&lt;/a&gt; aren’t something to dismiss, since our furry roommates can carry all sorts of germs capable of sickening even the healthiest people. So you should always quickly wash a cat bite or scratch with running water and soap for at least five minutes. You should also keep a close eye out afterward for signs of infection, such as redness and swelling, and see a doctor immediately if they appear (if you’re in poorer health or were bitten by an unfamiliar animal, you should seek medical care regardless, just in case).&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Scientists found that neurons in both flies and human models of tauopathy accumulate excess glycogen, which disrupts cellular stress management when it can’t be broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhancing the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP) helped redirect sugar metabolism into a protective pathway, reducing oxidative damage and extending lifespan in model organisms. The study also found that dietary restriction and certain drugs can boost GlyP activity, mimicking this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glycogen Accumulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons in Alzheimer’s models build up excess glycogen, worsening tau-related damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; Activating GlyP reroutes sugar into the PPP, reducing oxidative stress in neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Dietary restriction and drug treatments mimicking it improved brain health in both flies and human neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Buck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from scientists at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging has revealed a surprising player in the battle against Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia: brain sugar metabolism. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, the research uncovers how breaking down glycogen—a stored form of glucose—in neurons may protect the brain from toxic protein buildup and degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111333"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/sugar-metabolism-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Even more promising, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR)—a well-known intervention to extend lifespan—naturally enhanced GlyP activity and improved tau-related outcomes in flies. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycogen is typically thought of as a reserve energy source stored in the liver and muscles. While small amounts also exist in the brain, particularly in support cells called astrocytes, its role in neurons has long been dismissed as negligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new study challenges that view, and it does so with striking implications,” says Professor Pankaj Kapahi, PhD, senior scientist on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stored glycogen doesn’t just sit there in the brain; it is involved in pathology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by postdoc Sudipta Bar, PhD, discovered that in both fly and human models of tauopathy (a group of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s), neurons accumulate excessive glycogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, this buildup appears to contribute to disease progression. Bar says tau, the infamous protein that clumps into tangles in Alzheimer’s patients, appears to physically bind to glycogen, trapping it and preventing its breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When glycogen can’t be broken down, the neurons lose an essential mechanism for managing oxidative stress, a key feature in aging and neurodegeneration. By restoring the activity of an enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP)—which kicks off the process of glycogen breakdown—the researchers found they could reduce tau-related damage in fruit flies and human stem cell-derived neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than using glycogen as a fuel for energy production, these enzyme-supported neurons rerouted the sugar molecules into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)—a critical route for generating NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and Glutathione, molecules that protect against oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By increasing GlyP activity, the brain cells could better detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing damage and even extending the lifespan of tauopathy model flies,” said Bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more promising, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR)—a well-known intervention to extend lifespan—naturally enhanced GlyP activity and improved tau-related outcomes in flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They further mimicked these effects pharmacologically using a molecule called 8-Br-cAMP, showing that the benefits of DR might be reproduced through drug-based activation of this sugar-clearing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work could explain why GLP-1 drugs, now widely used for weight loss, show promise against dementia, potentially by mimicking dietary restriction,” said Kapahi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also confirmed similar glycogen accumulation and protective effects of GlyP in human neurons derived from patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), strengthening the potential for translational therapies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi says the study emphasizes the power of the fly as a model system in uncovering how metabolic dysregulation impacts neurodegeneration.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Work in this simple animal allowed us to move into human neurons in a much more targeted way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi also acknowledges the Buck’s highly collaborative atmosphere as a major factor in the work. His lab, with expertise in fly aging and neurodegeneration, took advantage of proteomics expertise in the Schilling lab and the Seyfried lab (at Emory University) as well as the Ellerby lab which has expertise in human iPSCs and neurodegeneration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapahi says this study not only highlights glycogen metabolism as an unexpected hero in the brain but also opens up a new direction in the search for treatments against Alzheimer’s and related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By discovering how neurons manage sugar, we may have unearthed a novel therapeutic strategy: one that targets the cell’s inner chemistry to fight age-related decline,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we continue to age as a society, findings like these offer hope that better understanding—and perhaps rebalancing—our brain’s hidden sugar code could unlock powerful tools for combating dementia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coauthors: &lt;/strong&gt;Additional Buck collaborators include Kenneth A.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing a great white shark anywhere on the planet is going to stop your heart for a moment, even if you’re watching it from behind a monitor. &lt;/strong&gt;They move like nothing else in the ocean and have a presence that’s unmatched. Still, watching a shark swim through the waters of a &lt;em&gt;lake &lt;/em&gt;is really going to grab some attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August, a photographer captured footage of a juvenile great white in Australia’s Lake Conjola. While the shark was awe-inspiring enough for the drone pilot Trent Micallef, it was something he realized while reviewing the footage days later that was most disturbing. Footage clearly shows something white trailing the shark as it moves through the water. He’d assumed in the moment that white tail was a remora fish. But Lake Conjola is a very popular tourist destination for fishermen, and Micallef eventually realized the white flag-looking thing trailing the shark was actually a fishing lure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a shame the effect we can have on them. I would love to have encounters like this more often but if things like this keep happening, we won’t get to have them anymore,” &lt;a href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/disturbing-discovery-after-great-white-shark-filmed-swimming-in-aussie-lake-050202152.html"&gt;he said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_aDggSSEP0/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shark scientist in Australia told &lt;em&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/em&gt; this particular juvenile likely found its way into the lake by following the salmon run to Australia’s South Coast and into the lake, pointing out that the migration is a sign of “the ocean working as it should.” Local fishermen had reportedly announced they planned to track the young predator down and catch it, but the shark had found its way out of the lake naturally shortly after Micallef’s footage went viral.&lt;/p&gt;

Inflammation protects the body from injury or infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is thought to speed up the ageing process and contribute to various health conditions such as &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/alzheimers-dementia-research-protein-ptau217-b2780235.html"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;disease, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/arthritis-flare-up-symptoms-advice-summer-b2770041.html"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/bulletin/lifestyle/alcohol-smoking-overweight-early-death-b2778438.html"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6146930/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Researchers have long believed that most older people will suffer from inflammageing as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the study, published in Nature Age this week, found that people in nonindustrialized areas experience inflammation differently than those in urban areas and there may be another cause behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers&lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nature.com%252Farticles%252Fs43587-025-00888-0%26sref%3D%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammaging-aging-national-institutes-health-b2780662.html&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammaging-aging-national-institutes-health-b2780662.html&amp;amp;article_id=2780662&amp;amp;author=Madeline+Sherratt&amp;amp;tag=Inflammation%2Caging%2CHeart+Disease%2CBiology%2CType+2+diabetes&amp;amp;section=Health&amp;amp;category=N%2FA&amp;amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;amp;updated_time=2025-07-01T19%3A31%3A25.000Z&amp;amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=N%2FA&amp;amp;ref=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;amp;gclid=N%2FA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared the lives of two indigenous, nonindustrialized populations - the Tsimane from the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli from Peninsular Malaysia - with two groups from Italy and Singapore. Researchers compared blood samples from about 2,800 adults between 18 and 95 in the four groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that chronic inflammation may not be linked explicitly to ageing, but rather that diet, lifestyle and environmental factors are more significant factors than previously thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that inflammation in the nonindustrialized groups did not appear to increase as subjects got older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Cohen, associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University and co-author of the study, said the findings suggest inflammation is “more complex than we currently understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gWMNUM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-49246"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Tsimane and Orang Asli differ from us in all these ways,” he told The Independent. “The insight of our study is not to say we need to be more active, but to challenge the idea that we understand biology well and can micromanage it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s a warning – don’t follow the latest trends of eating foods specifically to reduce inflammation, or whatever else the trend of the week may be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other experts shared a word of caution before jumping to conclusions from the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vishwa Deep Dixit, director of the Yale Center for Research on Aging, told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; it’s not surprising that people less exposed to pollution would see lower rates of chronic disease. The findings should lead to valuable discussion but would need further study “before we rewrite the inflammaging narrative,” professor of pharmacology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine Bimal Desai added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 19:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxONXdWQ1RkM1BMNTNyckZHel9kUGItelVFMndHYUxabUxCa3NiT3dGYnhna1dWbTB4REtoTklCQ2Zqa1pMUlVoZlhPZG01b1RuaU1PVFJWOWFHc0ZPb0xxcC1tbEZEZUV2dVZhaFFqSDJIMWtHejlTdElGTnpUZHBvUkotMkcwbmFNRkJIQVRqVDR3Qkp0dzZxRVVhVkFRZFNKV0RF</guid></item><item><title>科学家用电击学生的大脑以改善他们的数学学习- Live Science | Scientists zapped students' brains with electricity to improve their math learning - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQSjR2Wnp2SXd5Z19JU1gwbE5LSG9INldRTFQ2NExpSGtEX1NjRG05YzFyeW11VmRyN0JrQXMtcF9vMk5lSVlfdFVVOUVRaHhaVlJ1b0FqdHUyRFFBb2dzUjEzZ0JiR0E4OXN6MmUwVzRySV8tZVlkckRlZW5STndRZlpCMmhlbnpJYUtJWXdrTUJCWVZHMEtJcEI5eVVkbjRxS010XzQ0cw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperceptible electrical signals delivered to the brain can improve college students' mathematics skills, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say that the technology is not far from being ready for at-home use — though one expert emphasized that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers recruited 72 students from the University of Oxford. The researchers assessed the volunteers' &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/38936-mathematics.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/38936-mathematics.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;math&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; prowess with tests before dividing the students into three subgroups with matched abilities, meaning each group had a mix of people with weaker and stronger math skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the experiment, individuals in each group had electrodes placed on their scalps that could deliver mild electrical signals to the brain. Two of the groups received stimulation to either the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) or the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) — brain areas linked to math ability in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763409000402?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763409000402?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The third group received a sham stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then applied transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), which is just one of many types of non-invasive brain stimulation but is known to be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245710003731?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245710003731?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more comfortable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than other options. The current passed through the scalp is very low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the people do not feel whether they're stimulated or not," said senior author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/roi-cohen-kadosh" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/roi-cohen-kadosh" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roi Cohen Kadosh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the University of Surrey. Each participant in the treated groups received 150 minutes of stimulation, paired with math tests, over five days of testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/neurons-for-walking-after-spine-injury" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/neurons-for-walking-after-spine-injury"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical zaps can 'reawaken' lost neural connections, helping paralyzed people walk again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pjqXkJZxxKJ8LNsYZA6RP8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pjqXkJZxxKJ8LNsYZA6RP8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests assessed the students' calculation skills and "drill learning." Calculation learning requires existing mathematical ability and challenges participants to work out the answer to a presented problem. Drill learning, in contrast, requires no mathematical ability and instead asks users to memorize a series of presented equations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on past research, the authors hypothesized that dlPFC stimulation would enhance calculation learning, because this area is associated with learning new skills and high-level cognition. They thought that stimulating the PPC, meanwhile, which handles the retrieval of already learned skills, might enhance drill learning. In the study, they found dlPFC stimulation was indeed tied to improved calculation ability but PPC stimulation didn't improve drill learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before testing began, the team had measured the connectivity of their participants' frontal and parietal lobes, found at the front and on the top of the brain. These two lobes are the sites of the dlPFC and PPC, respectively, and are activated together during math learning. The team hypothesized that having stronger connections between the two lobes would be linked to stronger calculation learning. This was borne out by the data: at baseline, the team observed a stronger connection in participants with better calculation abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with weaker connectivity who were in the sham stimulation group had a harder time getting to grips with the calculation problems than those with stronger connectivity in the same group. But individuals with weak connections who had their dlPFC stimulated showed the biggest improvements in their scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8954921879204025735&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs41465-019-00126-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fzapping-the-brain-may-help-boost-math-skills-study-hints" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-019-00126-7" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs41465-019-00126-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fzapping-the-brain-may-help-boost-math-skills-study-hints" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an earlier, small study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the team undertook with a cohort of math professors showed that stimulation actually worsened the pros' performance on math tests. This suggests those who already have high math ability should avoid stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an optimal system," Kadosh said of the math professors' brains. "You enter new noise into that, it's going to cause a detrimental effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kadosh is the co-founder of Cognite Neurotechnology, a brain stimulation company, and is optimistic about rolling out the technology to the general public. Kadosh said that people in universities, workplaces and training centers could all benefit from it. He added that he was interested in expanding the technology to people with learning difficulties and neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=sungjoo" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=sungjoo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sung Joo Kim&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a psychologist at Binghamton University who was not involved in the research, noted that while similar stimulation devices have already been cleared for at-home use, analyses looking at how well they work have made it clear that more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim added that such devices may need to be personalized to individual users to reflect &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5539401/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5539401/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;differences in their brain shapes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "When you're targeting to stimulate certain brain regions, it might not necessarily work so well unless you really consider the brain anatomical structure of individual people," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kadosh also said that any consumer devices borne of the research need to be anchored to solid evidence, and he argued that many existing consumer brain-stimulation devices have little scientific basis. "We need to show that we can use this technology at home," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/brain-quiz-test-your-knowledge-of-the-most-complex-organ-in-the-body"&gt;Brain quiz&lt;/a&gt;: Test your knowledge of the most complex organ in the body&lt;/h2&gt;
