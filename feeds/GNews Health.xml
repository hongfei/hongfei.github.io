&lt;p&gt;Malaria continues to kill over &lt;strong&gt;600,000 people&lt;/strong&gt; each year, despite decades of global intervention. But a surprising new strategy could soon shift the balance: a &lt;strong&gt;repurposed drug&lt;/strong&gt; that makes &lt;strong&gt;human blood&lt;/strong&gt; lethal to the very &lt;strong&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt; that spread the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt;, a medication developed decades ago, can kill mosquitoes within hours after they feed on blood containing even small doses of the drug. The approach doesn’t protect individuals directly from infection, but it could reduce &lt;strong&gt;mosquito populations&lt;/strong&gt; enough to slow or halt the spread of &lt;strong&gt;malaria&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Turning Blood Into a Mosquito Killer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr4827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, highlight how a low dose of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; can render blood lethal to mosquitoes. After feeding on treated blood, the insects died within hours. Remarkably, the drug remained active for up to &lt;strong&gt;16 days&lt;/strong&gt; in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This indirect method of control focuses on stopping the parasite’s transmission cycle by targeting mosquitoes before they can lay eggs. Scientists compare it to the principle behind &lt;strong&gt;herd immunity&lt;/strong&gt;, where protection arises not from individual immunity, but from coordinated, community-wide intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers caution that the drug is not intended as a stand-alone solution, but as part of an integrated approach that could include &lt;strong&gt;bed nets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;insecticides&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;malaria vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;, and other control strategies. This method could be especially valuable in areas where mosquitoes have already developed &lt;strong&gt;insecticide resistance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Herbicide to Human Medicine to Mosquito Control&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The history of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; is unusual. It was originally developed as an &lt;strong&gt;herbicide&lt;/strong&gt; based on a natural toxin from the &lt;strong&gt;Australian bottlebrush plant&lt;/strong&gt;. Its mechanism involved disrupting &lt;strong&gt;tyrosine&lt;/strong&gt;, an amino acid crucial to plant metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Later, researchers discovered that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; could help treat &lt;strong&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/strong&gt; in humans, including &lt;strong&gt;tyrosinemia type I&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;alkaptonuria&lt;/strong&gt;—conditions where the body can’t properly break down tyrosine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Approved by the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/strong&gt; in 1992, the drug became a lifesaving treatment for children with these rare diseases. “This is the only thing that has kept children with tyrosinemia type I alive,” said &lt;a href="https://biology.nd.edu/people/alvaro-acosta-serrano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Álvaro Acosta Serrano&lt;/a&gt;, a coauthor of the new study and a &lt;strong&gt;parasitologist&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While side effects exist in patients who need high doses of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt;, researchers emphasize that the amount required to affect mosquitoes is significantly lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Biological Weakness Exploited&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery that nitisinone could target &lt;strong&gt;blood-feeding insects&lt;/strong&gt; goes back to 2016, when Brazilian researchers &lt;strong&gt;Marcos Sterkel&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pedro Oliveira&lt;/strong&gt; found that mosquitoes, flies, and fleas rely on &lt;strong&gt;tyrosine metabolism&lt;/strong&gt; to process blood meals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The insects are flooded with tyrosine after feeding, and if that processing system is disrupted, they die. The researchers approached Acosta Serrano’s lab, which had studied &lt;strong&gt;tsetse flies&lt;/strong&gt;, another blood-sucking parasite, to test the drug’s effect. The team later expanded the work to focus on mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; already has &lt;strong&gt;FDA approval&lt;/strong&gt;, it may face fewer regulatory barriers in its new application. It’s been approved for &lt;strong&gt;newborns&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;children&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;pregnant individuals&lt;/strong&gt; and has not been linked to adverse effects, making it an attractive candidate for broader use in &lt;strong&gt;public health&lt;/strong&gt; campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Promising but Complex Solution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts in the field view the findings as exciting but recognize challenges. &lt;strong&gt;George Dimopoulos&lt;/strong&gt;, a molecular biologist at the &lt;strong&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/strong&gt;, called the study “very interesting” and noted that side effects from &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; appear less severe than those from &lt;strong&gt;ivermectin&lt;/strong&gt;, another drug previously studied for reducing &lt;strong&gt;malaria transmission&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One hurdle is &lt;strong&gt;cost&lt;/strong&gt;. Because nitisinone is currently used to treat rare conditions, it remains &lt;strong&gt;expensive&lt;/strong&gt;. Acosta Serrano believes that with more interest, production costs could be lowered by as much as &lt;strong&gt;80 percent&lt;/strong&gt;. But price isn’t the only concern. Since the drug doesn’t directly protect the individual taking it, there could be resistance to its widespread adoption. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s always tricky to convince people to take a drug that doesn’t protect them,” Dimopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are exploring whether the drug could be delivered in different ways. Treating &lt;strong&gt;livestock&lt;/strong&gt;, which attract mosquitoes, could be one solution. Another involves &lt;strong&gt;insecticide-laced nectar bags&lt;/strong&gt; designed to draw mosquitoes while avoiding harm to other pollinators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In theory, nitisinone could be administered via this method as well. Dimopoulos notes, “You would not necessarily have to administer it to humans.” As with any &lt;strong&gt;mosquito control&lt;/strong&gt; strategy, the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;resistance&lt;/strong&gt; developing remains. Still, both Acosta Serrano and Dimopoulos agree that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; could be a valuable addition to a diversified and &lt;strong&gt;population-specific&lt;/strong&gt; approach to malaria control. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In some places, drugs combined with the vaccines could work better,” Dimopoulos explained. “In other places, &lt;strong&gt;insecticide spraying&lt;/strong&gt; and new technologies, like &lt;strong&gt;genetically engineered mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, could have greater efficacy.” He added, “There is no silver bullet for malaria. And I don’t think there will ever be a silver bullet.”&lt;/p&gt;

Two years later, a neurologist confirmed that Krehbiel had Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWTYO5WRTVGCRGTPLJCQPM3UOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He was prescribed medications to help control motor symptoms since no cure exists for Parkinson’s disease. They, however, came with disabling &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00023210-200721080-00005" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as nausea, low blood pressure, compulsive behavior and gastrointestinal issues. Patients may also experience hallucinations, excessive daytime sleepiness and involuntary, erratic movements called dyskinesias as complications from some Parkinson’s medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YDYDLZ3QBREYFC5J7XMOTZ2Y2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I had terrible sleep.

In February, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://news.medtronic.com/2025-02-24-Medtronic-earns-U-S-FDA-approval-for-the-worlds-first-Adaptive-deep-brain-stimulation-system-for-people-with-Parkinsons" target="_blank"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the first adaptive DBS system for people with Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PNUX6HZRGJEDHBTT4BQHSCKH5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“For some patients, especially people who have more severe symptoms, standard DBS that is always on at one constant setting doesn’t give them enough benefit,” said &lt;a href="https://starrlab.ucsf.edu/people/philip-starr" target="_blank"&gt;Philip Starr,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of neurological surgery at the University of California at San Francisco. “The needs of the brain change depending on their activity level, such as when they’re awake versus asleep, and particularly according to their medication cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WM2JDUTWU5HSRB7C4F3ZK74NYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Like the heart, the brain has normal rhythms or patterns of electrical activity produced by neurons. Medical conditions such as epilepsy and schizophrenia are associated with abnormal brain rhythms, similar to cardiac arrhythmias. In Parkinson’s disease, neurons become overly synchronized in what is known as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B978012819410200014X" target="_blank"&gt;oscillopathy&lt;/a&gt;, which may interfere with the normal transfer of information and lead to symptoms such as tremors and stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ARWUQAXMBBGLNKZ77RJCQK7DCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Imagine you’re in a crowd, and there’s a hum of conversation, but you can easily hear yourself talk — that’s the normal broadband neural activity situation,” said &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/b/helen-brontestewart.html" target="_blank"&gt;Helen Bronte-Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. “But with oscillopathy, it’s as if you’re in a protest march where everybody’s chanting the same thing, and you can’t hear yourself speak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ZDQGCYID6JCNTMOCPXWIV2Z4MY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="ZDQGCYID6JCNTMOCPXWIV2Z4MY"&gt;Adaptive DBS adjusts stimulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FXSLCURLA5DJNFYYYN52OBSM4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both DBS and Parkinson’s medications have been shown to dampen oscillopathy in the brain. In particular, the steady electrical pulses from DBS help pace the neuronal firing in a way that overrides the hyper-synchronization of oscillopathy, returning the brain rhythms back to normal, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KGKOSIN4NZG4JGA4EYNAVCRWSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, conventional DBS delivers electrical stimulation at a constant, “always on” setting, which can lead to periods of under-stimulation and overstimulation that result in slowness of movement or dyskinesias, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHWHQ6PVTVGAZAHO7XGZ4YLJMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Adaptive DBS, on the other hand, detects real-time neural signals and automatically adjusts stimulation in response to oscillopathy or other biomarkers.

A 100-year-old man, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr John Scharenberg,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; who has spent a lifetime studying health and wellness, shares seven key principles for longevity. These are not just theories but proven lifestyle habits that have helped many people avoid chronic diseases and stay active well into old age. Here is all we need to know about these life-changing principles that can help maintain good health for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid tobacco completely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

He said in a TED Talks that the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/nn/feature/smoking#:~:text=The%20report%20highlighted%20the%20deleterious,of%20smokers%20over%20non%2Dsmokers." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1964 Surgeon General’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; report made it clear that smoking is dangerous, yet many still struggle to quit. The doctor points out that people who avoid smoking live longer and are at a significantly lower risk of developing diseases like Alzheimer’s and heart attacks. Simply put, staying away from tobacco is one of the best decisions for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Say no to alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption has long been debated, but new research shows that even small amounts can increase health risks. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827822030616" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;large-scale study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that there is no truly “safe” level of alcohol. Even moderate drinking raises the risk of cancer, liver disease, and cardiovascular issues. While many believe a glass of wine is harmless, this doctor strongly advises cutting out alcohol altogether for better health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise every day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sedentary lifestyle is one of the biggest risk factors for early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Immediate%20benefits&amp;amp;text=Regular%20physical%20activity%20can%20help,of%20physical%20activity%20happen%20immediately." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; helps maintain heart health, strengthen muscles, and improve mental well-being. The doctor emphasizes that midlife (ages 40-70) is the most critical time to stay active. Those who exercise daily, regardless of their weight or health conditions, tend to outlive those who remain inactive. Walking, swimming, and strength training are all great ways to stay fit and add years to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maintain a healthy weight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk of almost &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks#:~:text=Having%20overweight%20or%20obesity%20increases,the%20cells%20in%20your%20body." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;every major disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. However, the doctor explains that even those who are overweight can improve their health dramatically through regular exercise. He also highlights that many people overeat due to food addiction, which is similar to substance addiction. Identifying the root cause of overeating and making conscious dietary changes can significantly improve health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cut down on sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive sugar consumption has been linked to obesity, diabetes, and even heart attacks. Many people unknowingly consume too much sugar, whether through processed foods, sweetened beverages, or even daily desserts. The doctor shares a case study of a patient whose cholesterol and triglycerides skyrocketed due to a nightly habit of eating large amounts of ice cream. Cutting back on sugar can lead to better heart health, balanced energy levels, and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reduce meat consumption&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet high in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2943062/#:~:text=Dietary%20saturated%20fat%20intake%20has,of%20cardiovascular%20disease%20(CVD)." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, particularly from animal sources, can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. While many are reluctant to give up meat, health organisations now recommend prioritising plant-based foods. The American Heart Association suggests reducing saturated fat intake, which effectively promotes a more plant-based diet. The doctor highlights that a vegetarian or plant-focused diet is scientifically proven to support longevity and lower disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;World health day: Doctors share strange questions they get asked by patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus on preventive health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention is better than cure. The doctor stresses that most chronic diseases, including heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes, can be prevented through lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6378495/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that lifestyle modifications can lower heart attack risk, stroke risk and diabetes risk—without the need for medication.

&lt;p&gt;The paper has attracted a spotlight because it was written by Martin Kulldorff, a collaborator of the agency’s new director, Jay Bhattacharya, who is also on the editorial board of the publication, called the Journal of the Academy of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blueprint has 12 proposals for the agency, which range from breaking it into pieces to changing the ways researchers are funded to conducting more long-term studies to the creation of a “Covid Commission” to investigate the agency’s handling of the pandemic.  As a whole, the proposal is something of a referendum on the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that NIH failed us during the pandemic, and to restore trust in science, we have to change the way we operate as a scientific community, and have to change the NIH, and I think one key aspect is to be more open and transparent and have open scientific discourse,” Kulldorff said in an interview.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts on science policy who reviewed the paper for STAT said it largely relitigates the NIH’s performance during the pandemic, and is at times correct in its diagnoses of problems at the agency but is biased by Kulldorff’s personal experience. During the pandemic, Kulldorff and Bhattacharya were criticized for writing &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Great Barrington Declaration&lt;/a&gt;, an open letter they co-authored that challenged the need for most social distancing efforts and called for less stringent public health measures in the first year of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think we shouldn’t be Covid-obsessed when we think about NIH reform, and this set of proposals is. It makes sense given who the author is, right? He has an ax to grind, and I don’t blame him for having an ax to grind, but that ends up coloring the tenor of what reform would look like,” said Pierre Azoulay, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied the NIH and &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/04/opinion/national-institutes-health-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;advocated for reform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Several of the proposals line up with policies already put forth by the Trump administration. The paper calls for the same payment rate for indirect research costs for all institutions, a measure that the administration attempted to implement but that has been halted for now by a federal judge. It also emphasizes “academic freedom and open scientific discourse.” In an email to staff on his first day in office, Bhattacharya lists “academic freedom” as one of his top five priorities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper also proposes basing decisions about making large grants on the applicant’s previous research, as opposed to proposed experiments, and providing training funding directly to universities to disburse, rather than have these awards be judged by an NIH panel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experts who spoke with STAT supported the idea of minimizing the time that researchers spend writing grant proposals and justifying funding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​Researchers spend way too much time just chasing after money,” said Stuart Buck, the executive director of the Good Science Project, a science policy think tank. “If you look at some of the best places that did research historically, like Bell Labs, scientists had a job, they had funding, it was centrally funded. They didn’t have to spend half their time writing up proposals for why they deserved money and deserve to get a salary and deserve to have a little lab space and so forth.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But making NIH funding dependent on a researcher’s previous “first-author” publications, as Kullfdorff proposed, could also create inequities in who can apply for those funds. This approach is similar to how the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which attempts to fund bold and innovative research, makes funding decisions. But, there are also biases in who is funded by the HHMI, the largest private funder of biomedical research, the experts said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The best predictor of whether you get a Hughes position is whether you work in the lab of somebody else who had a Hughes position, or whether you work in the lab of somebody who is in the National Academy of Sciences. So there’s a huge bias toward the in crowd,” said Jeremy Berg, an associate dean and professor at the University of Pittsburgh who previously led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at NIH. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Berg and others noted that in areas they agreed with the proposal, like requiring projects with NIH funding to have open data, or requiring publication in journals with open peer-review, there was little reference to previously published research that examined the pros and cons of similar reform ideas. “It’s relatively easy to pose the problem, and say, ‘We just need to do this.’ Then when you actually try to think about how you would do that, it turns out that it’s flawed, and leads to all kinds of unintended consequences, and is basically unworkable,” Berg said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, some outside experts were concerned about proposals that could signal retribution toward the NIH and others that disagreed with Bhattacharya and Kulldorff during the pandemic. In writing about academic freedom, Kulldorff writes that individuals should not be discriminated against on factors including vaccination history, ethical convictions, and political beliefs. That section ends by saying, “Digressions during the pandemic should be rectified.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This looks like it was a setup to punish organizations, institutions and individuals that did things during the pandemic that they don’t like,” said Keith Yamamoto, vice chancellor of science policy and strategy at the University of California, San Francisco, who recently led a group who wrote a report on &lt;a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/492769090/2/#zoom=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;optimizing the NIH&lt;/a&gt;. “I worry that this is a call for retribution for people who didn’t agree with what Bhattacharya wanted to do to open up society during the pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berg said former colleagues at the NIH have been passing around the blueprint, to understand what changes might be coming to the agency. When asked if he had discussed the paper with Bhattacharya, Kulldorff responded, “you have to ask him what he thinks about these proposals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Bhattacharya and the NIH did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, given Bhattacharya’s connections to Killdorff and the journal, researchers have continued speculating. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you told me this is what’s getting implemented, I’d be very worried. I think that they’re not, in their current form, particularly helpful,” Azoulay said. “Of course, everyone who reads this is wondering, ‘Is this what Jay thinks? If that’s the case, then we worry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The internet is flooded with millions of restrictive diets and hard-hitting workouts. But how do you know what’s better for you? Curating what works for you is indeed crucial. But everyone with weight loss goals must have come across interesting fasting and calorie-deficit diets. Which one is better? Well, scientists have finally unraveled the mystery. A new study has found that intermittent fasting provides greater weight loss than traditional daily calorie-restrictive diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine published their findings in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that the 4:3 plan, a popular type of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/intermittent-fasting-what-are-the-best-hours-for-intermittent-fasting/articleshow/117051664.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (IMF), where individuals eat freely for four days a week and follow intense calorie restriction for three days a week, had an average body weight loss of 7.6% at the one-year mark compared with 5% in the daily caloric restriction (DCR) group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though previous studies have looked into both intermittent and calorie deficit diets, they reported no notable difference between the two diet strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising and exciting to me that it was better,” Victoria Catenacci, MD, co-lead author and associate professor of endocrinology at the CU School of Medicine said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more important message to me is that this is a dietary strategy that is an evidence-based alternative, especially for people who have tried DCR and found it difficult,” Catenacci added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the best diet, the researchers randomly assigned 165 adults with overweight or obesity to either &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:3 intermittent fasting or calorie restriction for 12 months. Participants in the 4:3 intermittent fasting group fasted three nonconsecutive days a week, reducing their calorie intake by 80% on those days. On the other four days, they could eat freely but were encouraged to make healthy choices. The calorie restriction group, on the other hand, followed a daily calorie limit designed to cut their energy intake by 34.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which diet strategy do you find more appealing for weight loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were given a free gym membership and were encouraged to exercise for 300 minutes per week. They also got group support, calorie counting guidance, and dietary recommendations (to target 55% carbs, 15% protein, and 30% fat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to lose weight through intermittent fasting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the year, participants in the intermittent fasting group had a 7.6% change in body weight. The calorie deficit group only exhibited a 5% change. 58% of those in the fasting group achieved weight loss of at least 5% at 12 months vs 47% in the calorie restriction group. Individuals in the IMF achieved great cardiometabolic outcomes including systolic blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting glucose levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also stressed that fasting does not require counting calories, and restrictive diets every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>OSDH confirms measles case in OKC, identifies potential exposure site - News on 6</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOUkMwbG8ydWVwaW9iR1hHMHZoN3NRNlRSSlZabVNITjdnYTVvU05sMU9abENFck9oanJjaVBoVVRJMG9jalBhTVB2RlpZaTFONEdyLU45VDJVSHVKc2xfZXQ3ZTBObWZZZ28wTl9LRXh1UkJfVlEwR1dOQkdRN2FDOFZUNktxbUpaODZZMHBRNEdKZklzalpmcGEyb211X1Z2bm51OUJJRTB3V1BfR2o3QzhuaWZubVlDREZPZkFacDM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnm-article gnm-ty-article"&gt;

Hydration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per the gastroenterologist, chia seeds absorb up to 12 times their weight in water. This helps you stay &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/want-hair-that-is-soft-fresh-shiny-ultra-hydrated-while-travelling-follow-these-5-tips-101742549940078.html"&gt;hydrated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from hydration, they are also packed with fibre and omega-3 fatty acids. Their high fibre content makes them great for digestion, which can help you ‘feel fuller for longer’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Weight management&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of eating chia seeds regularly is that it can assist you in weight management as it helps you feel fuller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Radiant skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, explaining chia seeds' benefits for your skin, Dr Sethi said, “Chia seeds provide hydration and antioxidants that can benefit your skin as well. So, you may notice subtle improvements in your skin texture and radiance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that you know the benefits of eating chia seeds, it is also important to know the correct way to consume them. Eating it dry could lead to health complications. Recently, in an &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/are-you-eating-chia-seeds-the-wrong-way-doctor-explains-the-right-way-of-consuming-the-superfood-101742614879713.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Kunal Sood, double board-certified MD, shared the proper method for incorporating chia seeds into your diet. “Soak chia seeds for about 10 to 15 minutes before eating. Start with small amounts and ensure you drink enough water to prevent digestive discomfort, as chia seeds absorb moisture from your body,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - because if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? "I'm all in," he replies. "I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;His family ask for one last photo, which I take. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house the previous day. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is "guaranteed" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Dr Donnie Moore has been involved in dozens of assisted deaths&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle," he said. "I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes," he told me. "I want none of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne said he had watched two relatives die "miserable", "heinous" deaths from heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He has less than six months to live, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Wayne sits surrounded by his family on the day of his death&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one," he said. "People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Stella, 78, supports his decision. "I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed," Michelle told me. "I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care… I have God and I have good medicine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Michelle Carter is placing her trust in medicine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to "silent coercion" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. "Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people," he said. "Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that "you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: "The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"What does that say about who we are as a culture?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a "slippery slope" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. "There's that mockingbird out there," Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. "Goodnight," he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Moore tells the family this is "the deepest sleep imaginable" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, "did it work?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Oh that would be just like him," Stella says with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Wayne and his family shortly before his death&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. "Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back," says Ashley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was "always walking, always outdoors, always active", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, "I think he's passed… He's at peace now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent.

It hides in nerves and can break out when the immune system weakens from illness or age, causing painful, blister-like sores typically on one side of the body that last for weeks – what’s called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RTVJKAWGT5BKNI45HGEAZXIPBE"&gt;About 1 in 3 Americans will get shingles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most recover, it sometimes causes &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/dianne-feinstein-shingles-complications-encephalitis-0b89e58478eb8f1785886ed9a9eda801" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;severe complications.&lt;/a&gt; If it infects an eye it can cause vision loss. Up to 20% of shingles patients suffer excruciating nerve pain months or even years after the rash itself is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;What’s the link between shingles and dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ABEFGVXMW5BFXL2OLRRRN6YJ6E"&gt;It’s not clear exactly how Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia form. But certain viruses that sneak inside the nervous system – especially members of the herpes family including the chickenpox virus -- have long been suspected of adding to genetic and other factors that make people more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="COTAPUP7LVGUJI4EXN7G7SQCJI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-024-01511-x" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Last summer&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital reported that an episode of shingles could raise someone’s risk of dementia by about 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LOM7RI4WXRDAJEOVJL4REG52IE"&gt;Partly, it’s because that virus can cause inflammation, bad for organs including the brain. It also can directly infect blood vessels in the brain, causing clots and impeding blood flow, said Colorado’s Nagel, a risk both for strokes and for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" class="middleParagraph"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YU4MW6UCXNBWVLH4PXH73ZTJVU"&gt;More intriguing, her lab also discovered shingles can spur formation of a sticky protein called amyloid that’s one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Do shingles vaccines protect against dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4NU445RV6FECBIRPWPCIQS4G3Y"&gt;Adults who get recommended vaccines tend to have other brain-healthy habits including exercising and a good diet, which made it hard to prove an extra benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7RP2TFWQUFDCTBR4L467RHGM7A"&gt;Stanford’s Geldsetzer took advantage of “a natural experiment” in Wales, which opened shingles vaccinations with an age limit: anyone 80 or older on Sept. 1, 2013, was ineligible but those still 79 could squeeze in. Comparing seniors who just met or just missed that cutoff would mimic a research study that randomly assigned otherwise similar people to be vaccinated or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ORXOCWPTYNH3RF4CREW4ILG2AA"&gt;Geldsetzer’s team analyzed more than 280,000 medical records and found evidence that vaccination did offer some protection against dementia. At the time, people received a first-generation vaccine called Zostavax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VAZZEHLBWBG43K54RIIDT5VS24"&gt;An important next step is testing whether today’s vaccine, Shingrix, also offers dementia protection, Nagel said. Another research group recently reported some evidence that it does. Vaccine manufacturer GSK last month announced a collaboration with UK health officials to track seniors’ cognitive health as they get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XQ5M6DJHY5FJ7KWHO7JXBDNOF4"&gt;Geldsetzer also hopes to further study that earlier shot to see if the type of vaccine might make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-22"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;What are the shingles vaccine recommendations?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-23"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DMI3HN5Q45EB7HDPZAKQRZBFKA"&gt;Shingrix is a onetime vaccination, given in two doses a few months apart. The CDC recommends it starting at age 50 for most people but also for younger adults with certain immune-weakening conditions – including those who years ago got that first-generation shingles vaccine. Fewer than 40% of eligible Americans have gotten vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ADIDDELFFRDXLDUCBYWNOUO4XA"&gt;Side effects including injection-site pain and flu-like fever and achiness are common. The CDC cautions if you’re currently fighting another virus such as the flu or COVID-19, to wait on a shingles shot until you’re well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZTCU6FJI3JFNJHZ5XI37ZPIUWE"&gt;While there’s no proven prevention for dementia, doctors also recommend other commonsense steps to lower the risk. Stay socially and cognitively active. And control high blood pressure and, for people with diabetes, high blood sugar, both of which are linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CXGRLEN5J5HFZOORRI4BAPI7DU" data-fusion-component="CXGRLEN5J5HFZOORRI4BAPI7DU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CXGRLEN5J5HFZOORRI4BAPI7DU" data-fusion-component="CXGRLEN5J5HFZOORRI4BAPI7DU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XSHXECY5TFE4NCNFO7BKDHT24M"&gt;&lt;i&gt;-- Lauran Neergaard, The Associated Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="W6CKBVQSYRDKBOMLIH5VJ7UBRE"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

He was losing hair, revealing patches of black skin underneath. Evidently itchy, he was scratching and rubbing himself against his enclosure. Kathryn Gamble, the zoo's director of veterinary medicine, had a hunch what was wrong: allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But what would a polar bear be allergic to? Gamble and her colleagues anaesthetized Siku and conducted a skin test, injecting small amounts of various allergy-provoking substances into his skin. Siku's skin reacted against house mites, as well as elm, mulberry and red cedar pollen. Oddly enough, "one of the things that he initially showed a very strong response to on his skin was actually human hair dander", Gamble recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;For a long time, studies of animals have been used to better understand health conditions in people, but allergies are a rare case where lessons learned in humans may help animals – Andrew Flies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Fortunately for itchy animals living in captivity like Siku, animal allergies are treatable, just like in humans. But these cases may also tell us something deeper about how and why allergies develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Scientists speculate that animals get allergies for similar reasons as people in many Western countries – especially those living in cities – who are currently experiencing a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952791501002825" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;rise in allergies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some experts blame the fact that pets, as well as farm and zoo animals, are increasingly being raised in manmade environments where they're less exposed to the parasites, microbes and other pathogens that they evolved with, causing their immune system to go awry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"In dogs and cats, the numbers definitely have gone up, as the numbers in people have gone up," says Annette Petersen, a veterinary dermatologist at Michigan State University. "I wouldn't be surprised if more zoo animals [are getting] allergies too," she adds – although no research has yet looked into whether or not this is the case.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Allergy symptoms can vary across animals. Humans and other primates that inhale allergy-causing substances through the nose often develop hay fever-type symptoms, with discharge, sneezing and weepy eyes.

While some experts used to solely blame the fact that humans are increasingly growing up in cleaner, more hygienic environments where they're less exposed to microbes than in the wild, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/ITT.S61528" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;research is now pointing&lt;/a&gt; to a wider set of factors that also involves the loss of important microbes and parasites that live in and on our bodies, says Andrea Graham, a parasitologist at Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;It may be that zoo animals are so well cared for they develop allergies as a side effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Frequent cleaning and soaps likely contributes to our reduced exposure to these organisms, alongside the use of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://aacijournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13223-020-00432-2" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;antibiotic drugs&lt;/a&gt; and ointments, greater distancing from domesticated animals and parasite-free food, Graham says.

Now, without these organisms to rein in and train our immune response, our immune system is more likely to go into overdrive, including against harmless pathogens, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some of the best evidence for this theory comes from studies of Amish populations in the US. One 2016 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1508749" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; compared Amish children in Indiana state, who use traditional farming practices and are exposed to lots of microbes through interactions with farm animals and house dust, with children from Hutterite communities in South Dakota, who use highly industrialised farming practices and live in households less exposed to dust and animals. Though both populations were genetically very similar, "the rate of allergies was about four times higher in the Hutterites who had taken on modern industrial farming", says Andrew Flies, an immunologist at the University of Tasmania's Menzies Institute for Medical Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbmj.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Rhinoceroses in captivity have also been found to have developed allergies, including severe rashes, bloody ulcerations and weeping infections (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Rhinoceroses in captivity have also been found to have developed allergies, including severe rashes, bloody ulcerations and weeping infections (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Flies, Petersen, Graham and Rosenberg all suspect that animals kept in households, farms and zoos might develop allergies for similar reasons. They typically get dewormed and vaccinated to prevent infections, and are generally less exposed to the bacteria and parasites they evolved with compared to their relatives in the wild, Graham says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For zoo animals, Petersen says, "the food they're eating is parasite-free and probably not heavily bacterially contaminated". Compare that to a bacteria-smothered cadaver a lion would eat in the Serengeti, probably together with the prey's microbe- and parasite-containing guts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In other words, it may be that animals are so well cared for in zoos they develop allergies as a side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While no-one has yet published a specific study looking into this, Flies and others suspect that allergies are much more common in these more human environments than in the wilderness. In the wild, allergies might affect the survival of animals – for instance if allergic animals scratch themselves and develop infections, Flies says. Petersen recalls a lion with allergies she once treated who had developed a bad ear infection. "If he can't hear well in the wild – if the ears are plugged with pus and stuff from the infection – that would obviously be a major disadvantage," she says. For these reasons, allergies may have disappeared from wild populations.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But that theory is tough to prove. Animals in the wild may well have allergies, Gamble says – but we would be less likely to spot them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What may have contributed to Siku's allergies, Gamble adds, is the fact that he had been moved to Chicago two years before he started developing them. Often, "if a person moves to a new environment where they're exposed to pollens that their bodies have never seen before, they have a response to it," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Other factors may also be contributing to allergies in animals. Rosenberg says that in his clinic in the northeastern US, where he's seen rising cases of pet allergies, this may be linked to climate change, which is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28764-0" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;causing&lt;/a&gt; higher pollen counts and longer allergy seasons. "It's my impression that we're seeing more common allergies and we're seeing more severe allergies than ever before," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As awareness around animal allergies is growing, so is knowledge on how to treat them. Rosenberg was able to treat the allergic rhinoceroses with an approach similar to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/allergy-shots/about/pac-20392876" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;allergy shots in people&lt;/a&gt;, injecting them with small doses of the allergy-provoking substances and gradually dialling up the dose to teach their immune systems that they don't represent a threat and to lessen their response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l1qbp4.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Lincoln Park Zoo After treatment of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey, Siku became much less reactive to these substances (Credit: Lincoln Park Zoo)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Lincoln Park Zoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;After treatment of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey, Siku became much less reactive to these substances (Credit: Lincoln Park Zoo)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Siku the polar bear received a similar treatment, receiving a combination of allergy-provoking substances mixed into organic honey – the licking of which helped the substances get absorbed through the soft tissues in his mouth. Honey has the added benefit of containing some local pollen itself, Gamble adds.

In a rat model, animals exposed to high alcohol levels performed significantly worse on a complex, shifting-reward task, even after nearly three months of sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These decision-making deficits were linked to weakened neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum, a brain region crucial for evaluating choices. The findings suggest that alcohol-induced brain changes may underlie poor judgment and relapse in people with alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; Alcohol-exposed rats showed impaired decision-making months after withdrawal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Brain Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Damage was found in the dorsomedial striatum, a decision-making hub.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex Differences Noted:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were seen in male rats but not females, suggesting sex-based variability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;JHU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time researchers demonstrate in an animal how heavy alcohol use leads to long-term behavioral issues by damaging brain circuits critical for decision-making.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rats exposed to high amounts of alcohol exhibited poor decision-making during a complex task even after a monthslong withdrawal period.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published today in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, provide a new explanation of alcohol’s long-term effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have a new model for the unfortunate cognitive changes that humans with alcohol use disorder show,” said author Patricia Janak, a Johns Hopkins University neuroscientist who studies the biology of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that humans who are addicted to alcohol can show deficits in learning and decision-making that may contribute to their poor decisions related to alcohol use. We needed an animal model to better understand how chronic alcohol abuse affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing what is happening in the brain of an animal when they are having these decision-making difficulties will tell us what is happening in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments led by first author Yifeng Cheng, a research scientist in Janak’s lab who studies alcohol’s effects on the brain, rats recieved very high alcohol exposure for a month. Then after a withdrawal period of nearly three months, the rats were given a reward-based decision-making test along with a control group of rats that had not been exposed to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a reward, rats were given a choice of two levers. Pressing one lever led to a higher likelihood of reward than pressing the other lever. Rats easily learn which lever results in the most reward, so the researchers complicated things by every few minutes switching which lever had the highest reward likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the most reward, a rat should rapidly change its behavior every time it figures out that the reward likelihood has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a difficult task that required memory and strategy. The alcohol-exposed rats performed considerably worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous experiments in animals weren’t comparable to humans with alcohol use disorder because the animals didn’t demonstrate deficits in rapid decision-making. The team believes this was because tasks in earlier experiments were too easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our experiment was quite challenging and the alcohol-exposed rats just couldn’t do it as well,” Janak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the right answer was constantly changing, the control rats made the best decisions faster. They were more strategic. And when we looked at their brains, the control rats’ decision-related neural signals were stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team linked the behavioral difficulties to dramatic functional transformations in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain critical for decision-making. The alcohol had damaged neural circuits causing alcohol-exposed rats to process information less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One surprise was how long alcohol dependence impairs cognition and neural function, even after withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may give us insight into why relapse rates for people addicted to alcohol are so high,” Janak said. “Alcohol-induced neural deficits may contribute to decisions to drink even after going to rehab. We can clearly demonstrate these deficits can be long-lasting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team only found the behavioral and neural impairments only in male rats. The team does not believe this suggests female rats are immune from the effects of alcohol, but that there could be sex-related sensitivities in long-term alcohol effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers next hope to explore how alcoholism affects other areas of the brain that interact with the dorsomedial striatum, and what might be causing the differences between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Robin Magnard, a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins; Angela J. Langdon of the National Institutes of Health; and Daeyeol Lee, a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience and Psychological and Brain Sciences at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AUD and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a504855495f547a50524f145f5e4f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Jill Rosen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jhu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JHU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Jill Rosen – JHU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt0200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic Ethanol Exposure Produces Sex-Dependent Impairments in Value Computations in the Striatum&lt;/a&gt;” by Patricia Janak et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic Ethanol Exposure Produces Sex-Dependent Impairments in Value Computations in the Striatum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value-based decision-making relies on the striatum, where neural plasticity can be altered by chronic ethanol (EtOH) exposure, but the effects of such plasticity on striatal neural dynamics during decision-making remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the long-term impacts of EtOH on reward-driven decision-making and striatal neurocomputations in male and female rats using a dynamic probabilistic reversal learning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a prolonged withdrawal period, EtOH-exposed male rats exhibited deficits in adaptability and exploratory behavior, with aberrant outcome-driven value updating that heightened preference for chosen action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These behavioral changes were linked to altered neural activity in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), where EtOH increased outcome-related encoding and decreased choice-related encoding. In contrast, female rats showed minimal behavioral changes with distinct EtOH-evoked alterations of neural activity, revealing significant sex differences in the impact of chronic EtOH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings underscore the impact of chronic EtOH exposure on adaptive decision-making, revealing enduring changes in neurocomputational processes in the striatum underlying cognitive deficits that differ by sex.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 22:10:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5rVW94c3Bva2FWdWItUE9SdkV2a082VGNnMEw5WUlpWi16QWl5R1hkcFhwcTBkNGtwa2c2dGgzUEd6cGhqY2ptZ1VWNlMyWGdMUjkxSmtfSUZqMUc3YmFxZXV4elhOdw</guid></item><item><title>Shingles is awful, but here’s another reason to get vaccinated: It may fight dementia - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGprSnRzRmw5SFhPQWJmMnRhemRDUHozOXJQVk5GTWVaY1Z2RUpqeHd3T09QeU1IWF9kNzdQRmVJaXpZNDlNaHJmUk8xc2NrRUozRnZCYVZvSUI2TDRiTk1uRGpsZmNVa2tnNkF1d19wTW4yZjh0UXZZd0VIanZJcVRES29zTmhtRlhGeGlaOGpEcExCQWpiTnJIaVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 21:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOMGprSnRzRmw5SFhPQWJmMnRhemRDUHozOXJQVk5GTWVaY1Z2RUpqeHd3T09QeU1IWF9kNzdQRmVJaXpZNDlNaHJmUk8xc2NrRUozRnZCYVZvSUI2TDRiTk1uRGpsZmNVa2tnNkF1d19wTW4yZjh0UXZZd0VIanZJcVRES29zTmhtRlhGeGlaOGpEcExCQWpiTnJIaVk</guid></item><item><title>Two infants die of whooping cough in Louisiana as cases climb nationally - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQb2M1T1pDMkU4NElkcmJlYmd3NGVHNUJ6LUtOOTh3MFREbUI1a0lhUUJWMHotQVRaZHBJVUlKUmVOczFWZGpORnIta2FVaHFRbU1pbXIzX242d1M2QTRnbkZwcXlhZm14X1JFaU9zTlJpc3d2ejlqSXo5cVQxMWJKa25jS0hVaUpId05R0gGCAUFVX3lxTFAydGVvV1hxZUR2cDhZOGhJUnRiNmUtdzktR0RubkI1d3NvZDBDck9HOVMtMUluM2MzSjgxMHI3QjJfU21US3VLRXZRQkdEandXNk1uTkFlN3RDV1VyZmVkV0g1NFQ5cjZtc1doY1BORnFtUmxoczVyX3F6ZG9kMVpnYVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            In his 20 years working in pediatric infectious disease, Dr. John Schieffelin has never seen another illness like pertussis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0zydj00033b6mm39fnp0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also known as whooping cough, it’s a contagious respiratory illness that can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when the person tries to catch their breath. And it’s continuous, even if a person needs to be placed on a ventilator, says Schieffelin, an associate professor of pediatrics at Tulane University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00023b5v425frkte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For infants, it’s really rather terrifying,” he said. “They’re just coughing so much, they can’t eat, they can’t drink, and they often get a pneumonia, which means we have to put them on a ventilator. … They just never stop coughing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00033b5vuigj3u9b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Louisiana, two infants have died of pertussis in the past six months, according to the state health department, the first deaths from the disease in the state since 2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00063b5v5vbeblqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Louisiana has had &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=pfbid033G3FFu4JL9XCG5WW2MtvhgRetMMV8Thf24HQnmsnA62GUKUgL6mA6Pfz2kqoUKD7l&amp;amp;id=61561728868838" target="_blank"&gt;110 cases&lt;/a&gt; of pertussis reported so far this year, the health department said – already approaching the 154 cases reported for all of 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00073b5v0i8bzaag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases are on the rise nationally, too. There were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough last year in the US, the highest number in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;10 people died&lt;/a&gt; — six of them less than 1 year old. Experts say they see peaks and valleys with these kinds of illnesses over the years, but there have been about 6,600 cases already in 2025, almost four times the number at this point last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00083b5v05m3i44z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you start to see these outbreaks … it tends to be as a result of that increased circulation of the microbe in the community, as well as populations with no immunity or reduced immunity that are susceptible to the infection,” said Dr. Lisa Morici, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00053b5v0q61ievj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Concerned about increasing cases, experts are urging vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000b3b5vxn61he1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US had more than 200,000 cases of whooping cough every year before the vaccine was introduced. By &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html#:~:text=Widespread%20use%20of%20the%20vaccine,with%20the%20pre%2Dvaccine%20era." target="_blank"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine was widely used, and infection rates began to drop. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but fell during the Covid-19 pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to measures like masking and distancing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000d3b5vwygqup1p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Children are recommended to get a dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis, or DTaP, vaccine at the ages of 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, between 15 to 18 months and again between 4 to 6 years, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20routine%20DTaP%20vaccination,4%20through%206%20years" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Adolescents should get a booster with a version of the vaccine called Tdap between age 11 and 12, and adults are urged to get Tdap boosters every 10 years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8zsayg500063b6mepzx7bwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Infants too young to be vaccinated are susceptible to the bacteria, which is why officials &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/the-tdap-vaccine-and-pregnancy#:~:text=Tdap%20and%20Pregnancy%20Expand%20All&amp;amp;text=Should%20I%20get%20a%20Tdap,illness%20and%20complications%20of%20pertussis." target="_blank"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women get the vaccine in their third trimester, so the antibodies will be passed to the newborn. This prevents &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/vaccinating-pregnant-patients.html#:~:text=Tdap%20can%20be%20safely%20administered%20at%20any%20point%20during%20pregnancy,during%20a%20community%20pertussis%20outbreak." target="_blank"&gt;78% of pertussis cases&lt;/a&gt; in young infants and is 91% effective against hospitalization, the CDC says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8zsc2dq00093b6m0jo46z2d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another strategy that can protect infants is “cocooning,” in which members of the child’s household all get vaccinated to ensure protection, Schieffelin said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m00093b5v71yg65kl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Boosters are recommended because protection from the vaccine can &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;fade over time&lt;/a&gt;, which may be one reason for the ongoing outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000a3b5v3kve5h7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Declining vaccination rates are another reason. The percentage of US kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt;, leaving thousands vulnerable to infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8zryd8h00003b6mz5dukk9d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Organizers within the state say that although many people have become hesitant about vaccinations, another issue is a lack of access.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8zsakhc00033b6mrs2w41uo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Especially in a state like Louisiana, we’ve got a lot of poverty. We’ve got a lot of rural populations, and not everyone has access to regular medical care,” said Dr. Jennifer Herricks, founder of Louisiana Families for Vaccines, a nonprofit that educates about vaccination. She says this is what makes state services and messaging even more important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000g3b5vk75ibvqk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pertussis cases in Louisiana are rising just weeks after the state Department of Health said it was ending vaccine promotion through events like health fairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000h3b5v6zf1iorv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The State of Louisiana and LDH have historically promoted vaccines for vaccine preventable illnesses through our parish health units, community health fairs, partnerships and media campaigns,” Surgeon General Dr. Ralph Abraham wrote in a memo. “While we encourage each patient to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination with their provider, LDH will no longer promote mass vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8z0ic1m000i3b5vb5noqmno@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The memo differentiated between seasonal vaccines, such as Covid and flu vaccines, usually given at the state’s mass vaccination clinics and routine childhood vaccines, which it called “an important part of providing immunity to our children.” But local officials still expressed concern about the message being sent to residents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “When you cast aspersions or doubt about the safety and efficacy of one vaccine, I think it really has a ripple effect for all vaccines,” said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, director of the New Orleans Health Department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I’ve been encouraged that our state Department of Health is putting out good messaging about pertussis, but I worry that it’s going to get sort of lost in the in the shuffle,” Avegno said. “It’s maybe too little, too late.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        As the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/366512/vast-layoffs-begin-at-hhs.html"&gt;undergoes mass layoffs&lt;/a&gt;, Texas is feeling its own health-related consequences as a result of billions of dollars in federal funding cuts imposed by the Trump administration. One of those consequences: the shuttering of free measles vaccine clinics in one major county, right as the state is dealing with a &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/story/365868/texas-measles-count-almost-as-high-as-us-total-for-2024.html"&gt;continuing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. Per &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-dallas-vaccines-hhs-funding-cuts-rcna199144"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;, dozens of these clinics, which administer free MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccines, have been forced to close their doors in Dallas County, and more than 20 epidemiologists, lab workers, and other staffers tasked with fighting the outbreak have been let go.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        "I just had to tell our commissioners this morning that we've had to cancel over 50 different clinics in our community" over the course of the next year, Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, tells &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/health/dallas-county-cancels-50-community-vaccination-events-doge-cuts-cdc-fda-jobs/3805663/"&gt;NBC Dallas-Fort Worth&lt;/a&gt;. "We had contacted a lot of schools that had lower vaccination rates," he says. "They had contacted us to set up clinics to go to those schools. Well, that's some of what we're having to cancel."

                                        Some $11.4 billion that was slashed nationally was originally earmarked for community health centers during the pandemic—money those centers have since put toward non-COVID-related public health initiatives—but last week, the White House announced it would "no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago."

The Texas Department of State Health Services says that most of the cases have emerged in people who aren't vaccinated, or whose vaccination status isn't clear. The majority of the cases involve children. According to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_10-measles-cases-in-2025"&gt;Friday update&lt;/a&gt;, there are nearly 500 measles cases that have been reported nationally across at least 19 states, though ABC notes this is likely an undercount due to reporting delays.

The authors compared outcomes among 231,899 people with a positive COVID-19 test and 605,014 with a negative COVID-19 test (test-negative control group) from Nov 1, 2021, to Dec 31, 2023. Patient records were examined for a battery of 65 different laboratory tests for infectious illnesses in the 30 days to 12 months following documented COVID-19 illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost 50% higher rate of non-COVID respiratory infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the test-negative control group, participants with a positive COVID-19 test who were not admitted had significantly increased rates of outpatient diagnosis of bacterial, fungal, and viral infectious illnesses (risk ratio [RR], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.19), outpatient respiratory infections (RR, 1.46), and admission to hospital for infectious illnesses (RR, 1.41), including for sepsis and respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those data translate to increased risk of 17%, 46%, and 41%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, non-hospitalized COVID patients had higher rates in 32% of the 65 laboratory-based outcomes compared to those who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rate jumped in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who had higher rates of positive results in 71% of the examined laboratory tests, after accounting for multiple comparisons with the COVID-negative cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COVID may alter immune function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further analyze the association between COVID-19 and subsequent infections, the authors compared people admitted to the hospital for seasonal influenza (3,293) and those admitted for COVID-19 (12,450) in the VA database and found that COVID patients had higher rates of admission to hospital for infectious illnesses (RR, 1.24), admission to hospital for sepsis (RR 1.35), and in-hospital use of antimicrobials (RR, 1.23).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00074-X/fulltext"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In a commentary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the study, Gabriel Chodick, PhD, MHA, from Tel Aviv University, said these findings are important because they show that, even among patients with only moderate infection, COVID-19 seems to alter the immune system and make patients more vulnerable to future illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on long-term immune function and susceptibility to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings have important implications for understanding the potential impact of COVID-19 on long-term immune function and susceptibility to pathogens," Chodick writes. "The evidence suggests effects extending beyond the acute phase of infection, affecting even mild cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Specifically, Stage 3A invasive ductal carcinoma that spread from my right breast to the lymph nodes in my armpit. The news, initially delivered via notification through my hospital’s portal while I was watching an old episode of “Love Island UK,” hit me like a truck. I hit pause on a challenge involving whipped cream and a slip-n-slide to sob into my boyfriend’s chest. I’m only 40. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to be sick. I don’t want to lose the life I’ve been dreaming and working so hard to have.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After I let out every fear in me, I locked in. Cancer became my job. I began to prepare for what was to come, scrolling Reddit for advice from people who had been through it. I got my teeth cleaned, eyebrows tattooed, chopped my waist-length hair into a cute, yet drastic pixie cut, researched financial support organizations to help cover costs, and bought everything I’d need for this weird new life. And I wanted to ensure that as many people with breasts in my communities and beyond could be on higher alert of their possibly traitorous tits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fifteen years ago, my dad died of kidney cancer. In just seven months, a leg pain his doctor ignored took his life. Since his diagnosis I’ve lived under a cloud of paranoia, going to the doctor for any ailment fearing my own diagnosis. And then, it actually happened. The thing that killed my dad wanted to take me too. What a greedy little asshole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I went for my first mammogram and ultrasound last year at 39, where I was informed I have dense breasts ― breast tissue that is more glandular and fibrous than fatty. It wasn’t until I read &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-mammograms-early-detection-screenings.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a piece by Dyan Neary" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67ed7a36e4b0b937ab8f57b3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.thecut.com/article/breast-cancer-mammograms-early-detection-screenings.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;a piece by Dyan Neary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in The Cut that I fully understood how prevalent dense breasts are, the fact that it puts me at greater risk for breast cancer, and what I need to demand medically to ensure I don’t fall through the cracks and die. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As Neary explains, fatty tissue appears on a mammogram as dark gray or black. Cancer tissue, which shows up as white, would stand out against the darkness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, because dense breast tissue also shows up as white, a mass or other cancerous tissue could go undetected. This makes it necessary for those with dense breast tissue, particularly those with family history of breast cancer, to get mammograms, ultrasounds and MRIs performed more regularly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In further research, I learned Latinas like myself and Black women have some of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5916740/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="highest levels of breast density" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67ed7a36e4b0b937ab8f57b3" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5916740/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;highest levels of breast density&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, putting us at even greater risk for breast cancer. Again, no doctor had explained this to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is how I ended up topless in my bathroom making an instructional video on my iPhone and whipping out my boobs for any person with breasts to cop a virtual feel.

I’ve flashed them on girls’ trips, dropped them on friends’ foreheads (consensually) in a move I coined “the titty drop,” and any other time they craved a cool breeze. I gave my treacherous boobs a good, fun-filled life. Now it was time they did something more than produce a laugh and perfect cleavage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was determined to help others one topless DM at a time.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the video and in person, I explained all my symptoms and signs that had me worried: a sharp pain in my breast that often felt like a hot needle poking in, tender achiness, acne-like rashes across my chest I’d never had before, skin on my breast that looked like an orange peel that when pinched was so thick my fingers were unable to meet (this would later be found to be inflammatory breast cancer), and eventually a very large lump. I pinched the thickened, leathery skin and pressed upon my tumor, describing its plum-like feel, and invited them to do the same on me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"In further research, I learned Latinas like myself and Black women have some of the highest levels of breast density, putting us at even greater risk for breast cancer," Zaragoza says. "Again, no doctor had explained this to me."&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Photo courtesy of Alex Zaragoza"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Photo courtesy of Alex Zaragoza&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At a get-together, the hair salon, wherever, I offered my boobs. I’d lift my shirt and explain everything on my breasts, inviting their &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;curious hands to squeeze, pinch, and push around. I could sense their fascination and anxiety as they let out an occasional “whoa, that’s crazy,” shared their own fears, or confessed that they’ve been putting off their exams. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I figured if they can feel and see a breast with cancer that it could help them as they examine their own breasts. They can say, “I remember Alex’s boob had this. Let me call the doctor right now,” and that could possibly save their life. That meant something to me. So much of having cancer is scary and humbling, leaving you at your most vulnerable. But in taking this small bit of control, I could direct the cancer. I’m not completely at its mercy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One acquaintance asked me how to tell the difference between normal lumps or benign cysts and cancerous ones. It seemed like a question with such an obvious answer until I realized we are all navigating with fear, a lack of knowledge, and with hope that maybe that thing we perhaps do feel is nothing. It’s all very scary, and remaining in the dark offers comfort. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I had to tell her we’re not doctors; we’re regular people. Boobs can be lumpy mysteries. We just have to pay attention to our bodies, go to the doctors we trust, who can examine us and give us answers. And, most importantly, we have to advocate for ourselves like our lives depend on it, because they do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The hospital where I was initially getting my mammogram and ultrasound failed to schedule me at the six-month mark after my first exams showed the presence of calcification in my right breast. They couldn’t fit me in until three months after, at the nine-month mark. And when my ultrasound came back abnormal in January of this year, their scheduler said they had no appointments for my MRI and biopsy until late March. I moved all my testing to City of Hope ― the No. 5 cancer hospital in the U.S. whose main campus is, blessedly, 20 minutes from my house.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My boyfriend and I drove an hour-and-a-half multiple times to one of their newer facilities to ensure I could get further tests performed as soon as possible. From there, my treatment has been swift and aggressive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On March 7, I did my first round of chemo, eight days after official diagnosis. My surgeon informed me I was her second patient who had been seen at the other hospital who, because of testing performed later than medically required, discovered their cancer was more advanced than it would have been had we been tested at the six-month mark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think about what that could’ve meant for me as I lose my hair in thick chunks and get such bad diarrhea that I bleed, and pass blood clots that land me in the ER. As I slather myself thick with special creams to avoid my skin getting chemo burn or feeling like sandpaper. As I discover that a nasty UTI is actually the chemo giving me early menopause. As my tongue begins to feel like a fat, dried out sponge and everything tastes bitter. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But then it passes as I get further away from my infusion and I start feeling almost…normal. Then the next round comes and it’s back to square one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I also think about those of us who, compelled by politeness or the brick wall that the health system can be, accept that later appointment time. I think about people who may struggle with language barriers and people with bad insurance or no insurance or the ability to research their very best options. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think about people who don’t have access to a top tier cancer center. People who have so many responsibilities that their health isn’t even a top 10 priority. People who are undocumented and being targeted by this administration. People struggling financially and people who are without a support system that can help them navigate this stressful disease. And I thought about people overwhelmed by the tidal wave of emotion and information that begins to flood you the second the doctor says, “Unfortunately, I have bad news.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even with the cancer of it all, I realize how fortunate I am. I’m humbled every day. My doctors are confident I’m going to beat the cancer. The next two years are going to suck, sure, but this thing already wants me dead. I’m not going to let it kill my stupid, silly spirit. Since sending out my boob videos, I’ve gotten tons of DMs from friends and strangers that they set their mammogram and ultrasound appointments. One person had put it off for 10 years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

                    &lt;p&gt;The measles outbreak that started in Texas in late January continues to grow. As of March 27, 2025, confirmed cases across the United States reached 483, surpassing the total number of confirmed cases recorded in 2024. About 93 percent of the cases are associated with the outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas/2025/03/18/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-spreads-across-3-states-as-case-numbers-swell/"&gt;which now spans Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/whats-behind-the-growing-measles-outbreak-and-how-the-trump-administration-is-responding"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s behind the growing measles outbreak and how the Trump administration is responding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-us-surpasses-case-count-2024"&gt;The vast majority of cases&lt;/a&gt; are in people who are not vaccinated. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/public-health-officials-say-cdc-cuts-misinformation-top-down-hinders-measles-response"&gt;a lack of clarity from health authorities&lt;/a&gt; is leaving people with questions about whether they need to get revaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Q&amp;amp;A with The Conversation U.S., &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vbYSl7sAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Daniel Pastula&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and medical epidemiologist from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Colorado School of Public Health, explained how and when you should take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should adults get another shot of the measles vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine, which first &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lpm.2022.104149"&gt;became available in the U.S. in 1963&lt;/a&gt;, contains a live but significantly weakened strain of the measles virus. This modified strain is too weak to cause measles, but it is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0143"&gt;similar enough to the wild type measles virus&lt;/a&gt; to train the immune system to recognize it. Most people who have received the live measles vaccine won’t need an additional shot now, but here is what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People born before 1957 are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html#cdc_generic_section_2-presumptive-evidence-of-immunity"&gt;presumed to have lifelong immunity&lt;/a&gt; because measles was so contagious that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;almost everyone contracted it before age 15&lt;/a&gt;. Unless there are special circumstances, they probably don’t need a vaccine now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people born after 1957 would have received the shot as children, so they should be set for life. Physicians and public health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;don’t recommend most people in this group get a second measles shot&lt;/a&gt;, though there are exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, a limited outbreak of measles &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.me.43.020192.002315"&gt;occurred among vaccinated school children&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;recommendations changed from one dose&lt;/a&gt; of the live measles vaccine to two doses for children. People fully vaccinated as children after that year &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;do not need any additional doses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_514718" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-514718" class="wp-image-514718 size-full" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5.jpg" alt="When should kids get vaccinated? The CDC recommends: MMR - First dose: 12-15 months old, second dose: 4-6 years old. MMRV - First dose: 12-15 months old, second dose: 4-6 years old (but can also be given 3 months after first dose)" srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5.jpg 1080w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-5-425x531.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-514718" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphic by Steff Staples/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exceptions to these guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two special circumstances where the previous recommendations may not hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, if you were vaccinated between 1963 and 1967, one of the measles vaccines available at the time consisted of just proteins from the virus rather than a live, weakened version of it. Researchers soon realized this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2012.301075"&gt;inactivated, or “killed,” vaccine was less effective&lt;/a&gt; and didn’t provide long-term immunity. Unless you know for certain you received the live vaccine, physicians and public health experts recommend that people vaccinated during those years &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;get one dose of the live vaccine&lt;/a&gt; at some point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if you fall into a high-risk group – for example, if you are a health care provider, are traveling internationally or attending college, physicians and public health experts generally &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;recommend getting a second dose&lt;/a&gt; if you have only had one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_514668" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-514668" class="wp-image-514668 size-full" src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7.jpg" alt='Who should consider getting a booster? The CDC says most people who receive two doses of a measles vaccine following the U.S. vaccination schedule are "protected for life." You might need a booster if you received a measles vaccine before 1968, as that shot was not as effective as the current ones. Talk to your health care provider about what is best for you.' srcset="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7.jpg 1080w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-240x300.jpg 240w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-768x960.jpg 768w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/03/Measles-7-425x531.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-514668" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Graphic by Steff Staples/PBS News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most adults without such risk factors, physicians and public health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html#immunity"&gt;do not routinely recommend a second dose&lt;/a&gt; if you have previously received one dose of a live measles vaccine. If you have questions or concerns about your situation, make sure to ask your health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except in very rare circumstances, there is no recommendation for a third dose of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can you find out whether you’ve been vaccinated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be able to! It’s worth checking. &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/official-guidance/state-policies/state-websites/"&gt;States actually keep vaccine records&lt;/a&gt; specifically for this reason, where you can look up your vaccine records or that of your kids. Your high school or college may still have your records, and so might your pediatrician’s office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should you get your antibody levels checked?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most people, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A titer test &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/antibody-titer"&gt;checks the level of antibodies in your blood&lt;/a&gt;, and some people are asking their doctor to check their titers to determine whether they are still immune to measles. The problem is, the level of antibodies in your blood does not necessarily reflect your level of immunity. That’s because antibodies are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279364/"&gt;just one part of your immune system’s infection-fighting force&lt;/a&gt;. Having a low level of antibodies does not necessarily mean your immunity has waned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other crucial elements of your immune response include &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/t-cells--b-cells-and-the-immune-system.h00-159465579.html"&gt;B cells, T cells and other immune cells&lt;/a&gt;, but a titer test does not show their capabilities. For example, memory B cells might not currently be making antibodies against the virus but are primed to quickly do so the next time they see it. This is why antibody and titer tests should be used only in specific cases, in consultation with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

The CDC recommends locating your vaccination records to see if you have received either the MMR or MMRV vaccine.

&lt;p&gt;One example of when an antibody test may be warranted is if you are a health care provider born before 1957 and you want to make sure you don’t need another dose of the vaccine. You would use a test to see whether you have measles antibodies. But in this case you would be looking for a yes or no answer; the total amount of antibodies may not be very informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is natural immunity better than vaccine-induced immunity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural immunity – that is, the immunity you get after having measles – is effective. However, the downside is that natural infection with a wild virus is very risky. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;Before 1963, measles caused&lt;/a&gt; close to 50,000 hospitalizations and about 500 deaths each year in the United States, usually in children. It also caused over 1,000 cases of severe brain inflammation every year and carried several other long-term risks, such as permanent hearing loss or the wipe out of immunity to other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-to-know-about-highly-contagious-measles-and-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about highly contagious measles and how to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of vaccines is to create immunity without the risks of severe infection. It is basically a dress rehearsal for the real thing. The immunity from a vaccine is effectively the same immunity you get from having measles itself – but vastly safer than encountering the wild virus unprotected. One dose is 93 percent effective at preventing measles and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;two doses are 97 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;, and any breakthrough cases are likely to be much milder than a full-blown case of measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can the vaccine cause measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the measles vaccine cannot cause measles because it contains a significantly weakened strain that has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0143"&gt;limited ability to infect and damage cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some have claimed without evidence that the current &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-anti-vaccine-advocates-blame-shot-rcna193478"&gt;outbreak in Texas was caused by the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/measles-cases-are-rising-in-the-u-s-heres-why-misinformation-about-the-vaccine-persists-today"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Measles cases are rising in the U.S. Here’s why misinformation about the vaccine persists today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the outbreak investigation, however, CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services analyzed the genome of the virus causing the current outbreak and identified it as a wild measles virus. Researchers classify measles virus strains &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/php/laboratories/genetic-analysis.html"&gt;based on their genetic characteristics, or genotypes&lt;/a&gt;. They identified &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812"&gt;the outbreak virus as wild type genotype D8&lt;/a&gt;, and not the weakened measles vaccine strain, which is genotype A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZx28D6I8aI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Measles vaccination has worked so well that many people today have never seen a measles case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the risks of the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a very reasonable question. Because the measles vaccine is a live, weakened virus strain, it can cause a mild, measles-like syndrome. For example, some people might have a slight fever, a rash, or some slight joint pain. These symptoms generally go away in a day or two, and most people don’t experience them. But the vaccine cannot cause measles itself, as it does not contain the wild measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In extremely rare cases, people can experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm"&gt;more significant reactions to the measles vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. It is important to remember that every single medical or health intervention carries risks – and that includes all medications and over-the-counter supplements. According to all available evidence, however, comparing the potential benefits against potential risks reveals that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;the risks of a signficant reaction&lt;/a&gt; to the vaccine are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub4"&gt;much lower than the risks of severe outcomes from measles&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated not only protects you and your family, but it also &lt;a href="https://vaccineknowledge.ox.ac.uk/herd-immunity#How-does-herd-immunity-work"&gt;protects vulnerable people in the community&lt;/a&gt;, such as infants, cancer patients and pregnant women, who cannot be vaccinated themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

Those smoking fentanyl, however, have been able to get them for free, at taxpayers’ expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There was also the time five years ago, when the &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.ktvu.com/news/san-francisco-supervisor-drug-overdose-billboard-sends-wrong-message" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;city helped pay for a billboard&lt;/a&gt; that showed smiling, glittery partygoers. “Do it with friends,” the public service message said, urging drug users to consume with others so they could treat a potential overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For decades, San Francisco has been a liberal city where those using drugs found easy access to their substance of choice and a government generally willing to tolerate addiction. City leaders emphasized a harm reduction approach, believing that more lives would be saved by helping users to consume safely than by punishing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/07/us/daniel-lurie-san-francisco-mayor.html?searchResultPosition=1" title=""&gt;Daniel Lurie&lt;/a&gt;, the moderate Democrat who became the city’s new mayor in January, said this week that things had gone too far. He told The New York Times that he would announce on Wednesday a new policy that walks back the free distribution of clean foil, pipes and plastic straws on the streets of San Francisco. The supplies were typically used to smoke fentanyl or methamphetamines, and the city spent hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Lurie’s rollback was the latest sign that San Francisco was moving away from the far-left ideology that had made it a target of late-night comedians and conservative politicians. In recent years, voters have signaled a political shift by ousting a progressive district attorney and electing more moderate city leaders, including the new mayor and Board of Supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We’ve lost our way,” Mr. Lurie said on Tuesday as he walked around the city’s Tenderloin neighborhood, where fentanyl use and open-air drug markets have proliferated. “We are no longer going to sit by and allow people to kill themselves on the streets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

South Bank University, recently shared the simple things you can change in your lifestyle to prevent a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is disrupted or blocked or when a blood vessel bursts. This restricts the blood and oxygen vital to keep the brain healthy and the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14037607/warning-life-threatening-signs-stroke-easily-missed.html"&gt;damage may become permanent&lt;/a&gt; if enough brain cells die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strokes are the second leading cause of death worldwide and the fifth most common in the US. Nearly 800,000 Americans experience a stroke every year, out of which at least 140,000 people die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stroke risk factors that tend to be more common among older people – such as high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, obesity, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-e2a15870-0fd9-11f0-b9d3-bf1bca50bcae"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, physical inactivity and poor diet – are now increasingly found in younger people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mclernon wrote in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;: 'Adopting these simple lifestyle changes can help to reduce stroke risk and optimize both heart and brain health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the common lifestyle changes Mclernon suggests to prevent a brain stroke:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Stroke association, having high levels of 'bad' cholesterol can increase the risk of stroke by 10 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Avoid smoking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Mclernon, the most important thing to do to improve brain health is to quit smoking cigarettes and vapes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from accelerating brain aging and increasing the risk for dementia, smoking causes damage to blood vessel walls in the brain and reduces overall oxygen levels due to the carbon monoxide in tobacco  - making the body more prone to having a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also causes blood to become sticky, further increasing the risk of blood clots that can block blood vessels and cause a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those who smoke 20 cigarettes every day are six times more likely to have a stroke than people who do not smoke, according to Medical News Today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Maintain blood pressure and stabilize cholesterol &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Siobhan Mclernon, a former neurocritical care nurse has revealed the five things you can do to take care of your brain health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure can put stress on artery walls, which can make them weaker and lead to the accumulation of fat molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause extensive damage in the vessels and pave the way for blood clots to form or break [BREAK WHAT?] them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2020 JAMA &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770254"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that having blood pressure 10-mm Hg higher than a healthy range can increase the risk of strokes caused by blood clots by 20 percent and strokes caused by the bursting of a blood vessel by 31 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nurse wrote in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;: 'If you're over 18 years of age, get your blood pressure checked regularly so, if you do show signs of developing high blood pressure, you can nip it in the bud and make appropriate changes to your lifestyle to help reduce your risk of stroke.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, studies show high levels of LDL ('bad') cholesterol and triglycerides (blood fats) raise the risk of strokes caused by blood clots due to the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Stroke Association, having high levels of 'bad' cholesterol can increase the risk of stroke by 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Mclernon, the most important thing to do to improve brain health is to quit smoking cigarettes and vapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Reduce blood sugar levels &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another key aspect to pay attention to is blood sugar levels in the body, Mclernon suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is a significant risk factor for stroke as it can damage blood vessels, which can lead to blood clots that travel to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, excessive blood glucose can result in increased fatty deposits or clots in blood vessels. These clots can narrow or block blood vessels in the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lecturer noted: 'To reduce blood glucose levels, try to take regular exercise, eat a balanced diet rich in fiber, drink enough water, maintain a healthy weight, and try to manage stress.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People suffering from diabetes are two times more at risk of having a stroke than their healthy counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Maintain a healthy weight and diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being overweight and eating unbalanced meals can significantly amplify risks for having a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Carrying too much weight increases your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes - all of which can damage blood cells, impact oxygen levels and contribute to higher stroke risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with a BMI of 25 or more are classified as overweight, while those with a BMI of 30 or more are defined as obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mclernon says that following a Mediterranean diet can help maintain health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the World Stroke organization, being overweight increases your risk of stroke by 22 percent and if you are obese, that risk increases by 64 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Mclernon says following a Mediterranean diet - a diet that emphasizes plant-based foods and healthy fats including vegetables, fruit, beans, lentils, whole grains, fish, extra virgin olive oil and nuts - can help maintain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'One way to eat a fiber-rich balanced diet and maintain a healthy weight is to follow a Mediterranean diet. This has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke, especially when supplemented with nuts and olive oil.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Exercise and sleep are essential&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, the adult nurse and senior lecturer advised to get seven to nine hours of sleep every night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While not a direct cause, poor sleep and sleep disorders, especially sleep apnea, are linked to an increased risk of stroke, potentially due to inflammation, reduced oxygen levels and blood flow to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of stroke symptoms is four times greater among individuals who slept fewer than six hours a night compared to individuals who reported seven to eight hours of sleep a night, according to researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who analyzed data on 5,666 individuals for three years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Mclernon also warns against excessive sleeping and says: 'Too much sleep, however, is also associated with increased stroke risk, so try to stay as active as possible so you can sleep as well as possible.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also recommends people to exercise more than two days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC recommends US adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week, plus muscle-strengthening exercises at least two days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Exercise should be spread evenly over four to five days a week, or every day. Do strengthening activities, usually more than two days per week,' the nurse noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Her death marks the state's first documented human fatality from bird flu and the second in India — after a case in Haryana in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl was admitted to AIIMS-Mangalagiri with symptoms of bird flu on March 4 and died on March 16. The case came to light on Wednesday after officials reconfirmed her swab test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) in Guntur identified the presence of H5N1 in her samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;How informed do you feel about the risks of bird flu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state govt declared a state of high alert, directing all district medical and health officers to conduct fever screenings in vulnerable areas. "We are also looking for people with unusual symptoms," said principal secretary (health) MT Krishna Babu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, officials assured the public there was no cause for alarm, saying the death was linked to having raw chicken rather than human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The girl's parents said they had fed her a small piece of raw chicken on Feb 28, something they had done on previous occasions without issue. However, this time she developed severe health complications, including breathlessness and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child's father works as a loan recovery agent at a private bank, while her mother is a homemaker. The parents first took the girl to a local hospital before transferring her to AIIMS as her condition worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors collected nasal swab samples on March 7, confirming influenza A at the hospital's VRDL. Further testing at Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) lab in New Delhi identified the H5N1 virus, with NIV Pune reconfirming the results before the girl's death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other family members who ate the cooked chicken remain healthy. Health officials collected nasal swab samples from the family and others who had purchased chicken from the same meat shop. All initial tests came back negative. "We have once again collected nasal swab samples from the family members and sent them to VRDL for analysis," a senior health official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal husbandry director Dr T Damodar Naidu advised people to eat chicken and eggs only after cooking them thoroughly, "as the bird flu virus cannot survive at temperatures above 60 to 70 degrees Celsius".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials ruled out further spread, saying H5N1 has a short incubation period of three to four days. "As the girl died 18 days ago and no additional cases have been detected, there is no possibility of transmission," a health official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIIMS-Mangalagiri described it as a "sporadic case" rather than an outbreak and doctors said no new human infections had been reported since March 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has sparked concern across the state, particularly after the animal husbandry department recently declared Andhra Pradesh free from bird flu, citing no recorded mortality in commercial poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following the child's death, we conducted physical surveillance at all poultry farms and backyard poultry in Guntur, Palnadu, Prakasam district, and Narasaraopet town. No traces of bird flu were found in poultry," said animal husbandry director Naidu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 19:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Child with measles confirmed in Snohomish County, 2 clinics exposed - KOMO</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgJBVV95cUxOclI0NUhVU2oxLTJ3c0dqZnlTTXFQRkphV2hLTXlDNXB0RWZqa0RST1FwQnc1eTFIcWFFcXNYQ3VMWXNKNW5IME1hdDltWEZjakhkdnpmMy1uRFFBX0xLMHYwRy1CY2IwYlIxQWNselRMVzdRejB5YlNJUktqSk9XTDRvSi1yT3FkRlJaYUsyVFNPcTZxYW5mQnhTYk83QWE1Xzl5Q3BUNTJwRTFueHNhQy1BU2djV0s5OTV4WW1MaUFWcHB0Mjl1TWxOLThqaDBpRGFOa3JmZlFUUXB5c0JCUDRkWmdmenJ5Z2VlelVrNHlQMDN6dUJhRGZyREFQZ1U4dzJvSEZUU0ItMkxzc2JrdzBocEJ5dlFjMndlQ09ISWxZVl9fVkliOE1kblBSdS1NdWoxVUhnbHYxVDYzT0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SNOHOMISH COUNTY, Wash. — &lt;/span&gt;Providence Medical Group Northwest has confirmed that a pediatric patient with measles visited two of its clinics in Snohomish County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child was seen at the PMG Monroe Walk-in Clinic on Saturday, March 29, and again at the PMG Mill Creek Walk-in Clinic on Monday, March 31. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/measles-case-in-washington-raises-outbreak-fears-amid-declining-vaccination-rates-vaxx-immunity-herd-children-baby-toddler-sick-doctor-hospital-pediatrician-outbreak-pandemic-vitamin-a-cough-sneeze-fever-rash" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/local/measles-case-in-washington-raises-outbreak-fears-amid-declining-vaccination-rates-vaxx-immunity-herd-children-baby-toddler-sick-doctor-hospital-pediatrician-outbreak-pandemic-vitamin-a-cough-sneeze-fever-rash" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Measles case in Washington raises outbreak fears as vaccination rates decline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child and their family were later sent to Seattle Children’s for further testing, which confirmed the measles diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During both clinic visits, PMG staff followed thorough screening measures for the symptoms present and followed measles precautions and protocols to ensure the health and safety of our patients, their family members and our caregivers," said Providence Medical Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providence Swedish urges anyone who visited these clinics during these exposure periods to seek medical advice and monitor for symptoms for 14 days following possible exposure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PMG Monroe Walk-in Clinic – Saturday, March 29, from 6:25 –10 p.m. Exposed individuals should monitor for symptoms April 5-19.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;PMG Mill Creek Walk-in Clinic – Monday, March 31, from 8:55 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. Exposed individuals should monitor for symptoms April 7-21.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease, causing fever, rash, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes. If one person contracts measles, up to nine out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not protected with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. The disease mainly spreads through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People infected with measles are contagious four days before the rash starts through four days after the rash appears. The incubation period for measles from exposure to fever is usually about seven to 10 days, and from exposure to rash onset is usually about 10-14 days (with a range of seven to 21 days.) People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. Measles can lead to ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, and in rare cases, encephalitis (brain inflammation) or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy people can experience complications from measles, but those at highest risk include infants and children under five years, adults over 20 years, pregnant people, and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination offers safe, effective measles protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles, Providence Swedish strongly recommends everyone receive the safe and highly effective MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), two doses of the MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles and providing long-lasting protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information can be found on the Snohomish County Health Department's &lt;a href="https://www.snohd.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=841" target="_blank" title="https://www.snohd.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=841" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;WEBSITE. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 19:02:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgJBVV95cUxOclI0NUhVU2oxLTJ3c0dqZnlTTXFQRkphV2hLTXlDNXB0RWZqa0RST1FwQnc1eTFIcWFFcXNYQ3VMWXNKNW5IME1hdDltWEZjakhkdnpmMy1uRFFBX0xLMHYwRy1CY2IwYlIxQWNselRMVzdRejB5YlNJUktqSk9XTDRvSi1yT3FkRlJaYUsyVFNPcTZxYW5mQnhTYk83QWE1Xzl5Q3BUNTJwRTFueHNhQy1BU2djV0s5OTV4WW1MaUFWcHB0Mjl1TWxOLThqaDBpRGFOa3JmZlFUUXB5c0JCUDRkWmdmenJ5Z2VlelVrNHlQMDN6dUJhRGZyREFQZ1U4dzJvSEZUU0ItMkxzc2JrdzBocEJ5dlFjMndlQ09ISWxZVl9fVkliOE1kblBSdS1NdWoxVUhnbHYxVDYzT0E</guid></item><item><title>Chart shows how measles is spreading exponentially in the US - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPVUdETmFOUG5tQ3RYOHR2eG14Umpia2JZMW5SdFBLckJOMGYzOHNucXN2ZEJBSEZwa20yc1RNWnpaRDV2R2JuV0ZzWUhxM1F4b2xmQXZlb19vMjBkVEFtWjdYZGNJcVJSSHpYLTQ4bzJZblVUcUs2QWJEeXZCYUpqaVNrMmc1bmtj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-body-content post-story-body-content" data-component-type="post-body-content" data-load-strategy="exclude" data-track-content="" data-post-type="story"&gt;

A new study has found that linoleic acid, a type of fat found in eggs and soybeans and common in Western diets, can activate a key growth pathway in triple-negative &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/lifechanging-discovery-reduces-breast-cancer-recurrence/"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most difficult forms to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="how_cancer_growth_is_tied_to_nutrients"&gt;How cancer growth is tied to nutrients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All cells, including cancer cells, need to match their growth with available nutrients. A major player in this balancing act is a cellular signaling network called mTORC1. It acts like a sensor and regulator, helping cells grow when nutrients are available. This pathway is especially important in cancer biology, where abnormal growth is a hallmark. In breast cancer, mTORC1 signaling is disrupted in nearly half of all cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, researchers have focused mostly on how &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/eating-less-of-these-amino-acids-increases-lifespan-by-33-study-finds/"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; and glucose affect this pathway. But other nutrients, like essential fatty acids, haven’t been as deeply studied—especially when it comes to their direct effect on cancer cell behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Linoleic acid, found in seed oils like safflower and soybean oil as well as in animal products such as pork and eggs, can activate the mTORC1 pathway.

Your body can’t make these on its own. You get them from food. &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/high-levels-of-omega-3-omega-6-could-decrease-cancer-risk/"&gt;Omega-6 fats&lt;/a&gt; help make compounds that drive inflammation. Omega-3s, on the other hand, tend to have calming, anti-inflammatory effects. Yet until now, researchers hadn’t clearly shown how omega-6 fats might trigger cancer growth at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="linoleic_acid_fuels_a_specific_cancer_subtype"&gt;Linoleic acid fuels a specific cancer subtype&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings, published in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adm9805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, focus on triple-negative breast cancer. This form lacks three key receptors—estrogen, progesterone, and HER2—that are usually targeted in treatment. Because of this, triple-negative tumors are harder to treat and more aggressive than other types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that linoleic acid, found in seed oils like safflower and soybean oil as well as in animal products such as pork and eggs, can activate the mTORC1 pathway—but only in triple-negative breast cancer cells. The secret lies in a protein called FABP5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FABP5 acts as a fatty acid transporter. In triple-negative tumors, cells make high amounts of this protein. The researchers found that linoleic acid binds to FABP5. This binding sets off a chain reaction, ultimately flipping the “on” switch for the mTORC1 pathway. As a result, the tumor cells grow faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way,” said study senior author Dr. John Blenis, the Anna-Maria and Stephen Kellen Professor of Cancer Research in the Department of Pharmacology and a member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at &lt;a href="https://weill.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weill Cornell Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. “This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalized manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_closer_look_at_the_mouse_model_and_real_patients"&gt;A closer look at the mouse model and real patients&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team tested their findings in mice with triple-negative breast cancer. When fed a high-linoleic-acid diet, these mice showed more tumor growth. They also had more FABP5 in their tumors and higher activation of mTORC1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;A mechanism is revealed through which ω-6 LA—the most abundant polyunsaturated fat in Western diets—activates mTORC1, the main regulator of cell growth.

The same pattern appeared: high levels of linoleic acid and FABP5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results strongly suggest that linoleic acid can promote &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/experimental-cancer-drug-eliminates-breast-cancer-bone-metastasis/"&gt;cancer growth&lt;/a&gt; in this subtype—and that FABP5 is the link. This is the first time a clear biological mechanism has been shown connecting linoleic acid from food to cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nikos Koundouros, the study’s first author, believes this discovery could have broader implications. “There may be a broader role for FABP5-mTORC1 signaling in other cancer types and even in common chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found early signs that the same fatty acid-FABP5 interaction might help fuel some types of prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Mammosphere formation efficiency of 1 × 103 HCC1806 and MCF7 single cells cultured for 12 days with 30 μM ω-6 LA or ω-3 ALA. n = 3 replicate wells. n.s., not significant; *P ≤ 0.05; determined by one-way ANOVA followed by two-tailed Student’s t test with Bonferroni correction.

Since the 1950s, as seed oil use has surged, so has linoleic acid consumption. Some experts have long questioned whether this trend might be linked to rising cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of studies have tried to answer whether &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/walnuts-for-breakfast-the-natural-brain-boost-you-need/"&gt;omega-6 fats&lt;/a&gt; like linoleic acid cause cancer. But the results have been mixed and inconclusive. The problem was that most studies looked only at general patterns, not the biological reasons behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research changes that. By finding a direct mechanism—one that only applies to a certain cancer subtype—it brings clarity. It shows that diet and disease might be more connected than we thought, but only under specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triple-negative breast cancer makes up about 10-15% of all breast cancer cases. It tends to affect younger people and has fewer treatment options.

If a patient’s tumor has high levels of FABP5, cutting back on foods rich in linoleic acid might help slow the cancer’s growth. This approach wouldn’t replace treatment, but it could support it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FABP5 might also become a useful biomarker.

For years, health experts debated whether omega-6 fats were harmful.

While many participants experienced mood improvements after taking antidepressants for eight weeks, their cognitive abilities did not improve to the same degree. These findings highlight an important gap in current depression treatment: antidepressants can help with emotional symptoms but may not fully address problems with memory, attention, and mental speed, at least after two months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is not just about feeling sad. It often comes with difficulties in thinking clearly, remembering things, or staying focused. These mental challenges—sometimes described as “brain fog”—can interfere with daily functioning, even when mood symptoms begin to lift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past studies have shown that people with depression tend to perform worse than others on tests of memory, attention, and mental flexibility. However, most of those studies included people who had other medical or psychiatric conditions, or who were already taking medications that could influence thinking. The current study aimed to isolate the effects of depression itself by focusing on people who were otherwise healthy and unmedicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to better understand what specific cognitive functions are impaired in major depressive disorder and whether current antidepressant treatments address these deficits,” said study author Gwyneth W.Y Wu, a research scientist at the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying potential treatment gaps, we hope to contribute to more comprehensive and targeted therapeutic strategies. Additionally, most studies comparing cognitive impairments in individuals with depression to controls do not specifically focus on medically healthy, unmedicated individuals. Our study aimed to identify cognitive performance specifically associated with depression, rather than medication or other underlying illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers recruited 113 adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 88 adults without depression to serve as a comparison group. Everyone in the study was physically healthy and free of other psychiatric conditions, such as substance use disorders, bipolar disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. None of the participants were taking medications known to affect brain function including antidepressant, anti-anxiety, or mood stabilizing medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression diagnoses were confirmed through structured interviews, and participants completed a series of well-known cognitive tests that measured areas like processing speed, executive function, and both visual and verbal memory. These tests were given to everyone at the start of the study. A subgroup of 69 people with depression went on to complete eight weeks of treatment with a commonly prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs). At the end of those eight weeks, they repeated the cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study, people with depression performed worse than those without depression on several key measures. They scored significantly lower on a test called the Symbol Digit Modalities Test, which measures how quickly someone can process information and match symbols to numbers. They also struggled more on parts of the Stroop Test, which assesses how well someone can focus attention and ignore distracting information, as well as on the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test, which measures how well people can remember visual patterns. Interestingly, differences between the groups were not seen on all tasks—especially those involving verbal memory or simpler forms of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether some people were more severely impaired than others. They defined clinical impairment as scoring more than 1.5 standard deviations below the population average. Compared to the healthy group, a larger portion of depressed participants showed this level of impairment in processing speed and visual memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reinforce existing research, highlighting the link between cognitive deficits and major depressive disorder,” Wu told PsyPost. “We identified impairments in processing speed, visuospatial memory, and learning in unmedicated individuals with major depression. Additionally, we observed higher rates of clinical impairment in processing speed and both verbal and visual learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings of impaired processing speed and visuospatial memory—without significant deficits in verbal memory or executive functioning—suggest that these cognitive abnormalities may be linked to dysfunction in specific structural or functional brain regions, but this requires further study. This highlights the possibility that depression-related cognitive impairment may affect certain domains more than others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks of antidepressant treatment, the researchers reassessed cognitive function among the 69 treated participants. On the surface, the results seemed encouraging: people performed better on six of the thirteen cognitive tests, including measures of processing speed and visual memory. However, when the researchers dug deeper, they found that these improvements were not clearly linked to whether or not someone responded to antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, only one test—the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, which assesses verbal memory—showed a meaningful difference between people whose depression symptoms improved and those whose symptoms did not. On that test, those who responded to medication showed improved verbal learning over time, while non-responders actually did slightly worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While participants generally showed improved cognitive performance over the 8-week period, antidepressant response to SSRI treatment was not associated with cognitive gains,” Wu explained. “This underscores the need to consider cognition as an independent therapeutic target in the treatment of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested whether baseline cognitive scores could predict who would respond to antidepressants. They found no differences in initial cognitive performance between those who later responded to medication and those who did not. This means that measuring cognitive ability at the start of treatment was not helpful in predicting which patients would benefit from medication. Although earlier studies have suggested that slower thinking or poor memory might signal a lower chance of improvement, this study—using a carefully selected sample—did not support that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all research, this study had limitations. The sample size was relatively large for this type of study, but it may still have been too small to detect subtle differences between responders and non-responders. The study also excluded people with other medical or psychiatric conditions, so the results may not apply to all patients with depression, especially those with more complex health profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study features a well-screened, relatively large cohort of unmedicated, physically healthy adults with major depressive disorder, free from substance use disorder or other comorbidities, along with a matched, never-depressed healthy control group,” Wu noted. “While these strict exclusion criteria strengthen the internal validity of our findings, they may limit the generalizability to broader populations, particularly those with comorbid physical or psychiatric conditions or those receiving pharmacological treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that different aspects of depression improve on different timelines, and that cognitive symptoms might take longer to respond to treatment. “It would be nice to retest after four or six months, in addition to the two months we did,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the strengths of the study are notable. It is one of the few to examine cognitive function in unmedicated individuals with depression who are otherwise healthy. The researchers used a well-rounded set of cognitive tests and tracked changes over time, allowing them to compare baseline differences and treatment effects. They also confirmed that participants took their medication as prescribed by measuring drug levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope their work can inform more targeted treatments in the future. Long-term, they aim to develop strategies that address both the emotional and cognitive symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While traditional depression treatments focus on alleviating mood symptoms, cognitive deficits often persist even after mood improvement,” Wu explained. “This dissociation between cognitive and depressive outcomes could have important clinical implications as even patients who respond symptomatically to SSRI treatment may still suffer from unaddressed cognitive deficits. Addressing this unmet need could lead to more comprehensive and functional patient outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression research is critical to advancing our understanding of this complex and pervasive condition. By exploring both the emotional and cognitive dimensions of depression, we can develop more effective and personalized treatments. Ongoing research not only improves clinical outcomes but also paves the way for innovative therapies that can enhance patients’ quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.02.115" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cognitive function in physically healthy, unmedicated individuals with major depression: Relationship with depressive symptoms and antidepressant response&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Anna Ou, Gwyneth W.Y Wu, Michelle T.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers demonstrate in an animal how heavy alcohol use leads to long-term behavioral issues by damaging brain circuits critical for decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Rats exposed to high amounts of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; exhibited poor &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/decision-making/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;decision-making&lt;/a&gt; during a complex task, even after a months-long withdrawal period. Key areas of their brains had undergone dramatic functional changes compared to healthy &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rats/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, provide a new explanation of alcohol's long-term effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We now have a new model for the unfortunate cognitive changes that humans with alcohol-use disorder show," said author Patricia Janak, a Johns Hopkins University neuroscientist who studies the biology of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that humans who are addicted to alcohol can show deficits in learning and decision-making that may contribute to their poor decisions related to alcohol use. We needed an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/animal+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;animal model&lt;/a&gt; to better understand how chronic alcohol abuse affects the brain. Knowing what is happening in the brain of an animal when they are having these decision-making difficulties will tell us what is happening in humans."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments led by first author Yifeng Cheng, a research scientist in Janak's lab who studies alcohol's effects on the brain, rats received very high alcohol exposure for a month. Then, after a withdrawal period of nearly three months, the rats were given a reward-based decision-making test along with a control group of rats that had not been exposed to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;To get a reward, rats were given a choice of two levers. Pressing one lever led to a higher likelihood of reward than pressing the other lever. Rats easily learn which lever results in the most reward, so the researchers complicated things by every few minutes switching which lever had the highest reward likelihood. To get the most reward, a rat should rapidly change its behavior every time it figures out that the reward likelihood has changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a difficult task that required memory and strategy. The alcohol-exposed rats performed considerably worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous experiments in animals weren't comparable to humans with alcohol use disorder because the animals didn't demonstrate deficits in rapid decision-making. The team believes this was because tasks in earlier experiments were too easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our experiment was quite challenging and the alcohol-exposed rats just couldn't do it as well," Janak said. "When the right answer was constantly changing, the control rats made the best decisions faster. They were more strategic. And when we looked at their brains, the control rats' decision-related neural signals were stronger."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team linked the behavioral difficulties to dramatic functional transformations in the dorsomedial striatum, a part of the brain critical for decision-making. The alcohol had damaged &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+circuits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural circuits&lt;/a&gt;, causing alcohol-exposed rats to process information less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;One surprise was how long alcohol dependence impairs cognition and neural function, even after withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This may give us insight into why relapse rates for people addicted to alcohol are so high," Janak said. "Alcohol-induced neural deficits may contribute to decisions to drink even after going to rehab. We can clearly demonstrate these deficits can be long-lasting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team only found the behavioral and neural impairments only in male rats. The team does not believe this suggests female rats are immune to the effects of alcohol, but that there could be sex-related sensitivities in long-term alcohol effects on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers next hope to explore how alcoholism affects other areas of the brain that interact with the dorsomedial striatum, and what might be causing the differences between males and females.&lt;/p&gt;

A recent surge in cases of the bacterial infection, usually spread by sexual contact, has alarmed her and other physicians across Hampton Roads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As cases have climbed in all demographics locally and across Virginia and the country — even in newborns and seniors — a regional collaboration called the Stop Syphilis Coalition is launching a public awareness campaign this month to educate residents and providers on risk factors, symptoms and screening recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our region has some of the highest rates of syphilis in Virginia,” Girois said. “This needs to be at the top of people’s minds, because it can be such a devastating and even deadly infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-aGsPBxFR" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_aGsPBxFR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by the Virginia Department of Health and the M.

(Kendall Warner / The Virginian-Pilot)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top goals include promoting screening for all pregnant women — who can pass an infection to their baby, increasing conversations between physicians and patients on prevention and testing options, expanding screening in emergency rooms and outpatient settings, and strengthening data tracking and contact tracing methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of pregnancy, current federal health guidelines call for screening at-risk, sexually-active teenagers and adults, especially if they are between the ages of 15 and 44 and live in areas with high rates of syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have multiple sexual partners, gay or bisexual men, and patients with HIV or another sexually-transmitted infection are among the groups in high-risk categories; having unprotected oral, vaginal or anal sex further raises the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left untreated, syphilis can lead to serious and even life-threatening damage to the brain, spinal cord, heart, liver, blood vessels, joints, eyes and ears. An infection in unborn babies, known as congenital syphilis, also increases the odds of premature birth and stillbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older patients, syphilis typically starts as a single sore on the genitals, rectum or mouth that is firm yet painless. The infection spreads mainly through direct contact with those lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The word ‘sore’ is misleading, unfortunately, as these lesions generally don’t hurt,” said Dr. Charles Frazier, senior vice president and chief medical information and innovation officer at Riverside Health System. “People might ignore them or not even be aware of them, but they need to get checked as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that syphilis is 100% treatable with penicillin. Most adult patients are cured with just one injection of the antibiotic; others may need two or three if the disease has progressed to a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have had unprotected sex with an infected partner, or who don’t know a partner’s history, also may be candidates for doxycycline, an antibiotic that can be taken as a “morning after” treatment to potentially stop syphilis from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most newborns with congenital syphilis, however, must spend 10 days on intravenous penicillin in intensive care. Without quick treatment, complications can include rashes, fever, anemia, bone changes, developmental delays, swelling in the spleen and liver and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every case of congenital syphilis is a preventable tragedy,” Girois noted. “Our message is that if you’re pregnant, please, please seek prenatal care.” Obstetricians generally screen expectant mothers at their first appointment and again at 28 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syphilis cases have been climbing steadily in Virginia in recent years, with Hampton Roads a frequent hot spot — particularly for congenital syphilis. In 2024, the Eastern Virginia Health Region accounted for 15 of the state’s 36 congenital cases, according to VDH data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials aren’t sure what’s behind the rise, although a higher number of infected patients naturally leads to more widespread transmission. Girois also theorizes that the intense fear of STIs that drove safe sex practices at the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has subsided as fewer patients die of that infection; more adults, meanwhile, are continuing to date into their senior years, when they don’t need protection to prevent pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syphilis is a complex infection with four stages. Most patients first develop a lesion about three weeks after infection. Next, they may experience a rash that can start on the trunk of the body and spread to the limbs, palms of the hands or soles of the feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untreated patients then enter a “latent” phase, when bacteria remain in their bodies but may not cause symptoms for months or years. Those who progress to a final stage, tertiary syphilis, can face dementia, paralysis, balance problems, heart failure and vision and/or hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stop Syphilis Coalition plans to conduct a widespread print and social media education campaign and provide fact sheets to community-based providers and organizations who encounter at-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members also are discussing changing strategies within health care systems. Riverside, for example, has built educational links on syphilis into its electronic medical records system, easily accessed by its community-based providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_7515399" class="wp-caption alignright size-article_inline_third"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.dailypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-120431.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Dr. Lawrence Leslie, deputy medical director for the Emergency Department at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.

(Courtesy of Sentara Health)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Sentara, emergency department leaders are developing stronger protocols to ensure prompt screening of at-risk patients such as those with HIV, gonorrhea and/or chlamydia, all STIs. That could involve offering more onsite tests along with referrals to outpatient providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to develop the most streamlined pathway to get people into the right setting for education, follow-up testing and treatment,” said Dr. Lawrence Leslie, deputy medical director for the Emergency Department at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital. “Hopefully this is an area where we can make an immediate impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, screening soon could become easier with new rapid blood tests, which can deliver results about 15 minutes after a finger prick. Previously, samples have gone to a laboratory with about a two-day turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to treat people before they walk out the door would be a gamechanger,” Girois said. “It’s time for us to be much more systematic about offering testing. It’s time for a full-court press.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For information, data and resources on syphilis for both the general public and medical providers, visit &lt;a href="http://vdh.virginia.gov/norfolk/syphilis-resources" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vdh.virginia.gov/norfolk/syphilis-resources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://vdh.virginia.gov/syphilis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vdh.virginia.gov/syphilis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alison Johnson, ajohnsondp@yahoo.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

There are more snack products, especially in the high-protein category, than ever before. While variety is good, it can be exhausting navigating the nutrition information and front-of-package claims. For that reason, I’m always happy to share my favorite snacks, especially from my favorite stores, like Trader Joe’s. I love their bags of nuts and cans of tuna, but if I’m looking for a satisfying high-protein snack, I always grab their Mediterranean Style Hummus Snack Pack with Pita Chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me and always hungry, it’s nice to have a portable snack that you can carry with you when you’re on the move. I’ve enjoyed hummus as a snack for years, but it never made sense to carry a container of it in my lunch or snack bag. I portion it into little jars when I have time, but more often than not, I’m grabbing my snack as I’m running out the door. That’s why I love the convenience of Trader Joe’s pre-portioned packages of hummus and pita chips, which are perfectly sized and satisfying. The crunchy pita chips are a great way to scoop and enjoy every bite of that protein-packed hummus!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Protein in Snacks Works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All nutrients are important and necessary for fueling your body and keeping it healthy. That’s why consuming a variety of foods is essential. But when it comes to snacking, I always recommend something with protein. Protein prompts the release of certain hormones, like cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and decreases the release of others, like ghrelin, to help slow digestion and reduce appetite. This means that a snack with protein is usually more satisfying than one without. The hummus and pita chips snack pack from Trader Joe’s has 9 grams of protein, thanks to the combination of pita chips and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913550/are-chickpeas-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:garbanzo beans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;garbanzo beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/protein-you-should-be-eating-more-of-on-the-mediterranean-diet-8789966" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Protein You Should Be Eating More Of on the Mediterranean Diet, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The #1 Protein You Should Be Eating More Of on the Mediterranean Diet, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Protein Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is one of three macronutrients (carbohydrates and fat are the other two) essential for providing energy. It’s made up of amino acids, which are the “building blocks” responsible for and involved in almost every function in our bodies, from growing and repairing muscle and bone to transporting nutrients. Protein is found in a variety of foods, including both animals and plants. The amount of protein your body needs depends on age, gender, activity level and health. The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults 19 and older consume 10% to 35% of their daily calories from protein. For frame of reference, that’s about 200 to 700 calories from protein for a 2,000-calorie diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Much Protein Do You Need to Eat Every Day?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;How Much Protein Do You Need to Eat Every Day?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Makes Something a Good High-Protein Snack?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of ways to build a high-protein snack. Fortunately many of them are nourishing and delicious. Direct food sources of protein are easy and straight-forward. You can start with thinking of the food groups. Dairy, eggs, meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, tofu, beans and lentils are all sources of protein. If your diet allows it, choose something from those categories, since a serving provides anywhere from 7 grams to upward of 25 grams of protein, with meat and seafood supplying the most for a 3-ounce portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a bar or other prepared snack is your preference, you’ll have to do a bit of reading before you buy. Many snacks, especially protein bars and granola bars, are high in added sugar and refined grains. To find a good snack, start with the Nutrition Facts panel, and look at the protein and added sugar. Go for a snack or bar with at least 7 grams of protein and less than 8 grams of added sugar. Next, review the ingredient list and opt for something made with whole grains versus refined grains—you’ll get more nutrients like fiber and B vitamins. And if you’re sensitive to artificial sweeteners, artificial flavors and preservatives, review the ingredient list for those and choose accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291961/10-high-protein-snacks-that-keep-you-feeling-full-longer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:15 High-Protein Snacks That Keep You Feeling Full Longer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;15 High-Protein Snacks That Keep You Feeling Full Longer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for When to Have a High-Protein Snack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best time to enjoy a high-protein snack is between meals, before you get too ravenous. Usually a few hours after a meal is a good rule of thumb, but also listen to your body. If your meal was small or maybe didn’t provide enough nutrition, you may need something earlier. Or if your meal was large or something high in fiber and protein, you can wait a bit longer. Remember that a snack is smaller than a meal and should be satisfying enough to help get you to your next meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of us enjoy snacks between meals, they can also be a crucial step in recovery after exercise, says cookbook author and sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://danawhitenutrition.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dana Angelo White, M.S., RDN, ATC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dana Angelo White, M.S., RDN, ATC&lt;/a&gt;. She adds that a “balanced snack always benefits from some protein to help keep you feeling satisfied and energized.” Hummus, like my favorite from Trader Joe’s, is a great option, but White also recommends snacks like smoothies, yogurt bowls made with plain Greek yogurt, or a meat or peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which “are easy and effective foods that offer up protein and deliciousness—both are important!” But remember, says White,“It’s best to spread out protein intake throughout the day. Making sure most meals and snacks have a sensible amount of protein makes the task a lot easier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/easy-snack-recipes-with-more-protein-than-an-egg-11695136" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20 Easy Snack Recipes with More Protein Than An Egg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;20 Easy Snack Recipes with More Protein Than An Egg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to a snack that satisfies, choose something with a bit of protein.

        &lt;p&gt;“It was a really striking finding,” Geldsetzer said. “This huge protective signal was there, any which way you looked at the data.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The scientists searched high and low for other variables that might have influenced dementia risk but found the two groups to be indistinguishable in all characteristics. There was no difference in the level of education between the people who were eligible and ineligible, for example. Those who were eligible were not more likely to get other vaccinations or preventive treatments, nor were they less likely to be diagnosed with other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The only difference was the drop in dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;“Because of the unique way in which the vaccine was rolled out, bias in the analysis is much less likely than would usually be the case,” Geldsetzer said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, his team analyzed the data in alternate ways — using different age ranges or looking only at deaths attributed to dementia, for example — but the link between vaccination and lower dementia rates remained.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;“The signal in our data was so strong, so clear and so persistent,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Stronger response in women&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;In a further finding, the study showed that protection against dementia was much more pronounced in women than in men. This could be due to sex differences in immune response or in the way dementia develops, Geldsetzer said. Women on average have higher antibody responses to vaccination, for example, and shingles is more common in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Whether the vaccine protects against dementia by revving up the immune system overall, by specifically reducing reactivations of the virus or by some other mechanism is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Also unknown is whether a newer version of the vaccine, which contains only certain proteins from the virus and is more effective at preventing shingles, may have a similar or even greater impact on dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Geldsetzer hopes the new findings will inspire more funding for this line of research.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;“At least investing a subset of our resources into investigating these pathways could lead to breakthroughs in terms of treatment and prevention,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;In the past two years, his team has replicated the Wales findings in health records from other countries, including England, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, that had similar rollouts of the vaccine. “We just keep seeing this strong protective signal for dementia in dataset after dataset,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;But Geldsetzer has set his sights on a large, randomized controlled trial, which would provide the strongest proof of cause and effect. Participants would be randomly assigned to receive the live-attenuated vaccine or a placebo shot.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;“It would be a very simple, pragmatic trial because we have a one-off intervention that we know is safe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Geldsetzer is seeking philanthropic funding for the trial as the live-attenuated vaccine is no longer manufactured by pharmaceutical companies.  &lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;And such a trial might not take long to see results. He pointed to a graph of the Wales data tracking the dementia rates of those who were eligible and ineligible for the vaccine. The two curves began to separate in about a year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;A researcher from the Vienna University of Economics and Business also contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The study received funding from The Phil &amp;amp; Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience, the National Institute on Aging (grant R01AG084535), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant DP2AI171011), and Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, Americans &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html"&gt;50 and older&lt;/a&gt; are urged to get a newer vaccine that's proven more effective against shingles than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The new findings add another reason for people to consider rolling up their sleeves, said Dr. Maria Nagel of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, who studies viruses that infiltrate the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The virus “is a risk for dementia and now we have an intervention that can decrease the risk,” Nagel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;With Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia on the rise in an aging population, “the implications of the study are profound,” Dr. Anupam Jena, a Harvard physician and health economist, wrote in a Nature commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Anyone who’s had ever had chickenpox – nearly everybody born before 1980 – harbors that virus for the rest of their life. It hides in nerves and can break out when the immune system weakens from illness or age, causing painful, blister-like sores typically on one side of the body that last for weeks – what’s called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;About 1 in 3 Americans will get shingles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most recover, it sometimes causes &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/dianne-feinstein-shingles-complications-encephalitis-0b89e58478eb8f1785886ed9a9eda801"&gt;severe complications.&lt;/a&gt; If it infects an eye it can cause vision loss. Up to 20% of shingles patients suffer excruciating nerve pain months or even years after the rash itself is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It’s not clear exactly how Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia form. But certain viruses that sneak inside the nervous system – especially members of the herpes family including the chickenpox virus -- have long been suspected of adding to genetic and other factors that make people more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-024-01511-x"&gt;Last summer&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital reported that an episode of shingles could raise someone’s risk of dementia by about 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Partly, it’s because that virus can cause inflammation, bad for organs including the brain. It also can directly infect blood vessels in the brain, causing clots and impeding blood flow, said Colorado’s Nagel, a risk both for strokes and for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;More intriguing, her lab also discovered shingles can spur formation of a sticky protein called amyloid that’s one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Adults who get recommended vaccines tend to have other brain-healthy habits including exercising and a good diet, which made it hard to prove an extra benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Stanford’s Geldsetzer took advantage of “a natural experiment” in Wales, which opened shingles vaccinations with an age limit: anyone 80 or older on Sept. 1, 2013, was ineligible but those still 79 could squeeze in. Comparing seniors who just met or just missed that cutoff would mimic a research study that randomly assigned otherwise similar people to be vaccinated or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Geldsetzer’s team analyzed more than 280,000 medical records and found evidence that vaccination did offer some protection against dementia. At the time, people received a first-generation vaccine called Zostavax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An important next step is testing whether today’s vaccine, Shingrix, also offers dementia protection, Nagel said. Another research group recently reported some evidence that it does. Vaccine manufacturer GSK last month announced a collaboration with UK health officials to track seniors’ cognitive health as they get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Geldsetzer also hopes to further study that earlier shot to see if the type of vaccine might make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Shingrix is a onetime vaccination, given in two doses a few months apart. The CDC recommends it starting at age 50 for most people but also for younger adults with certain immune-weakening conditions – including those who years ago got that first-generation shingles vaccine. Fewer than 40% of eligible Americans have gotten vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Side effects including injection-site pain and flu-like fever and achiness are common. The CDC cautions if you’re currently fighting another virus such as the flu or COVID-19, to wait on a shingles shot until you’re well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While there’s no proven prevention for dementia, doctors also recommend other commonsense steps to lower the risk. Stay socially and cognitively active.

And “women seem to benefit more,” important as &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-b86a1425061641518a25bcfcc99e08cc"&gt;they’re at higher risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study tracked people in Wales who were around 80 when receiving the world’s first-generation shingles vaccine over a decade ago. Now, Americans &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html"&gt;50 and older&lt;/a&gt; are urged to get a newer vaccine that's proven more effective against shingles than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The new findings add another reason for people to consider rolling up their sleeves, said Dr. Maria Nagel of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, who studies viruses that infiltrate the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The virus “is a risk for dementia and now we have an intervention that can decrease the risk,” Nagel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;With Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia on the rise in an aging population, “the implications of the study are profound,” Dr. Anupam Jena, a Harvard physician and health economist, wrote in a Nature commentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Anyone who’s had ever had chickenpox – nearly everybody born before 1980 – harbors that virus for the rest of their life. It hides in nerves and can break out when the immune system weakens from illness or age, causing painful, blister-like sores typically on one side of the body that last for weeks – what’s called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;About 1 in 3 Americans will get shingles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most recover, it sometimes causes &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://apnews.com/article/dianne-feinstein-shingles-complications-encephalitis-0b89e58478eb8f1785886ed9a9eda801"&gt;severe complications.&lt;/a&gt; If it infects an eye it can cause vision loss. Up to 20% of shingles patients suffer excruciating nerve pain months or even years after the rash itself is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It’s not clear exactly how Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia form. But certain viruses that sneak inside the nervous system – especially members of the herpes family including the chickenpox virus -- have long been suspected of adding to genetic and other factors that make people more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-024-01511-x"&gt;Last summer&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital reported that an episode of shingles could raise someone’s risk of dementia by about 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Partly, it’s because that virus can cause inflammation, bad for organs including the brain. It also can directly infect blood vessels in the brain, causing clots and impeding blood flow, said Colorado’s Nagel, a risk both for strokes and for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;More intriguing, her lab also discovered shingles can spur formation of a sticky protein called amyloid that’s one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Adults who get recommended vaccines tend to have other brain-healthy habits including exercising and a good diet, which made it hard to prove an extra benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Stanford’s Geldsetzer took advantage of “a natural experiment” in Wales, which opened shingles vaccinations with an age limit: anyone 80 or older on Sept. 1, 2013, was ineligible but those still 79 could squeeze in. Comparing seniors who just met or just missed that cutoff would mimic a research study that randomly assigned otherwise similar people to be vaccinated or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Geldsetzer’s team analyzed more than 280,000 medical records and found evidence that vaccination did offer some protection against dementia. At the time, people received a first-generation vaccine called Zostavax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An important next step is testing whether today’s vaccine, Shingrix, also offers dementia protection, Nagel said. Another research group recently reported some evidence that it does. Vaccine manufacturer GSK last month announced a collaboration with UK health officials to track seniors’ cognitive health as they get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Geldsetzer also hopes to further study that earlier shot to see if the type of vaccine might make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Shingrix is a onetime vaccination, given in two doses a few months apart. The CDC recommends it starting at age 50 for most people but also for younger adults with certain immune-weakening conditions – including those who years ago got that first-generation shingles vaccine. Fewer than 40% of eligible Americans have gotten vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Side effects including injection-site pain and flu-like fever and achiness are common. The CDC cautions if you’re currently fighting another virus such as the flu or COVID-19, to wait on a shingles shot until you’re well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While there’s no proven prevention for dementia, doctors also recommend other commonsense steps to lower the risk. Stay socially and cognitively active. And control high blood pressure and, for people with diabetes, high blood sugar, both of which are linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;—-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Pascal Geldsetzer, at Stanford University, said: “For the first time we are able to say much more confidently that the shingles vaccine causes a reduction in dementia risk. If this truly is a causal effect, we have a finding that’s of tremendous importance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers took advantage of a vaccination rollout that took place in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/wales" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Wales&lt;/a&gt; more than a decade ago. Public health policy dictated that from 1 September 2013, people born on or after 2 September 1933 became eligible for the Zostavax shot, while those who were older missed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The policy created a natural experiment where the older population was sharply divided into two groups depending on their access to the vaccine. This allowed the researchers to compare dementia rates in older people born weeks apart but on either side of the vaccine eligibility divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After accounting for the fact that not all those eligible for the vaccine received it, the researchers found vaccination led to a 20% reduction in dementia risk, with the strongest effect in women. Anupam Jena, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School, said the implications were profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dementia affects more than 55 million people globally and is the leading cause of death in the UK. One in three will develop the condition in their lifetime, and while drugs that slow the disease have recently been approved, there is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When people contract chickenpox the virus remains dormant in their nerve cells for life. But the virus can reactivate and cause shingles in older people whose immune systems are waning, or in individuals with weakened immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest work, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, is not the first hint that shingles vaccines might shield against dementia. When Zostavax was rolled out in the US in 2006, several studies found lower rates of dementia in people who received the shots. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/25/shingles-vaccine-shingrix-may-delay-dementia-onset-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Oxford researchers reported an even stronger protective effect&lt;/a&gt; in people who received Shingrix, a newer vaccine. Geldsetzer is now looking for philanthropic and private foundations to fund a randomised clinical trial to confirm any benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is unclear how shingles vaccines might protect against dementia, but one theory is that they reduce inflammation in the nervous system by preventing reactivation of the virus. Another theory is that the vaccines induce broader changes in the immune system that are protective. These wider effects are seen more often in women, potentially explaining the sex differences in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an accompanying article, Jena wrote: “Although it is still unclear precisely how herpes zoster vaccination lowers the risk of dementia, the implications of the study are profound. The vaccine could represent a cost-effective intervention that has public-health benefits strongly exceeding its intended purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Julia Dudley, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said the study strengthened the emerging link between shingles vaccination and reduced dementia risk. “While previous studies suggested an association, this research offers stronger evidence of a direct link, with greater benefit observed in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s unclear exactly how the shingles vaccine might influence dementia risk. It may reduce inflammation, support the immune system in ways that protect the brain or involve other mechanisms. It’s important to note that this study looked at the Zostavax vaccine rather than Shingrix, which is now more commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Understanding this link better, including the reason for any differences between men and women, could open new avenues for dementia prevention and treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Maxime Taquet, whose Oxford study found a reduced dementia risk after Shingrix vaccination, said adjuvants in that vaccine, which make the immune response more potent, may play a role. Both studies “provide strong support for the hypothesis that shingles vaccination reduces dementia risk, with the newer recombinant vaccine offering superior protection,” he said. “A key question is whether this enhanced protection is due to improved shingles prevention or the adjuvant’s immunological effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPVy1mZ254YmZWSWFnekZEbVFONTJjQWV2UzVZTUE2ZGJRU3dUTWNiME9Hc0FmNGZTTzlTNmVta0pzeXVvSTJIcjlrcXJFb1N1NGdQQTgwVDZ4M3Qwam9LU3dMS3RkcTZ1VlMwX0FJcVR2UHg3RlhEdC02aUIyUFdkQ3NTLUUtS0h1enFxY0M1MlFkUm93NDExU3lyb2ZJN25HYWdISDJ3dWdFaDIwbmlmR0tmX0JyRXB4ZWVfeUg1RUNReEc4Wm1Z</guid></item><item><title>World’s smallest pacemaker is the size of a grain of rice - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPQ1NlanNUYjIwdG1ZbFdSVl8yZVEyc3RsMGl3eFFCM3g5YmhVSFk4c2pGdk5CeEpCVUtUSzFWSDd6NmNtTURnSnFvTU9HV2JNQ1h1NDZPSmJmWWFsTm5mYXRIR1g0SDc3UjF0LTQ2ekN2RVFkVHJEa1JhV2JSYnNJQ0E5aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A dissolvable &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/pacemaker-primary-battery-research/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pacemaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; that’s smaller than a grain of rice and &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/bacteria-powered-solar-panels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:powered by light;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;powered by light&lt;/a&gt; could become an invaluable tool for saving the lives of newborn infants., The device can be implanted noninvasively via syringe, and may also be useful for adult patients dealing with certain heart defects. The medical breakthrough is detailed in a study published April 2 in &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08726-4" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-defects/data/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one percent of infants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;one percent of infants&lt;/a&gt; are born with heart defects every year. The majority of these cases only require a temporary implant for about seven days to allow time for the heart to naturally self-repair. But for low-resource regions of the world lacking access to advanced medical care, what should be a simple procedure can often end in tragedy. Meanwhile, the current standard for temporary pacemakers in adults also presents difficulties. Most procedures involve surgeons sewing electrodes directly onto the heart, then attaching those electrodes to an external pacing box using wires that exit a patient’s chest. Doctors remove the electrodes once they are no longer needed, but post-surgery risks include infection, damaged tissue, dislodgment, and blood clots. The wires sometimes also become encased in scar tissue, presenting further complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died. He had a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery. When the wires were removed, he experienced internal bleeding,” experimental cardiologist and study co-lead Igor Efimov explained in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2021, a Northwestern University team including Efimov unveiled a &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2021/06/first-ever-transient-pacemaker-harmlessly-dissolves-in-body/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:quarter-sized, biodegradable temporary pacemaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;quarter-sized, biodegradable temporary pacemaker&lt;/a&gt; without cumbersome batteries, rigid components, or wiring. The device relies on near-field communication protocols similar to those used in RFID tags and smartphones to complete electronic payments. For this to work, however, the pacemaker needed to include a built-in antenna to relay radio frequency commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When the wearable device (left) detects an irregular heartbeat, it emits light to activate the pacemaker. These short pulses—which penetrate through the patient’s skin, breastbone and muscles—control the pacing. Credit: John Rogers / Northwestern University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our original pacemaker worked well. It was thin, flexible and fully resorbable. But the size of its receiver antenna limited our ability to miniaturize it,” said its co-creator and bioelectronics pioneer John Rogers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Rogers, Efimov, and collaborators spent the next few years researching ways to shrink their temporary pacemaker to even smaller proportions. They eventually realized they could swap out the radio antenna for a design that instead relies on light-based data transmission. They also replaced the original device’s near-field communication power source with a galvanic cell—a type of battery that converts chemical energy into electrical energy. In the new version, the pacemaker relies on two metal electrodes that generate an electrical current after interacting with surrounding biofluids. This current is then directed to stimulate and regulate the heart through a miniscule, infrared light-activated switch installed on the battery’s opposite side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right: Traditional pacemaker, leadless pacemaker, and new bioresorbable pacemaker. Credit: John Rogers / Northwestern University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” said Efimov. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand. It turns out that our bodies are great conductors of light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Because the human heart requires only a small amount of electrical stimulation, researchers were able to shrink their next-generation pacemaker even smaller. The final result is a 1-millimeter-thick device measuring just 1.8 mm wide and 3.5 mm long that is still capable of delivering as much electrical stimulation as a standard pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Given its materials safely dissolve over time, the pacemaker also doesn’t require any follow-up invasive surgery to remove it. This dramatically cuts down on the potential for post-op complications and trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But why stop at just one miniature pacemaker? Efimov, Rogers, and collaborators believe that further advancements could allow the deployment of multiple devices across the heart. Once implanted, designers could coordinate them to move independently or together based on specific light wavelengths. This could lead to more complex synchronization therapies, including those that treat arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We also could incorporate our pacemakers into other medical devices like heart valve replacements, which can cause heart block,” suggested Efimov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The device’s size also means it can be incorporated into other implantable tools such as transcatheter aortic valve replacements, pain inhibitors, as well as nerve and bone restoration techniques. These future possibilities, however, all trace back to the team’s original goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our major motivation was children,” said Efimov. “Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPQ1NlanNUYjIwdG1ZbFdSVl8yZVEyc3RsMGl3eFFCM3g5YmhVSFk4c2pGdk5CeEpCVUtUSzFWSDd6NmNtTURnSnFvTU9HV2JNQ1h1NDZPSmJmWWFsTm5mYXRIR1g0SDc3UjF0LTQ2ekN2RVFkVHJEa1JhV2JSYnNJQ0E5aw</guid></item><item><title>World’s smallest: Injectable pacemaker uses body fluids for power, dissolves post use - Interesting Engineering</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNX0JDZmpORkJZbWx6NVlUZmJzcDA3VXlsOW9BX1ZHTEhJb1M1ZncxaWNjTGg2emh5Wk5vMXNGckwta2E4d1FSR3RKZVhBY19ST3RMUTBrektpejg5b1RZYXpsOERhaTlfOHVkNVhMNnZVYjlHM2RqYW5GdFp6TVVvcXBOckU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true   articleBody_firstLetter__fWMYV body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers at Northwestern University have created a highly advanced, ultra-miniature pacemaker designed for injection via a syringe that is capable of dissolving harmlessly afterward. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new device, designed for temporary pacing, is particularly useful for infants suffering from congenital heart defects as it provides a less invasive alternative when traditional pacemakers are needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The device is smaller than a grain of rice and can be paired with a soft, flexible, wireless wearable designed to be attached to the patient’s chest. The thermostatic device, when worn, monitors the heartbeat of the individual, and when an irregular heartbeat is detected, it emits a light pulse capable of piercing the skin and activating the pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” said Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer John A. Rogers, who led the device development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our major motivation was children,” added study co-lead Igor Efimov. “About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects — regardless of whether they live in a low-resource or high-resource country. The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a surgery. Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device. And no additional surgery is necessary to remove it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-tiny-body-powered-innovation"&gt;A tiny, body-powered innovation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most challenging part of shrinking the pacemaker even further was its power supply. The team redesigned the near-field communication-activated antenna system to a light-activated system, which greatly enhanced the effectiveness of the device while also drastically shrinking its size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make the device even smaller, the research team had to rethink how to power the device. Rather than using a battery, the pacemaker now works as a small galvanic cell that generates electrical pulses using two different metal electrodes and the biofluids of the body. The chemical reaction produces the electricity required, which then cathodes the &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/worlds-1st-titanium-heart-patient-discharged" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, hence, stimulating it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When the pacemaker is implanted into the body, the surrounding biofluids act as the conducting electrolyte that electrically joins those two metal pads to form the battery,” Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-expanding-possibilities-in-medicine"&gt;Expanding possibilities in medicine&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The device uses infrared light, which penetrates deeply and safely into the body. When the wearable detects a dangerously low &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/ai-to-predict-heart-attacks" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; rate, it automatically triggers an LED to flash at a normal heart rhythm, activating the pacemaker accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The heart requires a tiny amount of electrical stimulation,” Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1078512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “By minimizing the size, we dramatically simplify the implantation procedures, we reduce trauma and risk to the patient, and, with the dissolvable nature of the device, we eliminate any need for secondary surgical extraction procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Due to the small size of these pacemakers, doctors could implant several devices in various locations around the &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/health/artificial-blood-vessels-heart-bypass-surgery" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; and then turn them on separately using different colored lights. This may enable the treatment of other heart rhythms, including arrhythmias.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This advanced technology also has possible other uses under bioelectronics medicine like speeding up healing in nerves and bones, treating wounds, or blocking pain.&lt;/p&gt;

You don’t need a gym membership, shiny new &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/best-mens-running-shoes-b2266041.html" title="14 best running shoes for all types of runs, tried and tested by our experts"&gt;running shoes&lt;/a&gt; or any other expensive equipment to do it – just leave the house and put one foot in front of the other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The return on investment for doing so is vast. Sure, there are surface-level impacts such as increased calorie burn to aid weight management. But you’re also likely to experience a boost in your mood and improved heart health, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer and an active person, it’s this second group of benefits that persuaded me to start walking &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-health-benefits-weight-loss-b2715321.html"&gt;10,000 steps a day &lt;/a&gt;– a habit I enjoyed so much I’ve stuck with it for the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why 10,000? This common fitness goal is arbitrary, scientifically, and stems from the marketing campaign for a 1960s Japanese pedometer called the manpo-kei (which roughly translates as “10,000-step metre”). Its main selling point is that it’s a nice round number, with a 2023 University of Granada &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000" rel="nofollow"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; claiming 8,000 is “the optimal number of steps at which most people obtain the greatest benefits”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of this, I’ve found the five-figure step target works for me. Here’s why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five reasons why I walk 10,000 steps per day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 drMMhy jrHgaY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It improves my mood &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does anyone form a habit? Usually because it serves a purpose, or because you enjoy it. For me, walking ticks both boxes, which is the main reason why I try to do rather a lot of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I’m working from home, a quick lunchtime loop of the park never fails to send my mood skyward, while a post-work walk with my dog remains my favourite way to unwind. As someone who grew up in the countryside, there are bonus feel-good points on offer if the walk is somewhere &lt;a href="/climate-change/news/green-space-health-lifespan-benefits-b2204559.html"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research seems to support this. A 2020 study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734587/"&gt;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/a&gt; concluded that regular walkers “had better emotional health than those who did not exercise regularly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The average number of walks per week was significantly and positively associated with emotional health,” it adds. “However, the average walk duration had no significant impact on the emotional health of respondents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This goes some way to showing that you don’t need to take 10,000 steps to enjoy walking’s myriad perks – simply getting outside is likely to do you a whole lot of good. But I’ve found this number is a good fit for my lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reminds me to take &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/walking-exercise-heart-disease-cancer-eight-hours-behind-a-desk-a7159166.html"&gt;regular breaks from my desk&lt;/a&gt; during the work day, and encourages me to spend enough time outside to keep my happiness levels at a premium. On the flip side, if I’m feeling a bit sluggish in the afternoon, a glance at my &lt;a href="/tech/best-smartwatches-2024-apple-fitbit-samsung-b2507409.html"&gt;smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; inevitably tells me I’m falling short of this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/what-is-interval-training-benefits-b2724598.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is interval training, and how could walking intervals boost your health and fitness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-none"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-482ou5-0 hWkBIi"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2813%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2813%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2813%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Research has found that walkers had ‘better emotional health than those who did not exercise regularly’" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-41836"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Research has found that walkers had ‘better emotional health than those who did not exercise regularly’&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Harry Bullmore)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It doesn’t have to be a big commitment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only a small portion of my daily steps usually come from long, formal walks. Instead, I tally them up gradually throughout the day via a few simple behaviour changes – trading escalators for stairs, for example, or using a bus stop slightly further from the house rather than waiting for the next bus to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another tip I picked up from a chat with sports scientist and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://walk-active.com/app-funnel/"&gt;WalkActive&lt;/a&gt; founder Joanna Hall is to identify a place I often find myself, then plan a five, 10 and 15-minute out-and-back route I can do from that spot. That way, whenever I’m at a loss during my lunch break or stuck waiting somewhere, I can squeeze in a quick walk and feel all the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little can do a lot too. A 2023 study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/World-s-largest-study-shows-the-more-you-walk-the-lower-your-risk-of-death-even-if-you-walk-fewer-than-5-000-steps"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology &lt;/a&gt;found that “walking at least 3,867 steps a day started to reduce the risk of dying from any cause, and 2,337 steps a day reduced the risk of dying from diseases of the heart and blood vessels”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research later adds: “An increase of 1,000 steps a day was associated with a 15 per cent reduction in the risk of dying from any cause, and an increase of 500 steps a day was associated with a seven per cent reduction in dying from cardiovascular disease”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, movement shouldn’t be seen as pointless just because you’re not hitting the 21st century gold standards of 10,000 steps a day or an hour-long gym session. Small amounts of activity accumulated consistently over time (an approach sometimes called &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-snacking-workouts-b2623880.html"&gt;exercise snacking&lt;/a&gt;) can make a big difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-fitness-for-longevity-b2706750.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The 80:20 training routine that can help you live longer according to a specialist trainer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-fitness-for-longevity-b2706750.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/World-s-largest-study-shows-the-more-you-walk-the-lower-your-risk-of-death-even-if-you-walk-fewer-than-5-000-steps"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-482ou5-0 hWkBIi"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Only a small portion of my daily steps usually come from long, formal walks" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-41837"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Only a small portion of my daily steps usually come from long, formal walks&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (The Independent / Harry Bullmore)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s accessible &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I watched a &lt;a href="/life-style/fitness-influencers-exercise-depression-study-b2557281.html"&gt;fitness influencer&lt;/a&gt; get ready for a run on Instagram the other day and, between the &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/best-energy-gels-b2523822.html"&gt;energy gels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/running/best-running-sunglasses-pairs-b2081965.html"&gt;sunglasses&lt;/a&gt;, specialist vest and other running paraphernalia, it looked like a military operation. And I’m all for that – if you’re passionate about something, why not throw the kitchen sink at it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for busy individuals seeking a time-savvy way to add movement into their day, walking could be a more accessible solution: simply lace up your shoes and leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="/topic/gym"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt;, there’s no commute to factor in, nor are there any membership fees to worry about, but you’re still getting your fitness fix. The &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/behealthy/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) recommends adults aged 19-64 do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, so one brisk 20-minute walk per day leaves you just 10 minutes shy of this target. The pay-off is impressive too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of developing many long-term conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke and some cancers,” the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/exercise-health-benefits/#:~:text=Whatever%20your%20age%2C%20there's%20strong,%2C%20stroke%2C%20and%20some%20cancers."&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; reports. “Research shows that physical activity can also boost self-esteem, mood, sleep quality and energy, as well as reducing your risk of stress, clinical depression, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the more reason to lace up those &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/best-mens-running-shoes-b2266041.html"&gt;trainers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anger-autoimmune-disease-b2724406.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rage and autoimmune disease: is there a link between suppressed anger and the women’s health crisis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-none"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-482ou5-0 hWkBIi"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2816%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2816%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2816%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The pay-off of regular exercise is impressive" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-41838"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;The pay-off of regular exercise is impressive&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Harry Bullmore)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s enjoyable, approachable and flexible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard someone say they “have” to go for a &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-start-running-beginners-guide-b2508104.html"&gt;run&lt;/a&gt; or commit to a &lt;a href="/life-style/hiit-workout-home-fitness-b2027649.html"&gt;HIIT session&lt;/a&gt;? People feel they need to sweat and suffer for a workout to count, but exercise is hardly going to become a habit if you hate every second of it. Instead, I believe the workout you consistently do is always going to be more effective than the one you consistently don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking has something to offer pretty much everyone because it’s more approachable than other types of exercise, and there are so many different ways to make it enjoyable. You could meet friends for a social stroll, explore somewhere new on foot or pair your walk with a podcast to keep things interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favourite approach is to use Google or Instagram to find a new, interesting spot near where I live, then go and have a mosey around.

Walking puts the large muscles in your legs to work, and these muscles need oxygen to help fuel their efforts, so your heart rate rises to meet the increased demand. Regularly raising your heart rate through &lt;a href="/news/health/people-academics-b2340172.html"&gt;cardio exercise&lt;/a&gt; can improve your heart health, burn calories and boost your cardiovascular fitness (your body’s ability to take in and use oxygen).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real-world benefits are plain to see. Whether you’re running around with your children or chasing down a bus, improved cardiovascular fitness will make these activities feel significantly easier. If you sit at a desk all day, taking regular movement breaks can keep you fend off related impacts such as &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/flexibility-best-stretches-tight-hips-workout-tips-b2688165.html"&gt;tight hips&lt;/a&gt; and lower back pain, while increased activity levels also reduce your risk of heart disease and many other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can be a handy weight loss tool too, if that’s your goal. A calorie deficit (burning more calories than you consume) is the common denominator behind weight loss, and walking increases energy expenditure. Paired with an appropriate diet, this can be used to create a sustainable calorie deficit and help you lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experienced exercisers may need more intense activities to spark an increase in cardiovascular fitness, as they will already have a good base level. Research also points towards a “brisk walk”, rather than an amble, being needed to see some fitness benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2018 study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/776"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found a cadence of 100 or more steps per minute was linked to “absolutely defined moderate-intensity”, tying into the WHO weekly physical activity guidelines of “at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity” per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/fitness-class-affordable-gym-price-wealth-inclusion-b2706589.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness has a class problem – here’s what we can do about it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-none"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="7" class="sc-482ou5-0 hWkBIi"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2817%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2817%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/16/Untitled-design-%2817%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Fitness writer Harry Bullmore on a coastal walk" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 IQpjM inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-41840"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 imeAUH"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Fitness writer Harry Bullmore on a coastal walk&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (The Independent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The verdict: Should you walk 10,000 steps a day?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing some physical activity is better than doing none,” is the official line from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;. If walking allows you to introduce some exercise into your week where you wouldn’t otherwise have had any, or you’re able to ramp up your existing activity levels, chances are it’s going to do you a lot of good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean you need to walk 10,000 steps a day. Instead, try finding an achievable goal that’s slightly higher than your current step count, stick with it and then experiment with increasing this figure if it feels good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all my waxing lyrical about walking’s many plus points, I’d also recommend adding more variety into your exercise plans if you have time – variety is, reputedly, the spice of life after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training in particular offers impressive bang for your buck, doing exactly what it says on the tin by strengthening your bones, muscles and joints. It also improves your mobility, helping you handle everyday tasks with ease and lowering your risk of injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifting &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-start-weight-lifting-b2545639.html"&gt;weights&lt;/a&gt; is something I love to do, along with any number of other activities from gymnastics to &lt;a href="/sport/football"&gt;football&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/what-is-padel-b2566548.html"&gt;padel&lt;/a&gt; – as a fitness writer, inhaling exercise in all its forms comes with the territory. Yet, I always come back to walking. For me, the &lt;a href="/topic/mental-health"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; benefits are hard to beat, and I find it’s a great way to slow down and gather my thoughts.

Everyone is different, and goals should be individualised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a desk-worker who struggles to squeeze in any exercise is going to have very different expectations to a run club stalwart with an active job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing we need to be conscious of is setting realistic targets,” says Dr Elroy Aguiar, an assistant professor of exercise science at the University of Alabama. “If someone is doing 4,000 or 5,000 steps per day, and you tell them to do 10,000, that’s doubling their amount of daily activity, which can be problematic or even demotivating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the best place to start is to take a look at your phone or fitness tracker and see how many steps you currently average per day. From here, set a goal of walking 10-20 per cent more than your average daily step count each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally speaking, if you improve your baseline steps by about 2,000 per day, that’s a sufficient amount of extra activity to improve health markers like blood pressure and body composition,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When maintaining this new target feels manageable, try setting a fresh goal of 10-20 per cent more than your updated average, then slowly build this up over time to reach the health-promoting total of 8,000 (or more). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/rucking-walking-10000-steps-a-day-b2711070.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I walked 10,000 steps with a weighted backpack every day for a week – here are five reasons I’m not stopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 14:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPTkd2OFpYelpNWVJ4d2tVd1VadlNkX0VxQlhSNnVfMHFLa2JBUUZUcUJfLV9CRXA1WldwNkNYU2VBY0t0TWRLR3lCdy1DbFQtamFoWkpWZGZjczR4RXo3U1h4eXpzeGlFX0E4VHhVMDFRWmUzNTlJaFJvY3h1NElMcXdpdmdZVXlZdF9leEFqRGEzVVU</guid></item><item><title>Why Sourdough Bread May Promote Gut Health -

Ideally, store-bought sourdough should stick to this simple ingredient list.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Unfortunately, many mass-produced varieties contain added ingredients such as vinegar, yeast, and vital wheat gluten, among others.

Traditional sourdough fermentation naturally breaks down gluten, making it easier to digest for those with mild sensitivities. “However, added gluten may reduce this benefit, making the bread less suitable for individuals with gluten intolerance,” says Johnson.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="19" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="benefits of sourdough bread" title="benefits of sourdough bread" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-kneading-bread-dough-royalty-free-image-1743101356.pjpeg?crop=1xw:0.9986xh;center,top&amp;amp;resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-kneading-bread-dough-royalty-free-image-1743101356.pjpeg?crop=1xw:0.9986xh;center,top&amp;amp;resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-kneading-bread-dough-royalty-free-image-1743101356.pjpeg?crop=1xw:0.9986xh;center,top&amp;amp;resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-kneading-bread-dough-royalty-free-image-1743101356.pjpeg?crop=1xw:0.9986xh;center,top&amp;amp;resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-16rzoaq e1geg53v2"&gt;Stefania Pelfini, La Waziya Photography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-1wp0who e1geg53v0"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-16rzoaq e1geg53v1"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="20" data-lazy-id="P0-14"&gt;&lt;h2 title="How to make a healthy sourdough bread" data-anchor-id="how-to-make-a-healthy-sourdough-bread" class="body-h2 css-w63prd emt9r7s1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="20.0"&gt;How to make a healthy sourdough bread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;First, make sure you set aside enough time to allow the fermentation process to occur. It takes roughly five days or more to ferment properly, says Arteche. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Then make sure your starter—which you can purchase online or at some bakeries, or look for a recipe to DIY—is vibrant and active. According to Johnson, your starter should:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="23" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.0"&gt;Double in size before use, which shows strong fermentation activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.1"&gt;Have a sour aroma, which indicates healthy bacterial activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.2"&gt;Contain visible bubbles, reflecting active fermentation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.3"&gt;Have no discoloration or fuzzy patches, which indicates spoilage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;The loaf itself should show a significant rise during bulk fermentation and have a slightly tangy flavor, characteristic of natural fermentation. The crust should be crisp with a light, slightly chewy crumb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Sourdough bread can be a part of a healthy diet and may support gut and metabolic health. But, look for or make your own loaves that have the fewest ingredients (just flour, sourdough culture, water, and salt).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In addition, as with all breads, watch portion sizes, pair with healthy fats and protein, and opt for whole-grain varieties, when possible, for the biggest nutritional punch from sourdough bread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 14:47:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNTFRQeU5hOThSMG1VYXFSOE9FdnltNmFKdHFsTm14d0g2NDY5b2xVbXZhR1JnUE9NdkhvUGRyMnFnbEV2QlA5Z1h4dTBwa3ZLcjAtb29qZzBxWVdJX2pVejJYMVNoOFRmWmV1ck1RenJmcVItMDlQdnJwTUJqelh0bDFWSHFMRG10UGNOeXg3NHZwR1owUVBFdWQ0aw</guid></item><item><title>Hospital's flippant response after TEN of its maternity nurses working in same ward develop brain tumors - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxPelBZdmtCT0xnZFE1OGxzZmV1ekRBZkl3M1hDSzZMYVR3bFIzTkxXNkttb1RfVU1yd0hZd2ZldmZyUjhvRHdTaGZNblpIOHBXTXBpUTVGenVZdkcxQ2cwb21jWlVtS3lrTTNSRk9JbVRKYUtIV3FPb2ExTmJVNGRoQ2FDRnFBQnZlOXV1aVlYRlhKNVRnQVFYY2VwUG9PaVnSAaQBQVVfeXFMT1o2TEJrZHFCcnRsbnZ3ZC14QWhNSEg4allaeEhWQUJOelplMkYtaUdVSE04SDh6T0prWFdxTUtLNGxsU05fNHFOc3IzZnctVWNfZl9QLUdCd20tZGRLODJZV292ejFFZHBvMEpDUjhEY3Q5TFpVYmU2bnFqTnd3VW1FMTc3djFoMk5TMm5yUVo5U2hhUkFHTjNqcUFzOEhHdW5QdVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-f6b8b740-0fc5-11f0-b66b-b9d57686ea57"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt; maternity ward has seen a spike in nurses diagnosed with brain tumors - as staff fear conditions are making them sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Workers at Newton-Wellesley Hospital have been struck with different types of brain tumors over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One claimed as many as ten nurses on the same floor - including herself - had been diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some have been benign and some cancerous, she believed that the diagnoses were serious cause for concern for the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nurse told &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/newton-wellesley-hospital-nurses-brain-cancer-cases/"&gt;WBZ-TV&lt;/a&gt;: 'It's getting to the point where the number just increases, and you start saying am I crazy thinking this. This can't just be a coincidence.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the outlet three of them have had surgery, but believed the hospital has not been supportive enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want reassurance because this has not been a reassuring past few months for a lot of the staff members,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We want to feel safe, the same way we want to make our patients feel safe.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One Newton-Wellesley Hospital nurse claimed that as many as ten nurses on the same floor, including herself, received a brain tumor diagnosis. This can't just be a coincidence,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The hospital claimed that there were 'no environmental risk' after conducting an investigation since December&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns had been growing in the department among nurses, as the number of their colleagues struck with the diagnosis only increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You're going into work every day with that feeling in your gut, and it's a lousy feeling,' she told the outlet.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospital, however, gave a shocking response claiming there were 'no environmental risk' after investigating since December. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a statement the hospital said: 'After we became aware of reported brain tumors in individuals who currently or previously had worked in the same area of the hospital, we conducted an extensive investigation in collaboration with the Department of Occupational Health and Safety, Newton-Wellesley Safety Officer, radiation and pharmaceutical safety offices, and external environmental consultants.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospital told the outlet it had interviewed ten nurses, five of which were said to have different types of brain tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Every staff member who came forward was given the opportunity to be interview by the Occupational Health and Safety team to evaluate each diagnosis in the context of their individual medical history and risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To evaluate for any possible environmental exposures in that area of the hospital, comprehensive environmental assessments following CDC guidelines began in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor. We presented these findings to relevant stakeholder groups, including the staff on the unit and the Massachusetts Nursing Association, and have held forums to meet with clinical and Occupational Health leaders to answer their questions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'You're going into work every day with that feeling in your gut, and it's a lousy feeling,' the nurse said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandy Muse (pictured), the Chief Nursing Officer, signed the hospital statement which said it can 'confidently reassure' the nurses there was no environmental risk at the facility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The hospital is proving the MNA with the test results from the investigation, including those of several external environmental firms,' the statement continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Based on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team members at mass General Brigham/Newton-Wellesley Hospital and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As always, the health and wellbeing of our staff, clinicians, and patients is our absolute top priority.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The statement was given by Jonathon Sonis, the Associate Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Medical Affairs, and Sandy Muse, the Chief Nursing Officer and Senior Vice President of Patient Care Services.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet despite the investigation, as worries persist, the nurses are calling for an independent investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paula Ward of the Massachusetts Nurse Association told the outlet:' I think the concern is [that] we don't know what it is, and nurses are scared, they're worried, and they want to make sure they're not working in an unsafe place.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think the nurses should be the first people - because we're the ones that brought it to their attention - to be told, and we feel like we have been the last to be informed on anything,' the anonymous nurse added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesperson for Newton-Wellesley Hospital confirmed that not all of the nurses were on the unit at the same time and noted that some of the diagnoses pre-date the Covid-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            Researchers historically have viewed autism as a distinctly “male” &lt;a href="https://aane.org/autism-info-faqs/library/autism-adhd/" target="_blank"&gt;neurotype&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But why? Is it because they only paid attention to symptoms in boys, and girls haven’t been screened properly? Boys are 10 times more likely than girls to be referred for autism assessments, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8604819/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2020 review&lt;/a&gt; showed, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10813290/" target="_blank"&gt;a 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that up to 80% of girls and women may receive a diagnosis of social anxiety, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/27/health/what-is-an-eating-disorder-wellness/index.html"&gt;eating disorder&lt;/a&gt; or borderline personality disorder before being accurately diagnosed as autistic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            These biases and shortcomings are the subject of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Off-Spectrum-Science-Autism-Failed/dp/1541605020" target="_blank"&gt;Off the Spectrum&lt;/a&gt;: Why the Science of Autism Has Failed Women and Girls,” a new book by brain imaging expert Gina Rippon.

            Rippon, professor emeritus of cognitive neuroimaging at the Aston Brain Centre in Birmingham, England, investigates how and why scientists and clinicians have systematically underestimated and overlooked autism in women and girls.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000h356md00tm0st@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://bsd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13293-024-00621-3" target="_blank"&gt;In a 2024 review,&lt;/a&gt; Rippon found of the more than 120 studies testing brain models of autism that she examined, nearly 70% of the studies only tested men or included very few women. She noted that less than 10% of the 4,000 participants in those studies were women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000i356m9l9d9b6b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rippon said she was startled to discover the extent to which she and her colleagues had fundamentally misunderstood the nature of autism in girls and women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylpzn2000j356mul617z40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CNN recently talked with Rippon about autism in girls and women, the challenges of current diagnostics, and how medical professionals can think differently about screening without bias.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What inspired you to investigate autism in girls?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8yiufb80000356m1ph0m8rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Gina Rippon: &lt;/strong&gt;There was this very strong belief up until recently that autism was a male problem. As a result, a big industry grew around autism diagnosis to reliably indicate whether a child had autism. But they were only looking at the kind of behavior that was characteristic of boys. If girls came along with similarly disordered behavior, the idea that it might be autism just didn’t emerge.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9000y356m97lx9c95@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were so-called “gold-standard” tests, but because the tests were based on boys, girls would be screened out. For a neuroscientist like me who wanted to look at autism in females, I wouldn’t be able to find any females who had been diagnosed as autistic. It got embedded in our consciousness, “OK, this is a male problem, so we probably better just look at males.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9000z356m9n8almm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; I like to say the diagnostic dice were loaded from the start. There is no biomarker for autism — there’s not a handy X-ray or some physical test we can use to diagnose autism. Instead, there are a huge array of different behaviors which, over the years, have (been) identified as characteristic of autistic children. (But) it’s all based on what it looks like in boys.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90011356m0lr1ek3n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://magazine.smhs.gwu.edu/news/observation-autism" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Pelphrey&lt;/a&gt;, one of the top autism researchers in the world, has two autistic children — one girl, one boy. His wife describes how difficult it was for them to get their daughter diagnosed. You would think they would know what they were talking about, yet their daughter’s diagnosis was dismissed across the board. Experts would say, “She’s shy, she’ll grow out of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s the classic confirmation bias, which is the tendency to interpret new evidence as a confirmation of one’s existing beliefs.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90014356mxb113y65@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers have presented identical hypothetical scenarios to teachers, saying, “This child presents with these kinds of issues in the classroom, so do you think this child might be autistic? Do you think this child might need special support?” Teachers are much more likely to say yes to the notion that the child was autistic and needed support if the child was named Jack than if the child was named Chloe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90015356mbspnqj6h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Behavioral differences in autistic children emerge early on. Those are times when teachers who have broad experience of a much wider range of children should be able to say, “This kind of behavior is unusual. I think we should take it further.” Instead, if behaviors are unusual and it’s a boy, it’s autism, but if behaviors are unusual and it’s a girl, she’s shy, socially anxious, and people might say, “she’ll grow out of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90016356m8nngf1al@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Secondly, autism presents differently in girls versus boys. Girls who are distressed in some way very often internalize their problems. They become withdrawn and shy, stand in the corner, don’t engage with other children. If you’ve got children who are shy and quiet and stand quietly in the corner, you aren’t going to think there’s a problem and maybe you’ll even move on. If you’ve got children who are acting out by banging their heads against a desk or kicking, which is more characteristic of boys, those are the kids you’re going to look at more closely.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90017356mfpl6bagv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The third layer is that there is clear evidence that girls try to camouflage or disguise or mask their problems. That happens very early on, at age 4 or 5. If you find the right way of asking them questions, they will say, “Other people in the class think I’m weird. I try and find out why they think I’m weird, and I try and behave not weird.” I call these kids chameleons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz90018356mjkrgnv62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is nothing new. In the 1980s, a researcher named &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4495836/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Lorna Wing&lt;/a&gt;, who was partially responsible for broadening the notion of autism, said, “Maybe girls are just better at disguising their problems,” and “Maybe girls are taught to behave better earlier on.” It’s not socially acceptable for girls to act out, so they don’t.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can a diagnosis mean to a young woman who has been struggling?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; All the women I spoke to said their first and most powerful reaction on getting a diagnosis of autism was a sense of relief, because it suddenly made so much sense of their lives. For older women, it was very often then a sense of regret, how different their lives would’ve been if they’d known.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001b356m4ngf1h6w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Particularly the girls who are so desperate to belong, what struck me is how much at odds this is from the view of autism as an aloofness — as if autistic individuals aren’t interested in social contact. With autistic females, it’s almost the reverse. They’re desperate for social contact, but they lack what you might call social instinct, knowing how to behave in social situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001c356ms4odt6c9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the girls I talked to for my book told me it’s a bit like how people who are deaf from birth wouldn’t understand that there’s this kind of invisible something that is the sound of words, which people use to communicate with each other. Autistic girls could be described as deaf to the language of social behavior, so they don’t understand how you stand properly or maintain eye contact, or that you aren’t supposed to go on about your favorite subject for an hour. For these girls, a diagnosis can be very freeing and validating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001d356myt68a2vw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How can experts learn to diagnose girls at a younger age?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon&lt;/strong&gt;: One thing that has struck me is that the notion of hypersensitivity to sensory issues such as scratchy clothes, bright lights, smells and so on, is more characteristic of girls on the spectrum than boys. And that’s only just come into the diagnosis. It was in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(DSM-5-TR).&lt;br&gt;Although sensory issues have been very characteristic of autism as a whole — and very often there are reports of autistic children hating loud noises or bright lights or whatever — it wasn’t a diagnostic characteristic until quite recently. Having this in the diagnostic criteria might help.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001f356mbxdwnpfu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Raising awareness and accepting that autistic children of both sexes should be allowed special accommodations at school, such as taking tests in a separate room or wearing headphones. That’s very important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001g356m5hyuf7vu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For autistic girls like chameleons, who might be hypersensitive to what they perceive as social rejection, it’s also important to teach kindness to all children. Some of the saddest interviews I had were the ones with young girls who were hyperaware that people thought they were weird and odd.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001h356mp9vm3hxi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not a fan of pharmaceutical solutions for young children, partly because it is a time at which our brains are hugely plastic. At the same time, sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal disorders are characteristic among autistic kids, and if left untreated these (issues) can interfere with social activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ylwcz9001j356mladu2wlr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s also a lot about autism you can’t treat. A lot of the behavioral difficulties that autistic individuals have are side effects of their autism; they get hugely anxious because they don’t know how to deal with social situations, not because they need anxiety medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Rippon:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s critical for researchers to speak to autistic people and ask, “What is it like to be you?” That perspective is invaluable. There’s a big movement for what is called inclusivity or participatory research, where autistic people become part of the research team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm900gurg00033b6mq3eol5p5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;br&gt;They advise what kind of questions to ask, they advise how you might interpret the answers you’re getting. There’s a video I recommend called “Here Come the Girls,” and in it, autistic women basically say, “We are autistic, and this is what it’s like for us.” I think that inclusivity is the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multidisciplinary team led by the University of Liège has proposed a unified neuroscientific model explaining the mechanisms behind near-death experiences (NDEs), drawing on converging empirical findings across neurobiology, psychology, and evolutionary theory.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that factors such as oxygen deprivation, increased carbon dioxide, and disrupted &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+energy+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt; can initiate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+responses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain responses&lt;/a&gt; that lead to vivid perceptual and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/emotional+experiences/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;emotional experiences&lt;/a&gt; often reported during NDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects reporting NDEs describe a wide range of phenomena, though typically only certain types of experiences are elevated to the level of public interest. Some of the more commonly retold types of NDEs include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out-of-body experiences, where there is a dissociative sense of leaving the physical body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distorted awareness of time, with a sense that time has slowed down, stopped, or accelerated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An emotional sense of calm, peace, and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A flood of memories or having one's life "flash" before their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bright lights, long tunnels, and visitations by deceased relatives or unknown figures perceived as sentient, mystical, or spiritual imagery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many intriguing NDEs capture the imagination, and selection bias pushes us toward focusing on experiences that appear thematically repetitive. Less retold are NDEs that, though just as vivid, contain nightmarish, mundane, or nonsense themes. Subjective states resembling NDEs can occur in both life-threatening and non-life-threatening situations, such as fainting and drug use.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Scientifically, NDEs are described as episodes of disconnected consciousness that occur in contexts involving actual or perceived physical threats. Reported experiences are highly varied in phenomenology, with content and interpretation shaped by triggering conditions such as the individual's psychological state and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physiological+responses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physiological responses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous theories to explain NDEs have included psychological, neurophysiological, and evolutionary models, typically developed independently of a broader research framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the review article, "A neuroscientific model of near-death experiences," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-025-01072-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Reviews Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a narrative review that draws on human and animal studies, psychedelic neuroscience, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical data&lt;/a&gt; to explain how altered states of awareness can emerge at critical moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No single experimental cohort was analyzed as the authors synthesized data from a range of previously published studies. Animal studies and neuroimaging data from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/critically+ill+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;critically ill patients&lt;/a&gt; provided insight into the physiological breakdown that may initiate NDEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consistent pattern of physiological disruption emerged during cardiac arrest and other critical events. Reduced cerebral blood flow triggers hypoxia and elevates carbon dioxide levels.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;A cascade of factors then induces cerebral acidosis and depletes ATP, the cell's primary energy source, and produces a surge in neurotransmitter release across multiple brain systems, including serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, noradrenaline, GABA, acetylcholine, and endorphins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key mechanistic details include elevated serotonin levels and 5-HT2A receptor activation, potentially contributing to visual hallucinations and feelings of hyper-reality. Dopamine release may influence emotional salience. Noradrenaline and acetylcholine appear linked to memory encoding. GABA and endorphins are proposed to induce calming sensations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found parallels between NDEs and psychedelic-induced states, particularly with substances like DMT and ketamine, which affect similar receptor systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological traits such as dissociation proneness and REM sleep intrusion tendencies may predispose individuals to experiencing NDEs under stress. Findings also suggest that NDEs and death-feigning behaviors (thanatosis) may share evolutionary roots as coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the convergence of neurobiological and psychological responses to severe physiological stress, researchers crafted NEPTUNE (Neurophysiological Evolutionary Psychological Theory Understanding Near-death Experience), a model to provide a comprehensive framework integrating diverse lines of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, "Our NEPTUNE model, although theoretical at present, provides a foundation for the next research phase, which will entail empirical testing of each mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research aims to empirically test aspects of the NEPTUNE model using neuroimaging, physiological monitoring, and continued exploration of brain activity near death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEPTUNE also raises questions about consciousness during critical illness and the potential reevaluation of brain death protocols in light of documented surges in brain activity after cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt;

Using data from two national databases, researchers found consistent results: about 16% of pregnant women developed Long COVID symptoms versus 19% of matched non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While pregnancy appears to offer some protection, certain subgroups—such as women with obesity, older maternal age, or who identify as Black—were at higher risk. The findings point to a potential protective role of immune changes during and after pregnancy and highlight the need for more focused Long COVID research in pregnant populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Pregnant women had a lower rate of Long COVID than non-pregnant peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher-Risk Groups:&lt;/strong&gt; Black women, those 35+, and those with metabolic conditions faced higher risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings held across two national health data networks and different definitions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Weill Cornell University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy may offer some protection from developing Long COVID, found a new study led by Weill Cornell Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Utah Health and Louisiana Public Health Institute. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has mostly focused on non-pregnant adults affected by Long COVID— a condition lasting for months after a person recovers from SARS-CoV-2 infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published April 1 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, helps fill a critical gap about Long COVID in women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108360"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg" alt="This shows two pregnant women." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/long-covid-pregnancy-neurosceicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Among the pregnant women, the researchers found that certain groups had higher Long COVID risks than others. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This population is so important and vulnerable, but we had no evidence about their Long COVID risk to guide their care,” said Dr. Chengxi Zang, an instructor in population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine, who co-led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this new data will help clinicians develop better Long COVID prevention and treatment strategies for pregnant women and help those most at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digging into Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tapped into real-world data collected in two large electronic health record-based studies, the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) and the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), under the National Institutes of Health RECOVER initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed data on approximately 72,000 women who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy between March 2020 and June 2023 and about 208,000 age and demographically matched controls who were not pregnant but developed the infection during this period. They looked for signs of Long COVID 180 days after the women recovered from infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the rates of long-term complications related to COVID-19 are lower among pregnant women than comparably matched women who were not pregnant during their infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were consistent across both large databases and held true even when the researchers used different methods to define Long COVID. This consistency adds confidence to the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the PCORnet cohort&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Zang and his colleagues found that about 16 out of 100 pregnant women developed Long COVID compared with about 19 out of 100 non-pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long COVID is defined as having any of the following symptoms: cognitive problems, encephalopathy, sleep disorders, acute pharyngitis, shortness of breath, pulmonary fibrosis, chest pain, diabetes, edema, malnutrition, joint pain, fever, malaise and fatigue. Similar findings were replicated in the N3C cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though we observed that pregnant women have a significant risk of Long COVID, it was surprisingly lower than those who were not pregnant when they had SARS-CoV-2 infection,” Dr. Zang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, some subgroups seemed especially vulnerable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Groups at Higher Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the pregnant women, the researchers found that certain groups had higher Long COVID risks than others. For example, pregnant women who identified as Black, or were of advanced maternal age (age 35 or older at delivery), or had obesity or other metabolic conditions were more likely to develop Long COVID than pregnant women who weren’t part of these groups. However, this risk was still lower than their matched non-pregnant controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research on factors such as inequitable healthcare access, socioeconomic factors and structural racism may help us understand the elevated Long COVID risk in these groups and find ways to protect them,” said Dr. Zang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that the altered immune and inflammatory environment lasting about six weeks after giving birth might contribute to lowering the risk of Long COVID,” Dr. Zang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The observed risk differences in this analysis suggest future dedicated studies of Long COVID in pregnant individuals are needed.” For instance, differences in COVID infection by trimester may be informative for patient counseling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zang and his colleagues at Weill Cornell Medicine are also using electronic health records to study how existing medications may be repurposed to protect pregnant women from Long COVID.               &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was co-led by Dr. Elaine Hill and Dr. Daniel Guth, at the University of Rochester Medical Center; Dr. Torri D.

The observed risk factors for Long COVID included Black race/ethnicity, advanced maternal age, first- and second-trimester infection, obesity, and comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings suggest a high incidence of Long COVID among pregnant individuals, their risk was lower than that of matched non-pregnant females.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2025 13:59:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE1TNUlPM19iQXQ0Ry1Tc3ZFYVlRdWFBYjMtNUYxT3RNVVAxNjg1bGdKNDk3LWFlaFFSTkxNSWpfTFFPOURrOVMxaFNsd3FqcjVsb3dqcXZQUXhSMnpaZzZicER4c3NmNkR6dVBaR1duczlJal90</guid></item></channel></rss>
