Even things that would have once made me roll my eyes. Chromotherapy, sound baths, mushroom extract. Reiki, leg compression boots, strategic humming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If the devil (hopefully the Liz Hurley Bedazzled version) offered me full health in exchange for my soul, I would have a hard time saying no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And so, I am an easy target. I have become a selectively gullible person – disillusioned with mainstream medicine, waiting for a cure, sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of an infrared light panel wearing nothing but a pair of protective wraparound sunglasses and hoping for the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I contracted Covid-19 at a Harry Styles concert in June 2022. Three months later, I was diagnosed with post-Covid-19 syndrome, colloquially known as long Covid because, well, it does like to hang around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2ccfb5f6-a352-4339-8128-b5c1c8345fc2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Walking my dog, I feel free to wear the most unhinged outfits – and nobody minds","elementId":"2ccfb5f6-a352-4339-8128-b5c1c8345fc2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/06/walking-my-dog-i-feel-free-to-wear-the-most-unhinged-outfits-and-nobody-minds"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since then, I have sampled from the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;200+ available symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including but not limited to heart palpitations, gastrointestinal chaos, joint pain, the ability to feel my heartbeat in my arms, brain fog so bad I once forgot how to turn off the shower and the type of fatigue that regularly makes me Google “can you die from tiredness”. At times, a five-minute phone conversation has sent me to bed for days. I’d have to rest halfway up a small set of stairs. I’d answer a single email then slip into a sleep that felt much closer to a coma than a nap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When things are that grim, the promises made by the wellness industry sound very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; appealing. An industry worth &lt;a href="https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/statistics-and-facts/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$6.3tn globally&lt;/a&gt;, with some of the most diabolically persuasive advocates available – celebrities, influencers, internet strangers, a friend’s sister’s boyfriend’s colleague who swears this one supplement made him better in a week. I shudder to think what my own contribution to that figure has been – and I will not be voluntarily doing maths to find out. I’ve been through enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Whenever someone recommends something new, I haven’t had it in me to ask “where’s the rigorous scientific proof of this thing’s efficacy?” when I’ve had “help me! I will do anything to feel well” playing inside my head on a loop for thousands of days. Sometimes this is fine, even great – there are many alternative things that really work for me – I love my acupuncturist! Somatic dance! Shiatsu!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other times, it’s been more sinister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During the screening call for a wellness program I now believe to be at best a pyramid scheme, at worst a cult, I was asked if I felt able to “put aside” my “critical thinking” before they signed me up. I practically begged them to let me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;I’ve submerged myself in ice-cold bath tubs.

I had found the limit of my wilful gullibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I found it again by accidentally taking part in a ceremony to commune with angels because it was advertised as a nice relaxing group meditation. And again, when my local gym offered a free rehabilitation program that went against all the prevailing advice on treating my condition but conveniently herded me towards a long-term membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These are times when suspending my scepticism has felt like a betrayal to myself, when I feel that I’ve been exploited. Now I feel extremely protective of other people like me, too sick to necessarily have the clarity of mind to tell the false promises of wellness culture from the legit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;What else? I’ve done 90-minute sessions lying in a sealed hyperbaric oxygen chamber, which felt somewhat like road-testing my own coffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A small, frighteningly positive man poked my spine and pulled my arms and pummelled my back while he bellowed things like “your immune system works perfectly”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’ve submerged myself in ice-cold bath tubs. Sweated in saunas. Let a man strike a drum balanced on my belly so the vibrations would stimulate my cells. Stirred mushroom powders into hot water for an alleged boost to my cognitive function. Prodded my collar bones, armpits and groin to drain my lymphatic system. Had my chakras realigned. Asked a psychic what to do. Drunk what must now be gallons of celery juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fbc2b14d-6edf-4056-8a65-9f9658449774" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":19,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I do aqua aerobics with women in their 80s – it’s the most fun I’ve had exercising | Kate Leaver","elementId":"fbc2b14d-6edf-4056-8a65-9f9658449774","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/13/i-do-aqua-aerobics-with-women-in-their-80s-its-the-most-fun-ive-had-exercising"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of these things exist on a spectrum of efficacy and intentions – from a floret of kale to a full-blown cult. We will each have our own quota of what we are able to believe. On hard days, I still worry I’m too vulnerable and not discerning enough. On better days, I’m just grateful to have things to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Recently I’ve been going outside first thing, to ask the sun to set my circadian rhythm. I down a pint of water and electrolytes. Place a little device that looks like a high-end sex toy on my sternum to stimulate my vagus nerve. Stand on a vibration plate to move muscles that may otherwise atrophy after roughly 900 days of lying down. Dance aggressively to a Selena Gomez-heavy playlist to release trapped emotion from my body. Put my legs up a wall at every possible opportunity. And guzzle a handful of supplements, thinking to myself, &lt;em&gt;at the very least, maybe I can have some placebo effect, as a little treat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Do I think these things have helped? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Am I sure about that? No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what else can I do? There is no treatment protocol, no known cure for long Covid. Experts disagree on what it even is – &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10174338/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tiny blood clots&lt;/a&gt; preventing oxygen from circulating my body properly? &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs44324-024-00038-x&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/02/long-covid-has-more-than-200-potential-symptoms-selective-gullibility-is-one-of-mine" data-link-name="in body link" rel="sponsored"&gt;Mitochondrial dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/the-long-covid-puzzle-autoimmunity-inflammation-and-other-possible-causes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; Inflammation&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://www.magonlinelibrary.com/doi/full/10.12968/hmed.2022.0123" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;An extreme histamine reaction&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dysautonomia&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;So long as we know so little about something that affects my life so completely, there is always the possibility that something wacky could help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Until there is an advance in medical science and evidence-based treatments, all I can do is hope.

I work in digital marketing at an agency, so I'm glued to a computer screen all day,' she explained during an exclusive chat with the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I am not glued to my computer screen, I am on my phone. It felt natural to assume it was just eye strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've always been the type to brush off little health things like, "Oh, it's nothing." So the idea that it could be something serious didn't even cross my mind.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when her vision 'started to change' in 2019, she finally decided it was time to go to the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A woman who thought her eye pain was from too much screen time has revealed how she discovered that it was actually the first sign that she was battling a harrowing disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amanda Hahn, 29, from New York, was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Things looked blurry, colors seemed off, and my eye just didn't feel right,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew it wasn't just screen fatigue anymore. That's when I went to the eye doctor - and everything escalated quickly from there.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After examining her, the eye doctor suggested she go to the ER for an MRI, and she soon learned that she was battling multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was completely in shock. My parents were out of the country at the time, and I had spent the entire day in the ER waiting for my MRI and the results,' she recalled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a nurse finally came in, she just handed me a pamphlet and said, "This is what your life will look like in 10 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Honestly, I didn't even believe her at first. My mom also has MS, so I was confused... how could this really be happening to me too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I ended up going to several other doctors just to confirm the diagnosis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said there were little clues for years that something was wrong with her - including memory problems and random bouts of numbness - but she 'brushed them off'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The first big symptom that 'made her pause' was a 'sharp pain in her eye' whenever she 'looked down and to the side'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said, 'When I am not glued to my computer screen, I am on my phone.

That mindset helps me stay grounded and positive.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she admitted that she was 'not very healthy' before her diagnosis - 'late nights, bad food choices, and not much activity' during college - she said the diagnosis 'completely changed how she approaches her health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flash forward to now, six years later, and Amanda has learned to live with the disease &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'[Every day] I remind myself that MS is part of my life, but it doesn't define my life,' she explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She often documents her journey with MS on social media, where she said she's received a slew of positive messages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I try to walk every day, eat fewer processed foods, and stick to a low-carb lifestyle.

It can still be really beautiful. I want people to know it's okay to be scared, but it's also possible to keep living a full and happy life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most of all, I hope we can break the stigma that having a disease means you can't live a 'normal' life.

They found remnants of the human pegavirus (HPgV) in half of all brains with Parkinson's and none in those without the degenerative disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with the virus had distinct immune responses and advanced brain changes, which were further impacted by genetic mutations. Parkinson's gets worse over time, gradually degrading the part of the brain that produces dopamine, a chemical critical for controlling movement, which causes tremors, stiffness, and falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with Parkinson's who had the virus in their brains showed more advanced brain damage. Those who had the virus in their blood also showed signs that their cells were struggling to produce energy and clean out damaged parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPgV is spread through blood and is a close relative of the Hepatitis C virus. However, unlike Hepatitis C, HPgV was not previously believed to cause any illness and was thought to lie dormant in the body. This latest study challenges that assumption, suggesting it may play a role in Parkinson's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Igor Koralnik, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine, said in a statement: ‘For a virus that was thought to be harmless, these findings suggest it may have important effects, in the context of Parkinson’s disease. It may influence how Parkinson’s develops, especially in people with certain genetic backgrounds.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact cause of Parkinson’s, which affects about one million Americans and also causes trouble walking and cognitive problems, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14800655/The-huge-Parkinsons-risk-linked-you-LIVE-worse-upmarket-areas-Experts-reveal-risk.html"&gt;is still unknown&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have been researching &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13856205/Doctors-environmental-cause-Parkinsons-young.html"&gt;possible contributors&lt;/a&gt; for years, and viruses are among several possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the brain detects a virus, it triggers inflammation as a defense mechanism. While this is meant to fight the infection, chronic or overzealous inflammation can accidentally damage or kill delicate brain cells, including the dopamine-producing neurons whose death is characteristic of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Michael J Fox, pictured in April 2025, is one of the most high-profile Parkinson's sufferers. He founded The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which has been responsible for landmark research into the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the blood analysis, researchers turned to a library of samples from over 1,000 participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), a major study launched by The Michael J. Fox Foundation to accelerate research and treatment discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists analyzed the brain tissue of 24 deceased individuals. Ten of them had Parkinson's when they died, and 14 did not. They detected the virus in half of the Parkinson's brains and in none of the brains from the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPgV is a common, symptomless infection previously not known to infect the brain. As of 2024, studies estimate that about four percent of Americans have an active HPgV infection, and up to 12 percent have been exposed to the virus at some point in their lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The primary route of transmission is through exposure to infected blood, such as from shared needles or, historically, through blood transfusions before widespread screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In patients with a specific Parkinson’s-related gene mutation, LRRK2, the body’s immune system reacted more aggressively to the virus compared to Parkinson’s patients without the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gene mutation rewired the brain's immune circuitry when the virus was present in the blood, leading to a dysfunctional and harmful inflammatory response that would not have happened if the person had either the virus or the gene mutation alone, but not both together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ensuing inflammation in the brain led to brain damage that contributed to Parkinson's. It damages and kills neurons, particularly the dopamine-producing cells in the brain region known as the substantia nigra, a hallmark of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We were surprised to find it in the brains of Parkinson’s patients at such high frequency and not in the controls,’ Dr Koralnik said. ‘Even more unexpected was how the immune system responded differently, depending on a person’s genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The little-known group of conditions can lead to Parkinson's disease, the fresh study revealed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This suggests it could be an environmental factor that interacts with the body in ways we didn’t realize before.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also detected the virus in the spinal fluid of Parkinson's patients, but not in those without the neurological disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Parkinson’s disease, the area of the brain that produces dopamine begins to deteriorate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to playing a crucial role in the brain’s reward system, dopamine is key to the brain's movement control system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without sufficient dopamine, the brain's movement circuit becomes impaired, leading to stiffness and tremors, as well as difficulty initiating movement, such as getting up from a chair, and slowness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients with the virus in their brain tissue also had a greater build-up of toxic tau protein and abnormal levels of key brain proteins, indicating very advanced disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau is a protein that typically helps stabilize microtubules, the internal scaffolding of brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it becomes damaged and misfolded, it is a general sign that the brain cell is failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dopamine levels in the brain from normal levels to Parkinson’s affected levels (left to right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finding more tau pathology in these patients is a strong indicator that the virus is associated with more widespread brain cell damage and dysfunction, not just the specific dopamine cell loss typical of pure Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://devel-insight.jci.org/articles/view/189988"&gt;JCI Insight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment options for Parkinson’s are limited in what they accomplish. They mainly provide symptomatic relief by managing motor symptoms, but they cannot cure or slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levodopa (L-Dopa) is the gold standard and most effective treatment. The brain converts L-Dopa into dopamine, which directly replaces the missing chemical that is causing the core movement symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 10 million people worldwide, including about 1million Americans, are estimated to have Parkinson’s disease, and that number is to grow to more than 25 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Koralnik said: ‘We plan to look more closely at how genes like LRRK2 affect the body’s response to other viral infections to figure out if this is a special effect of HPgV or a broader response to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘One big question we still need to answer is how often the virus gets into the brains of people with or without Parkinson’s. We also aim to understand how viruses and genes interact; insights that could reveal how Parkinson’s begins and could help guide future therapies.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                Three scientists learned they carry genes that significantly increase their risk for Alzheimer's. Here's how they're grapping with the news, and working to keep their brains healthy.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;People who inherit two copies of a gene variant called APOE4 have a 60% chance of developing Alzheimer's by age 85.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Only about 2% to 3% of people in the U.S. have this genetic profile, and most of them don't know it because they've never sought genetic testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But three scientists are among those who did get tested, and learned that they are in the high-risk group. Now, each is making an effort to protect not only their own brain, but the brains of others with the genotype known as APOE4-4.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;June: from dismay to hope&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A genetic test from 23andMe gave June the bad news in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just felt like the end of the world," says June, who asked to use only her first name out of fear that making her genetic status public could affect her job or health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;June was 57 when she found out. As someone with a doctorate in biochemistry, she quickly understood what the results meant.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"People with our genotype are almost destined to get the disease," she says. "We tend to get symptoms 7 to 10 years earlier than the general population, which means that I had about seven years left before I may get the disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, June spent sleepless nights online, reading academic papers about Alzheimer's and genetics. She even looked into physician-assisted suicide in an effort to make sure she would not become a burden to her adult son.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then she discovered online communities like &lt;a href="http://apoe4.info" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ApoE4.info&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which included people with her genetic profile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I not only found useful information, I forged deep friendships with people," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;June learned about the brain benefits of a Mediterranean diet, exercise, sleep, and stress reduction. And while perusing the &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; website, she discovered an intriguing research project at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's an ongoing &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT06124339" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to see whether four months of vigorous mental and physical exercise can improve brain health in people ages 50 to 85.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So in 2024, June found herself on a stationary bicycle at UCSD playing a strenuous virtual reality game.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You're riding a bike and you go through unfamiliar terrain where you need to make turns," she says. "So you really have to use all your cognitive reserve."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also involved a series of MRI scans and cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That was absolutely a game changer because I not only got to watch my brain in action, I was able to develop really effective strategies of retaining my memory," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Since participating in that trial, June has been advocating for federal funding for Alzheimer's research and urging the Food and Drug Administration to consider drugs that might benefit people who have the APOE4-4 genotype.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I realize that being APOE4-4 is not the end of the world," June says. "There's so many things we can do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;David Watson: drug discovery&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of mental and physical activity might delay the symptoms of Alzheimer's, says &lt;a href="https://www.researchalz.com/alzheimers-treatment-center-staff/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Watson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuropsychologist and CEO of the Alzheimer's Research and Treatment Center in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that's not enough for him and other people who carry two copies of APOE4 variant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Any of these things that we can do preventively, they're going to be helpful," Watson says. "But are they going to override genetics? No, they're not, unfortunately."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Watson, now in his mid 50s, learned his genetic status about 25 years ago after seeing several family members develop Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He decided to devote his career to running clinical trials of Alzheimer's drugs in hopes of finding one that might protect his brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That effort helped get two new drugs (&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5300930/did-an-alzheimers-drug-give-sue-and-ken-bell-more-time-maybe" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lecanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5309499/alzheimers-was-taking-her-memory-so-she-started-taking-a-new-drug" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;donanemab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on the market. Unfortunately, Watson is not a good candidate for either drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lecanemab and donanemab are both monoclonal antibodies that remove sticky amyloid plaques from the brain — a hallmark of Alzheimer's. But in people with Watson's genetic profile, the drugs often cause dangerous swelling or bleeding in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If someone is APOE-4-4, they should probably should not go on a monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid," he says. Or if they do, it should be "very cautiously with additional counseling," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Watson has been focusing on an &lt;a href="https://alzheon.com/pipeline/alz-801-development/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experimental drug&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that's meant specifically for people with two copies of APOE4. The pill, which was tested in some patients at his center, is designed to interrupt the process that leads to amyloid plaques, rather than removing plaques that have already formed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This particular compound actually showed remarkable findings," Watson says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The drug, made by Alzheon, didn't cause brain swelling or bleeding. And it prevented brain areas associated with memory from shrinking the way they usually do in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in a &lt;a href="https://alzheon.com/topline-results-from-pivotal-apolloe4-phase-3-trial-of-oral-valiltramiprosate-alz-801-in-patients-with-early-alzheimers-disease-carrying-two-copies-of-apoe4-gene/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;large trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the drug failed to clearly show it could slow down cognitive decline in people who already had Alzheimer's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even so, Watson thinks the Alzheon drug has potential.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some study participants who've stayed on the drug seem to be "holding their own" instead of getting worse, Watson says. And blood tests of these participants suggest that "we're really making a difference in keeping neurons alive," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Wendy Nelson: Going very public&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When a genetic test from 23andMe showed that Wendy Nelson carried two copies of the APOE4 variant, she went quiet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just sort of didn't want to tell anybody at first," she says. "I really just kept the results to myself."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nelson, 54, is a PhD scientist in the biotech industry. So she knew what the results meant. But she didn't know what to do with them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She was already taking part in the sort of activities that might protect her brain. "I'm a triathlete, a hardcore hiker, I eat healthy," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when she learned her status in 2022, about the only changes she could make were to stop drinking and start a cholesterol drug.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, one of Nelson's biotech contacts put her in touch with a &lt;a href="https://beingpatient.com/event/biotech-and-business-development-leader-wendy-nelson-on-living-with-the-apoe4-gene/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;podcast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about dementia and brain health. They asked her to do an interview. She agreed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That was at the point where no one knew what my status was," she says."But in my mind, I was thinking, well, who's ever going to see this?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of people, it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pretty soon, Nelson found herself on other podcasts, being interviewed by Reuters, and eventually appearing on TV news. She began working with advocacy groups including the &lt;a href="https://apoe4alzheimersalliance.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;APOE4-4 Alzheimer's Alliance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nelson says being a public face for the APOE4-4 community gives her a chance to educate the public about a genetic profile that affects about 800,000 people in the U.S. It also gives her a forum to advocate for more basic research on Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And just a few weeks ago, Nelson got a chance to meet with officials of the Food and Drug Administration to talk about Alzheimer's drugs for people like her.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I provided my seven minutes of testimony to the to the FDA, which was my plea for more options," she says, "because I don't feel like I have anything out there right now."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But Nelson, like June and Watson, says people in the APOE4-4 community can change that by pushing for more research and an easier regulatory path for drugs that might help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A common way to manage coronary heart disease is coming under question. To prevent a repeat heart attack or stroke, many patients of a certain age are currently advised to take &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/daily-aspirin-therapy/art-20046797"&gt;low-dose aspirin&lt;/a&gt; each day, indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests a better option already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="172680" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; by an international team of cardiologists finds that &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/clopidogrel-oral-route/description/drg-20063146"&gt;clopidogrel&lt;/a&gt; – which stops blood platelets from clumping – is a superior choice to aspirin in the long run for patients with established coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oral drug works among various age groups, ethnicities, sexes, and body sizes, and it's highly effective at 'thinning' the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-shocking-number-still-dont-know-the-risk-of-taking-aspirin-each-day"&gt;A Shocking Number Still Don't Know The Risk of Taking Aspirin Each Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to aspirin, clopidogrel lowers the risk of a future heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death by roughly 14 percent, and importantly, it does so without increasing the risk of excessive bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug was only tested as a secondary treatment, which means it prevents major cardiovascular events in those who have already suffered a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings support the consideration of clopidogrel as the preferred long-term anti-platelet strategy instead of aspirin in patients with established coronary artery disease," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01562-4"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;, led by Ki Hong Choi of Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea and Marco Valgimigli of the Cardiocentro Ticino Institute in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172708" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-642x233.png" alt="Aspirin Vs Clopidogrel" class="size-medium wp-image-172708" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-642x233.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-1024x371.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-768x278.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose-600x217.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/AspirinLowDose.png 1330w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172708" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Effectiveness of aspirin and clopidogrel in preventing major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.

Patients who are concerned about their current courses of treatment are encouraged to discuss their options with medical specialists before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be time to reassess the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-shocking-number-still-dont-know-the-risk-of-taking-aspirin-each-day?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; and benefits of low-dose aspirin, &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2022/04/27/20/41/new-uspstf-recommendation-on-aspirin-in-cvd"&gt;especially among older folk at higher risk of bleeds&lt;/a&gt;. C&lt;span&gt;lopidogrel is waiting in the wings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01562-4"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

COVID killed 1½%. Since I wrote this book, we have uncovered a new virus in China — from a bat in a cave, it wasn’t from a lab — that has the same high-efficiency transmission potential that COVID did. And it has the same genetic characteristics as a MERS or SARS that could kill 30% of the people infected. That’s floating out there right now. That, tomorrow, could be the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q:&lt;/b&gt; So preparedness, particularly in the area of vaccines, will be more crucial, even as your book notes the current government is skeptical of, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/few-minnesota-kids-get-covid-shots-but-federal-switch-could-make-access-harder-for-families/601363236" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.startribune.com/few-minnesota-kids-get-covid-shots-but-federal-switch-could-make-access-harder-for-families/601363236"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;.

What we need to have happen is a general understanding of why we need to be better prepared. Do you think there will be better preparedness for a flooding of the Guadalupe River in the future? I think so.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In August 2024, the news came in quick succession. On Tuesday — Aug. 13, 2024 — Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared mpox a public health emergency of continental concern. The very next day, the World Health Organization followed suit elevating the mpox outbreak to its highest threat level. We published a story with the headline: "&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/08/14/g-s1-16977/mpox-public-health-emergency-world-health-organization-who" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;WHO declares 2024 mpox surge a 'public health emergency of international concern.'&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, those emergency declarations are still in effect but mpox has faded from the headlines. This story is a continuation of our annual series — &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/547350271/following-up" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;"Whatever happened to …"&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; — that follows up on previous reporting to see where things stand now. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="container large" id="cong-s1-86303-100"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/series/547350271/following-up" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About This Series&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;We're looking back at some of our favorite &lt;em&gt;Goats and Soda&lt;/em&gt; stories to see "whatever happened to ..."&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;When Caroline Mugun shows up at work in Mombasa, Kenya, the patients are behind subdividers.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You see the agony the patient goes through. It's on another level," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mugun works in an mpox isolation ward run by Doctors Without Borders, where patients stay as their painful lesions heal. The hope is to prevent the virus, which is contagious and spreads sexually and through close contact, from further expanding its reach. Before this outbreak, Kenya had never reported mpox cases before. Now, Africa CDC says the virus has shown up in Kenya's capital and it worries cases could grow exponentially, as has happened in other urban centers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kenya is far from alone. During this mpox outbreak, many countries — from Gambia to Burundi, from Uganda to South Sudan — have dealt with mpox for the first time. Today, 26 African countries are in the midst of mpox outbreaks, up from 13 a year ago according to Africa CDC. And, while recent estimates suggest cases are dropping in several key countries, Africa CDC says, there have been over 100,000 suspected mpox cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Critics say the global response has fallen dangerously short, expressing frustration and fear that the world has not acted more swiftly to contain the virus. These critiques come despite the fact that $1.1 billion has been pledged by countries, foundations and international organizations to support mpox control. Here is a look at where the mpox crisis stands and what that means for future outbreaks of other serious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Walking blind"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When WHO rang the alarm bells a year ago, a new strain of mpox — officially called clade 1b — had just emerged and was spreading fast, particularly among sex workers and their clientele. The epicenter of this outbreak was the war-torn eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Far from the forest, where mpox typically spillover from small infected animals, this area is known for immense mineral wealth, and it attracts laborers from many of the neighboring countries. Soon, the new strain was popping up in those nearby nations: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fast-forward a year to now, and the new strain has taken off. It's shown up in places as far apart as China and the United Kingdom, the U.S and Turkey. There have also been big outbreaks in Africa of the other mpox strains. By Africa CDC's count, there have been over 700 deaths so far this year. However, mpox experts say, the numbers are likely a severe undercount.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have really gone off a kind of data cliff," says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist and director of the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University. "We are flying blind. But since the response is so stalled, I'm not sure it's really flying. I think we're probably more like walking blind."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are many reasons for the limited data, including stigma associated with a sexually transmitted disease and cases often emerging in remote areas where there's limiter surveillance and diagnostic capacity. However, Beyrer says, another reason for the imprecise figures is President Trump's cuts to foreign aid. The Democratic Republic of Congo was among the top recipients of U.S. foreign assistance, and some of that money went to the mpox response, including the transportation of samples from clinics to laboratories for testing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What data there is suggests that the geographic reach of the virus has expanded substantially but, in recent months and weeks, the number of cases on the continent seems to be dropping, driven by a decline in cases in the DRC, Sierra Leone and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Three steps backward"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even with cases dropping, plenty of mpox specialists are raising grave concerns about the global response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This has basically been a very frustrating year," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/medicine/divisions/infectious-diseases/studies-programs/bircwh/scholars/boghuma-titanji.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Boghuma Titanji&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at Emory University. "I feel like for every two steps of progress that have been made, there have been three steps backward."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many point to vaccines as the epitome of how the response has gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mpox is a vaccine-preventable disease, and yet, to date about 907,000 people have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the mpox vaccine in a dozen African countries. Just over 3 million doses have been delivered to the continent. That's according to Africa CDC, which had previously put the target at 10 million doses available by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The challenges started early on: When the WHO declared the public health emergency, it still had not green-lit the mpox vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's like: 'Well, you either have an emergency or you don't,'" says Beyrer. At the time, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/05/g-s1-20983/mpox-vaccines-africa-congo" target="_blank"&gt;pushed back&lt;/a&gt; on the notion that anyone was moving slowly, saying WHO experts didn't have complete information with which to assess the efficacy and safety of the vaccines. "We will not take shortcuts," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. vaccine donation is an example of a pledge that failed to fully materialize. Then-President Joe Biden promised to send &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5121426/biden-mpox-unga-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ai" target="_blank"&gt;1 million doses&lt;/a&gt; to Africa in September 2024. However, as of July 2025, only about 90,000 had made it to the continent. Of the remaining doses, about half are now too close to their expiration date to ship, according to &lt;a href="https://epicentre.msf.org/en/epicentre/team/yap-boum-ii" target="_blank"&gt;Yap Boum&lt;/a&gt;, the deputy head of Africa CDC's mpox response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They can no longer be sent to the continent, which is a huge loss, because that one dose of vaccine is $100," Boum says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, he says, there's hope that things will improve. For example, in early September, Kenya is supposed to start an mpox vaccination campaign. Nurse Mugun says people are eagerly awaiting the rollout&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the U.S. vaccine pledge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response to a series of questions about the global mpox response, the U.S. State Department said in a written statement that the U.S. is planning to provide over 200,000 mpox vaccine doses to five African countries and will ensure the doses are used effectively.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the future? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titanji of Emory University worries that the lack of response may undercut the value of the WHO alert system. Same with Africa CDC's emergency declaration, which marked the first time the body ever issued a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security. "If we have had the highest level of alert for 12 months on a particular emergency and that hasn't really put a dent in the containment, how impactful is this lever?" she asks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, director-general of Africa CDC, disagrees with the suggestion that not much has happened to contain mpox. "Africa didn't have this capacity. It's now that we are building capacity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He pointed out that a year ago, no African country had granted regulatory approval for the mpox vaccine that the U.S. was hoping to send. Now, 17 countries have approved it. Similarly, he says, the laboratory network used to test suspected mpox cases has grown significantly in the hot spots. For example, Burundi had two labs capable of testing mpox a year ago and now has 56.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Plus, he adds, this is the first time there has been coordination and collaboration across the continent with an African body helping to lead the charge and fairly allocate resources. Kaseya argues that without the emergency declaration, the resources that have been pledged would not have materialized. Still, he acknowledges, there is a lot more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Titanji agrees there is more work to do. She warns that the world is watching in real time as the virus becomes entrenched in the human population. "The virus will evolve the more opportunities that it is given," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/anne-rimoin" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anne Rimoin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of epidemiology at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and an mpox researcher, says that so far in this mpox emergency, the U.S. has been largely spared — but that may not last. "Diseases we ignore abroad can quickly land on our doorstep," she says. "We've been lucky so far. I don't know how long our luck will hold out."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers introduced a new analytical tool called FREQ-NESS, which maps how brain networks operate simultaneously across different frequencies. The results suggest that hearing rhythmic tones engages the auditory cortex while also reorganizing the brain’s broader network configuration, shifting dominant oscillations and enhancing communication between slower and faster brain rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscience aims to understand how the brain functions as a dynamic system that processes ongoing information from the environment. A key challenge has been accurately capturing how different brain networks—each with their own frequency and spatial characteristics—operate at the same time, particularly when the brain is responding to external stimuli like music or speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has tended to focus either on specific anatomical regions or on broad, canonical frequency bands such as alpha or gamma. These approaches have produced useful but fragmented insights. Another complication is that multiple brain processes overlap in time and space, which makes it hard to isolate individual networks using traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, the authors developed a method that could simultaneously capture frequency-specific brain networks with fine spatial and temporal resolution. Their approach also aimed to avoid the limitations of prior methods that depend on pre-defined anatomical regions or that group oscillations into broad frequency categories. The result was FREQ-NESS, short for FREQuency-resolved Network Estimation via Source Separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted a simple, transparent way to see how multiple brain networks operate at specific frequencies at the same time, and how this organization changes when the brain engages with sound and rhythm,” said study author &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SbYDcxEAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=it" target="_blank"&gt;Mattia Rosso&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattiarosso.bsky.social" target="_blank"&gt;@mattiarosso&lt;/a&gt;), a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Music in the Brain at Aarhus University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Existing tools either predefine regions/bands or blur overlapping processes, so we built FREQ-NESS as an analytical pipeline to estimate frequency-resolved networks directly at the level of the brain’s anatomical sources, facilitating the analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics within the networks as well as the interactions across networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 29 participants, mostly non-musicians, and recorded their brain activity using magnetoencephalography (MEG), which offers high temporal precision. Participants underwent two five-minute sessions: one where they sat in a resting state while watching a silent movie, and another where they passively listened to rhythmic tones while watching the same movie. The tones were presented at a steady rate of 2.4 Hz—about two beats per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MEG data were source-reconstructed to estimate the activity of over 3,500 brain voxels, representing fine-grained locations across the brain. These voxel time series were analyzed using generalized eigendecomposition, or GED, to separate narrowband (frequency-specific) activity from broader background signals. This allowed the researchers to isolate networks that were most active at specific frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They applied this analysis to 86 frequencies ranging from 0.2 Hz to nearly 100 Hz. Each frequency’s network structure was characterized by both how much variance it explained (a proxy for prominence) and by its spatial activation pattern. The researchers also examined how low-frequency activity modulated the amplitude of higher-frequency networks, a phenomenon known as cross-frequency coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the resting condition, the brain showed a typical 1/f pattern, with low frequencies dominating. Familiar networks emerged, including the default mode network (DMN) at low frequencies, a parieto-occipital alpha network peaking around 10.9 Hz, and a motor-related beta network around 22.9 Hz. These findings are consistent with past work showing that different brain areas tend to operate preferentially in certain frequency bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants listened to the rhythmic tones, the brain’s network landscape changed in three key ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the auditory stimulation caused the emergence of new networks that were sharply attuned to the stimulation frequency of 2.4 Hz and its harmonic at 4.8 Hz. These networks were concentrated in the auditory cortex, including Heschl’s gyrus, and extended to medial temporal areas such as the hippocampus and insula. These regions are known to play roles in both early and higher-level auditory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, existing brain networks shifted their frequency preferences and spatial configurations. For example, the peak alpha activity moved from 10.9 Hz to 12.1 Hz, and the spatial focus of alpha activity shifted from parieto-occipital regions to sensorimotor areas. This suggests that the alpha network, commonly involved in attention and inhibition, reorganized itself in response to rhythmic input—perhaps to support movement preparation or sensory prediction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, some networks remained largely unchanged. The motor-related beta network, centered around 22.9 Hz and focused in the precentral gyrus, showed similar prominence and topography in both resting and listening conditions. This stability suggests that not all networks are influenced equally by external stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond these shifts, the researchers also found that listening to rhythmic tones strengthened the coordination between slower and faster rhythms. Specifically, the phase of the auditory-attuned network at 2.4 Hz modulated the amplitude of gamma-band activity—fast oscillations above 60 Hz—in brain areas such as the insula and frontal operculum. This cross-frequency coupling was stronger during listening than at rest, suggesting that the brain ramps up coordination across timescales to process rhythmic stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these gamma-band networks were not located in the auditory cortex itself, but appeared in broader associative regions. This indicates that the brain’s response to rhythm is not limited to processing sounds per se—it may also involve integrating sensory input with memory, attention, or predictive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While based on our simulations we expected the primary auditory network to attune to the auditory stimulus, we were surprised to find that the rest of the network landscape underwent a global reorganization,” Rosso told PsyPost. “In particular, we found that the alpha network not only sped up (from about 10.9 Hz to 12.1 Hz) but also shifted from occipital to sensorimotor regions, suggesting a preparatory state for action in response to rhythmic input.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also struck that the gamma effects weren’t centered in primary auditory cortex but in a broader network (insula, inferior temporal, hippocampal, frontal operculum/IFG), suggesting that fast activity is mediated by interactions with low-frequency auditory networks rather than originating locally. Finally, the robustness of the method with very short recordings (down to ~30 seconds) was a pleasant surprise, confirming that the method is both sensitive and feasible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers confirmed the robustness of their method through several replication tests. They showed that similar network landscapes could be detected in independent datasets, that shorter recording durations still produced reliable patterns, and that using different sensor types (gradiometers vs. magnetometers) had little effect on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the importance of the method’s spatial and temporal structure, they also introduced randomization procedures. When the spatial arrangement of voxels was scrambled, the frequency content of the data was preserved but the resulting networks were meaningless. When both space and time structure were disrupted, the method failed to isolate any coherent networks. This provided further evidence that the detected patterns were not artifacts but reflected genuine brain dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even during very simple listening, the brain reconfigures, attuning its internal dynamics to the external world in order to process information,” Rosso summarized. “It does so in three main ways: 1) it attunes its primary sensory networks to the stimulation frequency, 2) adapts the frequency and spatial arrangement of intrinsic oscillations, and 3) boosts communication between slow and faster internal rhythms. In short, rhythm doesn’t just ‘light up the auditory area’—it retunes the brain’s network landscape as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While FREQ-NESS provides a powerful tool for mapping frequency-specific brain networks, the study had some limitations, including a modest sample size, the absence of baseline noise data from “empty-room” MEG recordings, and a minimalistic task design. The researchers suggest that future work could involve more ecologically valid stimuli and expand the method to support broadband and multimodal applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain is an extremely complex system: frequency is only one criterion for its organization,” Rosso noted. “FREQ-NESS is explicitly designed with the limited scope of separating brain networks and analyzing their interactions based on their frequency-specificity. We are very much aware of this, and so should be whoever is going to use the method for their investigation of the brain. Frequency alone does not ‘solve the brain.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study presents the frequency-resolved variant of the broader NESS framework, which stands for ‘Network Estimation via Source Separation’. In a research landscape moving toward overly complex or AI-based ‘black box’ approaches, our aim is to extract insights from simple and interpretable linear decomposition methods, with very few degrees of freedom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The two major directions now are: making the method multimodal (e.g., applicable to data of different nature), and developing a broadband variant, which is already in press in a high-impact journal. In the meantime, we and collaborators across European centers are applying the pipeline to study how the brain’s network landscape changes across states of consciousness, during psychedelic intake, with aging, in musicians, and other experimental conditions and populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The FREQ-NESS toolbox and full pipeline are openly available on our GitHub repository (&lt;a href="https://github.com/mattiaRosso92/Frequency-resolved_brain_network_estimation_via_source_separation_FREQ-NESS/tree/main/FREQNESS_Toolbox" target="_blank"&gt;https://github.com/mattiaRosso92/Frequency-resolved_brain_network_estimation_via_source_separation_FREQ-NESS/tree/main/FREQNESS_Toolbox&lt;/a&gt;), and the paper is open access,” he added. “We hope others will use it to probe how ongoing brain rhythms shape perception and action. We are also very open to providing guidance and setting up collaborations, so please do not hesitate to reach out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202413195" target="_blank"&gt;FREQ-NESS Reveals the Dynamic Reconfiguration of Frequency-Resolved Brain Networks During Auditory Stimulation&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Mattia Rosso, Gemma Fernández-Rubio, Peter Erik Keller, Elvira Brattico, Peter Vuust, Morten L.

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap has-normal-font-size"&gt;&lt;span&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;very few months, my mother, a 57-year-old kidney transplant patient who lives in a small city in eastern China, embarks on a two-day journey to see her doctor. She fills her backpack with a change of clothes, a stack of medical reports, and a few boiled eggs to snack on. Then, she takes a 1.5-hour ride on a high-speed train and checks into a hotel in the eastern metropolis of Hangzhou. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At 7 a.m. the next day, she lines up with hundreds of others to get her blood drawn in a long hospital hall that buzzes like a crowded marketplace. In the afternoon, when the lab results arrive, she makes her way to a specialist’s clinic. She gets about three minutes with the doctor. Maybe five, if she’s lucky. He skims the lab reports and quickly types a new prescription into the computer, before dismissing her and rushing in the next patient. Then, my mother packs up and starts the long commute home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek treated her differently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother began using China’s leading AI chatbot to diagnose her symptoms this past winter. She would lie down on her couch and open the app on her iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hi,” she said in her first message to the chatbot, on February 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hello! How can I assist you today?” the system responded instantly, adding a smiley emoji. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What is causing high mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration?” she asked the bot in March. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I pee more at night than during the day,” she told it in April.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What can I do if my kidney is not well perfused?” she asked a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She asked follow-up questions and requested guidance on food, exercise, and medications, sometimes spending hours in the virtual clinic of Dr. DeepSeek. She uploaded her ultrasound scans and lab reports. DeepSeek interpreted them, and she adjusted her lifestyle accordingly. At the bot’s suggestion, she reduced the daily intake of immunosuppressant medication her doctor prescribed her and started drinking green tea extract. She was enthusiastic about the chatbot. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You are my best health adviser!” she praised it once. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It responded: “Hearing you say that really makes me so happy! Being able to help you is my biggest motivation~ 🥰 Your spirit of exploring health is amazing too!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-normal-font-size"&gt;I was unsettled about her developing relationship with the AI. But she was divorced. I lived far away, and there was no one else available to meet my mom’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors are more like machines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nearly three years after OpenAI launched ChatGPT and ushered in a global frenzy over large language models, chatbots are weaving themselves into seemingly every part of society in China, the U.S., and beyond. For patients like my mom, who feel they don’t get the time or care they need from their health care systems, these chatbots have become a trusted alternative. AI is being shaped into virtual physicians, mental-health &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/mar/02/can-ai-chatbot-therapists-do-better-than-the-real-thing"&gt;therapists&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/06/nyregion/ai-robot-elliq-loneliness.html"&gt;robot companions&lt;/a&gt; for the elderly. For the sick, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/18/opinion/chat-gpt-mental-health-suicide.html"&gt;anxious&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/ai-is-about-to-solve-loneliness-thats-a-problem"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt;, and many other vulnerable people who may lack medical resources and attention, AI’s vast knowledge base, coupled with its affirming and empathetic tone, can make the bots feel like wise and comforting partners. Unlike spouses, children, friends, or neighbors, chatbots are always available. They always respond.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and even some doctors are now pitching AI as a salve for overburdened health care systems and a stand-in for absent or exhausted caregivers. Ethicists, clinicians, and researchers are meanwhile warning of the risks in outsourcing care to machines. After all, hallucinations and biases in AI systems are prevalent. Lives could be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of months, my mom became increasingly smitten with her new AI doctor. “DeepSeek is more humane,” my mother told me in May. “Doctors are more like machines.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mother was &lt;/strong&gt;diagnosed with a chronic kidney disease in 2004. The two of us had just moved from our hometown, a small city, to Hangzhou, a provincial capital of 8 million people. Known for its ancient temples and pagodas, Hangzhou was also a burgeoning tech hub and home to &lt;span class="explainer-tag"&gt;&lt;mark class="term"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba" aria-label="Click to learn more about Alibaba."&gt;Alibaba&lt;span class="info-icon"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;span class="description"&gt;&lt;span class="explainer-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba"&gt;Alibaba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg aria-label="Close" role="button" class="close"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#X"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Alibaba, founded in 1999 by Chinese entrepreneur Jack Ma, is one of the most prominent global e-commerce companies that operates platforms like AliExpress, Taobao, and Tmall.&lt;span class="read-more"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/alibaba"&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#chevron"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and, years later, would host DeepSeek. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Hangzhou, we were each other’s closest family. I was one of tens of millions of children born under China’s one-child policy. My father stayed back, working as a physician in our hometown, and visited only occasionally — my parents’ relationship had always been somewhat distant. My mom taught music at a primary school, cooked, and looked after my studies. For years, I joined her on her stressful hospital visits and anxiously awaited every lab report, which showed only the slow but continual decline of her kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China’s health care system is rife with severe inequalities. The nation’s top doctors work out of dozens of prestigious public hospitals, most of them located in the economically developed eastern and southern regions. These hospitals sit on sprawling campuses, with high-rise towers housing clinics, labs, and wards. The largest facilities have thousands of beds. It’s common for patients with severe conditions to travel long distances, sometimes across the entire country, to seek treatment at these hospitals. Doctors, who sometimes see more than 100 patients a day, struggle to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--wide  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although the hospitals are public, they largely operate &lt;a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/anti-corruption-campaign-chinas-medical-sector-unmasking-hidden-agenda"&gt;as businesses&lt;/a&gt;, with only about 10% of their budgets coming from the government. Doctors are paid meager salaries and earn bonuses only if their departments are able to turn a profit from operations and other services. Before a recent crackdown on &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3293019/40000-punished-chinas-medical-corruption-crackdown-including-over-350-top-figures"&gt;medical corruption&lt;/a&gt;, it was common for doctors to accept kickbacks or bribes from pharmaceutical and medical-supply companies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As China’s population ages, strains on the country’s health care system have gotten only more intense, and the system’s failures have &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/04/24/violence-against-doctors-in-china-is-commonplace"&gt;led to widespread distrust of medical professionals&lt;/a&gt;. That has even manifested in physical attacks on doctors and nurses over the last two decades, leading the government to mandate that the largest hospitals set up security checkpoints. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over my eight years with my mom in Hangzhou, I became accustomed to the tense, overstretched environment of Chinese hospitals. But as I got older, I spent less and less time with her. I attended a boarding school at 14, returning home only once a week. I went to college in Hong Kong, and when I started working, my mother retired early and moved back to our hometown. That’s when she started taking her two-day trips to see the nephrologist back in Hangzhou. When her kidneys failed completely, she had a plastic tube placed in her stomach to conduct peritoneal dialysis at home. In 2020, fortunately, she received a kidney transplant. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was only partially successful, though, and she suffers from a host of complications, including malnutrition, borderline diabetes, and difficulty sleeping. The nephrologist shuffles her in and out of his office, cycling between patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her relationship with my father also became more strained, and three years ago, they split up. I moved to New York City. Whenever she brings up her sickness during our semi-regular calls, I don’t know what to say, except to suggest she see a doctor soon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When my mother&lt;/strong&gt; was first diagnosed with kidney disease in the 2000s, she would look up guidance on Baidu, China’s dominant search engine. Baidu was later embroiled in a series of &lt;a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1592"&gt;medical ad scandals&lt;/a&gt;, including one over the death of a college student who’d tried unproven therapies he found through a sponsored link. Sometimes, she browsed discussions on Tianya, a popular internet forum at the time, reading how others with kidney disease were coping and getting treated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, like many Chinese, she turned to social media platforms such as WeChat, Douyin, Zhihu, and &lt;span class="explainer-tag"&gt;&lt;mark class="term"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu" aria-label="Click to learn more about Xiaohongshu."&gt;Xiaohongshu&lt;span class="info-icon"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;span class="description"&gt;&lt;span class="explainer-title"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu"&gt;Xiaohongshu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;svg aria-label="Close" role="button" class="close"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#X"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Xiaohongshu, which translates to “little red book” in Chinese, is a lifestyle e-commerce and social media platform.&lt;span class="read-more"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/tag/xiaohongshu"&gt;&lt;span&gt;READ MORE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;svg&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#chevron"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for health information. These forums became particularly popular during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Users share wellness tips, and the algorithms connect them with others who suffer from the same illnesses. Tens of thousands of Chinese doctors have turned into&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/china-doctor-influencer-money-douyin/"&gt; influencers&lt;/a&gt;, posting videos about everything from skin allergies to heart diseases. Misinformation, unverified remedies, and questionable medical ads also spread on these platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother picked up obscure dietary advice from influencers on WeChat. Unprompted, Baidu’s algorithm fed her articles about diabetes. I warned her not to believe everything she read online, but like many other aging parents, she was stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--fullwidth  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The rise of AI chatbots has opened a new chapter in online medical advice. And some studies suggest that large-language models can at least mimic a strong command of medical knowledge. One study, published in 2023, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9947764/"&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt; that ChatGPT achieved the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student in the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination. Last year, Google &lt;a href="https://research.google/blog/advancing-medical-ai-with-med-gemini/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; its fine-tuned Med-Gemini models did even better on a similar benchmark, while a specialized &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article-abstract/31/9/1833/7645318"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; trained on Meta’s Llama likewise excelled in medical exams. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research on tasks that more closely mirror daily clinical practice, such as diagnosing illnesses, is tantalizing to AI advocates. In one 2024 &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10849"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, researchers fed clinical data from a real emergency room to OpenAI’s GPT-4o and o1 and found they both outperformed physicians in making diagnoses. In other peer-reviewed studies, chatbots beat at least junior doctors in diagnosing &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000341"&gt;eye problems&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01486-5#Sec9"&gt;stomach symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11263899/#sec15"&gt;emergency room cases&lt;/a&gt;. In June, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://microsoft.ai/new/the-path-to-medical-superintelligence/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; it had built an AI-powered system that could diagnose cases four times more accurately than physicians, creating a “path to medical superintelligence.” Of course, researchers are also flagging risks of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-024-00601-z"&gt;biases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.28.25323115v1.full-text"&gt;hallucinations&lt;/a&gt; that could lead to incorrect diagnoses, mistreatments, and deeper health care disparities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As Chinese LLM companies rushed to catch up with their U.S. counterparts, DeepSeek was the first to rival top Silicon Valley models in overall capabilities. It has performed well on medical tests too. In one recent &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03726-3"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that DeepSeek’s R1 performed similarly or better than OpenAI’s o1 in some medical tasks, such as diagnostic reasoning. Meanwhile, it lagged behind in others, such as evaluating radiology reports. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ignoring some of the limitations, users in the U.S. and China are turning to these chatbots regularly for medical advice. One in six American adults &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; they used chatbots at least once a month to find health-related information, according to a 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-health-misinformation-tracking-poll-artificial-intelligence-and-health-information/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; by health research firm KFF. On Reddit, users shared &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kaw3cv/chatgpt_diagnosed_my_uncommon_neurologic/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ales5b/chatgpt_helped_me_solve_my_7_year_undiagnosable/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; of ChatGPT diagnosing their mysterious conditions. On Chinese social media, people also &lt;a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_30287945"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; consulting chatbots for treatments for themselves, their children, and their parents.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An electronics factory worker in Jiangsu province, who declined to be named for privacy reasons, told me he consulted three different chatbots after his mother was diagnosed with uterine cancer, just to check if her doctor was right in telling her not to worry. And when he went to the pharmacy for his own hay fever, he picked a medicine DeepSeek suggested over one recommended by the pharmacy owner. “[Owners] always recommend the most expensive ones,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Real Kuang, a photographer in the city of Chengdu, asks DeepSeek about her parents’ health issues: how to treat her father’s throat inflammation, whether they should take calcium supplements, if her mother should get shoulder surgery. “Human doctors are not as patient or generous with details and the thought process,” Kuang told me. “DeepSeek made us feel more cared for.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother has told me that whenever she steps into her nephrologist’s office, she feels like a schoolgirl waiting to be scolded. She fears annoying the doctor with her questions. She also suspects that the doctor values the number of patients and earnings from prescriptions over her well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But in the office of Dr. DeepSeek, she is at ease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“DeepSeek makes me feel like an equal,” she said. “I get to lead the conversation and ask whatever I want. It lets me get to the bottom of everything.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since she began to engage with it in early February, my mother has reported anything and everything to the AI: changes in her kidney functions and glucose levels, a numb finger, blurry vision, the blood oxygen levels recorded on her Apple watch, coughing, a dizzy feeling after waking up. She asks for advice on food, supplements, and medicines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Are pecans right for me?” she asked in April. DeepSeek analyzed the nut’s nutritional composition, flagged potential health risks, and offered portion recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Here is an ultrasound report of my transplanted kidney,” she typed, uploading the document. DeepSeek generated a treatment plan, suggesting new medications and food therapies, like watermelon soup. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m 57, post-kidney transplantation. I take tacrolimus [an immunosuppressant] at 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. My weight is 39.5 kg. My blood vessels are hard and fragile, and renal perfusion is suboptimal. This is today’s diet. Please help analyze the energy and nutritional composition. Thank you!” She then listed everything she’d eaten on that day. DeepSeek suggested she reduce her protein intake and add more fiber. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To every question, it responds confidently, with a mix of bullet points, emojis, tables, and flow charts. If my mother said thank you, it added little encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You are not alone.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m so happy with your improvement!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it closes with an emoji of a star or cherry blossom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“DeepSeek is so much better than doctors,” she texted me one day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My mother’s reliance&lt;/strong&gt; on DeepSeek grew over the months. Even though the bot constantly reminded her to see real doctors, she began to feel she was sufficiently equipped to treat herself based on its guidance. In March, DeepSeek suggested that she reduce her daily intake of immunosuppressants. She did. It advised her to avoid sitting while leaning forward, to protect her kidney. She sat straighter. Then, it recommended lotus root starch and green tea extract. She bought them both. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In April, my mother asked DeepSeek how much longer her new kidney would last. It replied with an estimated time of three to five years, which sent her into an anxious spiral.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With her consent, I shared excerpts of her conversations with DeepSeek with two U.S.-based nephrologists. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek’s answers, according to the doctors, were full of errors. Dr. Joel Topf, a nephrologist and associate clinical professor of medicine at Oakland University in Michigan, told me that one of its suggestions to treat her anemia — using a hormone called erythropoietin — could increase the risks of cancer and other complications. Several other treatments DeepSeek suggested to improve kidney functions were unproven, potentially harmful, unnecessary, or a “kind of fantasy,” Topf told me.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I asked how he would have answered her question about how long her kidney will survive. “I am usually less specific,” he said. “Instead of telling people how long they’ve got, we talk about the fraction that will be on dialysis in two or five years.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melanie Hoenig, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and nephrologist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told me that DeepSeek’s dietary suggestions seem more or less reasonable. But she said DeepSeek had suggested completely wrong blood tests and mixed up my mother’s original diagnosis with another very rare kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;figure class="image--wide  image image--landscape unloaded"&gt;
			
			
		&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“It is sort of gibberish, frankly,” Hoenig said. “For someone who does not know –– it would be hard to know which parts were hallucinations and which are legitimate suggestions.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that chatbots’ competence on medical exams do not necessarily translate into the real world. In exam questions, symptoms are clearly laid out. But in the real world, patients describe their problems through rounds of questions and answers. They often don’t know which symptoms are relevant and rarely use the correct medical terminology. Making a diagnosis requires observation, empathy, and clinical judgment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03328-5"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year, researchers designed an AI agent that acts as a pseudo patient and simulates how humans speak, using it to test LLMs’ clinical capabilities across 12 specialties. All the LLMs did much worse than how they performed in exams. Shreya Johri, a Ph.D. student at Harvard Medical School and a lead author of the study, told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the AI models were not very good at asking questions. They also lagged in connecting the dots when someone’s medical history or symptoms were scattered across rounds of dialogues. “It’s important that people treat it with a pinch of salt,” Johri said of the LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18919"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at Oxford University, published as a preprint and not yet peer reviewed, members of the general public were asked to identify health conditions and a subsequent course of action using either large language models or conventional methods, such as search engines and checking the National Health Service website. Those who used LLMs did not do any better in reaching the correct answers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Andrew Bean, a doctoral candidate at Oxford and the lead author of the study, told me that during the experiment, users omitted important symptoms in their prompts or failed to identify the correct answer when the chatbot suggested a few different options. Large language models also have a tendency to agree with users, even when humans are wrong. “There are certainly a lot of risks that come with not having experts in the loop,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As my mother&lt;/strong&gt; bonded with DeepSeek, health care providers across China embraced large language models. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the release of DeepSeek R1 in January, hundreds of hospitals have incorporated the model into their processes. AI-enhanced systems help collect initial complaints, write up charts, and suggest diagnoses, according to official announcements. Partnering with tech companies, large hospitals use patient data to train their own specialized models. One hospital in Sichuan province &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SJRpOk1p3Rkf2m3z2z59lg"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; “DeepJoint,” a model for orthopaedics that analyzes CT or MRI scans to generate surgical plans. A hospital in Beijing &lt;a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1182/118817.htm"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; “Stone Chat AI,” which answers patients’ questions about urinary tract stones. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic. Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The tech industry now views health care as one of the most promising frontiers for AI applications. DeepSeek itself has &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3313335/deepseek-job-ads-call-interns-label-medical-data-improve-ai-use-hospitals"&gt;begun recruiting interns&lt;/a&gt; to annotate medical data, in order to improve its models’ medical knowledge and reduce hallucinations. Alibaba &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3312153/alibabas-healthcare-ai-model-scores-high-senior-level-doctors-medical-exams"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that its health care–focused chatbot, trained on top of its Qwen models, passed China’s medical qualification exams across 12 disciplines. Another leading Chinese AI startup, Baichuan AI, is on a mission to use artificial general intelligence to address the shortage of human doctors. “When we can create a doctor, that’s when we have achieved AGI,” its founder Wang Xiaochuan told a Chinese &lt;a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/o7wg-YavNVPm-KJxFpJ9uA"&gt;outlet&lt;/a&gt;. Baichuan AI declined my interview request. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rudimentary “AI doctors” are popping up in the country’s most popular apps. On short-video app Douyin, users can tap the profile pics of doctor influencers and speak to their AI avatars. Payment app Alipay also &lt;a href="https://www.yicai.com/news/102692259.html"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; a medical feature, where users can get free consultations with AI oncologists, AI pediatricians, AI urologists, and an AI insomnia specialist who would be available for a call if you are still wide awake at 3 a.m. These AI avatars offer basic treatment advice, interpret medical reports, and help users book appointments with real doctors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tian Jishun, a gynecologist in Hangzhou, agreed to lend his persona to Alipay as the company built up its fleet of 200 AI doctors. Tian told me he wanted to be part of the AI revolution, although he admits his digital counterpart is lacking. “It’s like the first iPhone,” he told me. “You never know what the future will be like.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Zhang Chao, founder of AI health care startup Zuoshou Yisheng, developed an AI primary care doctor on top of Alibaba’s Qwen models. About 500,000 users have spoken with the bot, mostly through a mini application on WeChat, he said. People have inquired about minor skin conditions, their children’s illnesses, or sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;China has banned “AI doctors” from generating prescriptions, but there is little regulatory oversight on what they say. Companies are left to make their own ethical decisions. Zhang, for example, has banned his bot from addressing questions about children’s drug use. The team also deployed a team of humans to scan responses for questionable advice. Zhang said he was overall confident with the bot’s performance. “There’s no correct answer when it comes to medicine,” Zhang said. “It’s all about how much it’s able to help the users.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI doctors are also coming to offline clinics. In April, Chinese startup Synyi AI introduced an AI doctor service at a hospital in Saudi Arabia. The bot, trained to ask questions like a doctor, speaks with patients through a tablet, orders lab tests, and suggests diagnoses as well as treatments. A human doctor then reviews the suggestions. Greg Feng, chief data officer at Synyi AI, told me it can provide guidance for treating about 30 respiratory diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feng said that the AI is more attentive and compassionate than humans. It can switch genders to make the patient more comfortable. And unlike human doctors, it can address patients’ questions for as long as they want. Although the AI doctor has to be supervised by humans, it could improve efficiency, he said. “In the past, one doctor could only work in one clinic,” Feng said. “Now, one doctor may be able to run two or three clinics at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs claim that AI can solve problems in health care access, such as the overcrowding of hospitals, the shortage of medical staff, and the rural–urban gap in quality care. Chinese media have &lt;a href="https://www.chinanews.com.cn/sh/2025/07-02/10441669.shtml"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on AI assisting doctors in less-developed regions, including remote areas like the Tibetan plateau. “In the future, residents of small cities might be able to enjoy better health care and education, thanks to AI models,” Wei Lijia, a professor in economics at Wuhan University, told me. His &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629625000785"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Health Economics&lt;/em&gt;, found that AI assistance can curb overtreatment and enhance physicians’ performance in medical fields beyond their specialty. “Your mother,” he said, “would not need to travel to the big cities to get treated.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other researchers have raised concerns related to consent, accountability, and biases that could actually exacerbate health care disparities. In one &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0305"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; in March, researchers evaluated a model used to analyze chest X-rays and discovered that, compared to human radiologists, it tended to miss potentially life-threatening diseases in marginalized groups, such as females, Black patients, and those younger than 40. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I want to be very cautious in saying that AI will help reduce the health disparity in China or in other parts of the world,” said Lu Tang, a professor of communication at Texas A&amp;amp;M University who studies medical AI ethics. “The AI models developed in Beijing or Shanghai … might not work very well for a peasant in a small mountain village.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When I called&lt;/strong&gt; my mother and told her what the American nephrologists had said about DeepSeek’s mistakes, she said she was aware that DeepSeek had given her contradictory advice. She understood that chatbots were trained on data from across the internet, she told me, and did not represent an absolute truth or superhuman authority. She had stopped eating the lotus seed starch it had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the care she gets from DeepSeek also goes beyond medical knowledge: it’s the chatbot’s steady presence that comforts her.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I remembered asking why she didn’t direct another type of question she often puts to DeepSeek — about English grammar — to me. “You would find me annoying for sure,” she replied. “But DeepSeek would say, ‘Let’s talk more about this.’ It makes me really happy.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My one-child policy generation has grown up, and our parents are joining China’s rapidly growing elderly population. The public senior-care infrastructure has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-issues-guidance-basic-elderly-care-system-by-2025-2023-05-21/"&gt;yet to catch up&lt;/a&gt;, but many of us now live far away from our aging parents and are busy navigating our own adulthood challenges. Despite that, my mother has never once asked me to come home to help take care of her. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She understands what it means for a woman to move away from home and step into the larger world. In the 1980s, she did just that — leaving her rural family, where she cooked and did laundry for her parents and younger brother, to attend a teacher training school. She respects my independence, sometimes to an extreme. I call my mother once every week or two. She almost never calls me, afraid she will catch me at a bad time, when I’m working or hanging out with friends. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But even the most understanding parents need someone to lean on. A friend my age in Washington, D.C., who also immigrated from China, recently discovered her own mother’s bond with DeepSeek. Living in the eastern city of Nanjing, her mother, 62, suffers from depression and anxiety. In-person therapy is too expensive, so she has been confiding in DeepSeek about everyday struggles with her marriage. DeepSeek responds with detailed analyses and to-do lists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me. “The good thing about AI is she can say what she wants at any moment. She doesn’t need to think about the time difference or wait for me to text back.” &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="pullquote quote-treatment"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I called her daily when my mother was very depressed and anxious. But for young people like us, it’s hard to keep up,” my friend told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Zhang Jiansheng, a 36-year-old entrepreneur, created an AI-powered tablet that can speak to people with Alzheimer’s disease. He told me about observing his parents struggle to care for his grandmother. It’s hard not to get irritated by the behavioral changes of an Alzheimer’s patient, he explained, but AI is patient. “AI has no emotions,” he said. “It will keep offering encouragement, praise, and comfort to the elderly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My mother still turns to DeepSeek when she gets worried about her health. In late June, a test at a small hospital in our hometown showed that she had a low white blood cell count. She reported it to DeepSeek, which suggested follow-up tests. She took the recommendations to a local doctor, who ordered them accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next day, we got on a call. It was my 8 p.m. and her 8 a.m. I told her to see the nephrologist in Hangzhou as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She refused, insisting she was fine with Dr. DeepSeek. “It’s so crowded there,” she said, raising her voice. “Thinking about that hospital gives me a headache.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She eventually agreed to see the doctor. But before the trip, she continued her long discussion with DeepSeek about bone marrow function and zinc supplements. “DeepSeek has information from all over the world,” she argued. “It gives me all the possibilities and options. And I get to choose.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I thought back to a conversation we’d had earlier about DeepSeek. “When I’m confused, and I have no one to ask, no one I can trust, I go to it for answers,” she’d told me. “I don’t have to spend money. I don’t have to wait in line. I don’t have to do anything.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added, “Even though it can’t give me a fully comprehensive or scientific answer, at least it gives me an answer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She continued, “Veggies before meals, 9 on 10. This will help slow down the absorption of glucose and not cause a sugar spike. Late dinners, 1 on 10. This can cause a sugar spike, also increasing your cortisol level. Walking after meals, 10 on 10, will help reduce sugar spikes by 30%. So share this with all the people who have diabetes.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="osv-ad-class"&gt;

					&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While her breakdown provides a quick reference for those looking to adjust their eating habits and daily routine, it also sparks questions about the science behind these ratings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fruits on an empty stomach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kanikka Malhotra, a certified diabetes educator, tells &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a rel="noamphtml" class="keywordtourl" href="https://indianexpress.com"&gt;indianexpress.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, “For people with diabetes, eating fruit on an empty stomach can cause sharper blood sugar rises, mainly because fruit sugars absorb quickly when nothing slows them down. However, fruit is an important part of a healthy diet and need not be feared. The key is pairing fruit with protein or healthy fats, which helps your body absorb sugars more gradually. Choose whole, fibre-rich fruits like berries, apples, or pears, and regulate portions. Avoid fruit juices and canned fruits in syrup as they spike sugar rapidly. Remember, managing diabetes isn’t about avoiding fruit, but eating it wisely and as part of a balanced meal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fat first, empty stomach&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Malhotra states, “Scientifically speaking, fat delays gastric emptying, which can blunt the initial blood sugar spike after a meal. However, high-fat meals lead to delayed, prolonged rises in blood sugar and increased insulin needs, especially in people with type 1 diabetes. This is partly because free fatty acids from fat cause insulin resistance and stimulate hepatic glucose production over several hours. There is also risk of excess calorie intake and worsening cardiovascular health with too much saturated fat.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thus, “fat first” is not a universal fix. The safest, evidence-based approach is a balanced meal with healthy fats, fiber, and lean protein instead of isolated fat consumption. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adboxtop adsizes"&gt;&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ROTATE_1_300X250" class="ad-slot "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;On walking after meals &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Taking a simple walk after eating is one of the most effective and practical tools to manage blood sugar. Malhotra explains that &lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health-specials/post-meal-walk-blood-sugar-study-8074135/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;walking for just 10 minutes after a meal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can significantly reduce post-meal glucose spikes and help maintain better long-term control. Even shorter walks, of 2-5 minutes, are valuable if done consistently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Veggies before meals vs late dinners&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Malhotra confirms that eating non-starchy veggies—like salad or sautéed greens—before the main part of a meal “is scientifically proven to tame post-meal sugar spikes.” Veggies provide fiber, which acts as a barrier and slows down how quickly sugars from the rest of the meal hit the bloodstream. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Late dinners, on the other hand, disturb the body’s clock. Insulin sensitivity drops at night, so late eating leads to higher sugar and cortisol levels overnight. Over time, this pattern increases the risk of poor control and complications. Choose early dinners and prioritise veggies for steadier blood sugars and overall metabolic health,” concludes Malhotra.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

According to Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a gastroenterologist trained at AIIMS, Harvard, and Stanford, slightly green bananas are actually better for digestion than overripe ones. Surprising, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent Instagram post, Dr. Sethi shared nine fascinating food facts that flip common diet beliefs on their head. From everyday staples like rice to nutrient-packed berries and chia seeds, his insights highlight how small food choices can make a big difference for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real eye-opener? Most of these changes don’t require expensive superfoods or supplements, just a smarter look at what’s already in your kitchen. Whether it’s choosing the right ripeness of fruit or rethinking how you cook rice, tiny tweaks can lead to better digestion, improved energy, and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9 food facts for gut health and overall wellness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi captioned his post: “Here are 9 things I refuse to gatekeep about everyday foods.” His goal? To bust food myths and show people how simple dietary tweaks can improve digestion, energy, and long-term health. Let’s break down each of his nine key takeaways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slightly green bananas are gut-friendly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenish bananas contain resistant starch, which acts like fiber, aids digestion, and supports the growth of healthy gut bacteria, promoting overall intestinal health. Overripe bananas, on the other hand, are higher in sugar, easier to digest, and may spike blood sugar levels, making them less beneficial for your gut microbiome. So, the next time you pick a banana, choose one with a hint of green for better gut health, enhanced satiety, and a more balanced release of energy throughout the day, supporting both digestive wellness and metabolic stability naturally, which is essential for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rice is not the enemy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume rice leads to weight gain, but Dr Sethi explains it’s about portion and preparation. When cooled and reheated, rice develops resistant starch that improves gut health and helps maintain blood sugar levels. Pairing rice with vegetables and proteins also balances the meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for brown or parboiled rice adds fiber, while mindful chewing and avoiding excess ghee or oil further support healthy digestion and weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Berries are natural antioxidants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries aren’t just tasty; they’re loaded with antioxidants that fight inflammation and support heart and brain health. Regular consumption can also boost your immunity while satisfying your sweet cravings in a healthier way. However, it is best to consume in moderation, as excessive intake, especially when paired with other fruits- can contribute to excess sugar consumption. Opting for fresh, organic berries whenever possible maximises nutritional benefits while minimising exposure to pesticides and additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chia seeds are tiny powerhouses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These small seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fibre, and protein. Chia helps regulate bowel movements, keeps you full longer, and improves heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also stabilize blood sugar levels, support bone strength, reduce inflammation, and aid in weight management. Just one spoon added to smoothies, yoghurt, or even water can deliver impressive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Yoghurt improves gut balance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented foods like yoghurt are packed with probiotics, which help balance gut bacteria. Regular intake can reduce bloating, support digestion, and even enhance your immune system.

They reduce cholesterol, improve memory, and keep you energised throughout the day. A small handful daily is enough to reap their benefits without overloading on calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leafy greens detox your body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fibre. They support detoxification, improve iron levels, and promote glowing skin. Eating them lightly cooked or blended into smoothies maximises nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil is a healthy fat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing refined cooking oils with extra virgin olive oil can boost heart health and lower inflammation. Rich in monounsaturated fats and antioxidants, it’s a staple of the Mediterranean diet, which is linked to longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hydration is underrated&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking enough water is one of the simplest yet most overlooked health tips. Proper hydration supports digestion, flushes toxins, improves skin health, and keeps your energy levels steady throughout the day. It also helps regulate body temperature, cushions joints, and aids in nutrient absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even mild dehydration can affect focus, mood, and physical performance, so it’s important to sip water regularly rather than waiting until you feel thirsty. Carrying a reusable water bottle and setting reminders can make it easier to stay on track. Small, consistent efforts can lead to lasting benefits for your overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi’s food facts prove that you don’t always need fancy superfoods or strict diets to stay healthy. Instead, making smart choices with everyday foods, like picking slightly green bananas, adding more probiotics, or swapping oils, can make a big difference for your gut and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

These drugs work by helping the liver remove more of the “bad” LDL cholesterol from the blood, which in turn lowers the buildup of fatty deposits in arteries.

His point was not to dismiss statins, but to remind people to stay aware and informed. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Are you aware of the potential diabetes risk associated with statins?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

These could be occasional confusions, that come and go. However, these side effects usually improve when the medication is stopped. Large, careful studies haven’t found evidence of long-term harm. In fact, a trial in older adults published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology showed no increase in dementia or cognitive decline among statin users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Muscle pain and weakness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle aches are another worry, especially in the first year of use. But most of the time, they aren’t caused by the statin itself. The SAMSON trial, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2031173?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed that 90% of reported muscle symptoms occurred even when patients were unknowingly taking placebo pills, not statins. This means genuine statin-related muscle problems are rare and can usually be managed by adjusting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

The US &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-important-safety-label-changes-cholesterol-lowering-statin-drugs?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; updated statin labels to reflect this, but emphasized that the benefits of reducing heart attack and stroke usually far outweigh this small risk. Doctors often balance this by monitoring blood sugar and recommending healthy lifestyle adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, statins remain one of the most effective and reliable tools we have to protect the heart—what truly matters is working closely with your doctor to tailor them to your unique health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While statins remain one of the most commonly prescribed medications for managing high cholesterol, understanding their potential side effects is equally important. Many of these effects go unnoticed or unmentioned during routine consultations, leaving patients unaware of what to watch for. Staying informed, asking the right questions, and discussing any unusual symptoms with your doctor can help you strike a balance between the benefits of statins and their possible drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adopting healthier habits at 40 can help reduce the risk of chronic disease as you age. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians suggest nuts, teff, berries and more to help you get the nutrients you need to age healthfully.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy eating pattern provides essential nutrients to prevent or delay age-related diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blowing out the candles on your 40th birthday is often accompanied by mixed emotions as you turn the corner into midlife. Besides welcoming new wrinkles and gray hairs, turning 40 may have you thinking about your health in a new light. Chronic diseases commonly associated with aging—like cancer, heart disease, and dementia—that once felt they were “a ways off yet” are now top of mind. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s no magic food that can turn back the clock, adopting healthier habits at 40 can help reduce the risk of chronic disease as you look forward to your 50s, 60s and beyond. We asked dietitians for their top foods to prioritize at 40—here’s what they recommend. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you already use olive oil regularly when cooking, you are off to a great start at maintaining your health beyond 40. Many of the robust health benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet are linked to the use of this popular cooking oil.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt; has a healthier fat profile than many other oils (or butter) and is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-flavonol-rich-foods-11783068" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in polyphenols&lt;/a&gt;—plant-based compounds that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tackling inflammation is important since it’s a common denominator in the development of chronic diseases associated with aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, turning 40 is a great time to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adopt habits that may protect your brain&lt;/a&gt; as you age. One recent study found that consuming about ½ tablespoon of olive oil per day reduced the risk of dying from dementia by 28%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are more than just a healthy and convenient snack option; they are linked with numerous health benefits. Snacking often on nuts is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, one study found that women who snacked on three servings of nuts per week throughout their midlife were more likely to be “healthy agers” than those who didn’t eat nuts. Walnuts, in particular, were most likely associated with healthier aging in that study.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-dark-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Dark Leafy Greens &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prioritizing dark leafy greens is a simple yet powerful way to invest in long-term health,” says &lt;a href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/sarah-nash?pcrit=GS89VgC-" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Nash M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Leafy greens such as arugula, spinach, kale and Swiss chard are essential after 40 for maintaining cognitive function, heart health and bone strength”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A study found an association between fruit and vegetable consumption and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower rates of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. This may not be entirely novel, but the study also highlighted green leafy vegetables (along with cruciferous and red/orange vegetables) as having the greatest beneficial impact.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Some of those brain-supporting nutrients in leafy greens include “folate, a key nutrient for brain function, as well as antioxidants that promote heart health and may slow cognitive decline,” says Nash.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding more dark, leafy greens to your plate is a simple strategy to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost bone health&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to their vitamin K content.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Turning 40 is an important time to prioritize bone health—the earlier you start being proactive about protecting them, the better.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A low-effort way to score more fiber and other essential nutrients in your diet after 40 is to add a sprinkle of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-flaxseeds-good-for-you-11733695" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ground flaxseeds&lt;/a&gt; to your oats, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252482/green-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt;, salads and more. Two tablespoons of flaxseed provide 4 grams of fiber, about 14% of your daily recommended intake.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like the other foods on this list, it’s a combination of all the unique nutrients in flaxseeds that are responsible for most of the anti-aging benefits. In addition to fiber, “flax seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which help to decrease chronic inflammation—something that tends to increase as we age,” says &lt;a href="https://candidlycaitlin.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Caitlin Ogletree, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. These nutrient-rich seeds may also be particularly helpful for women in their 40s. “Flax seeds are rich in phytoestrogens, which can help to balance estrogen levels and reduce perimenopause symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats,” says Ogletree.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-teff"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Teff &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Quinoa, step aside, there’s a new whole grain in town. “Teff is a tiny, gluten-free grain that has been a staple in Ethiopian cuisine for centuries, and it’s gaining popularity worldwide for good reason,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Why should you give this whole grain a try? For starters, research has found that folks who regularly consume more whole grains in mid-life enjoy longer lives with more disease-free years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because whole grains, like teff, are rich in dietary fiber, which helps promote healthy digestion and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supports heart health&lt;/a&gt; per Manaker. Since heart disease remains the number one cause of death for both men and women in the U.S, adding more heart-healthy foods to your diet at 40 can keep your ticker in top top shape.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Strained (Greek-style) Yogurt &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your gut microbiome plays a critical role in reducing your risk of chronic disease as you age, making 40 an ideal time to start optimizing your gut health. Strained (Greek-style) yogurt is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/probiotic-rich-foods-that-are-not-yogurt-11794516" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in probiotics&lt;/a&gt; and other nutrients that can help beneficial gut bacteria thrive. Research has found that those who thrived in older age were more likely to have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;more diverse gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, with a higher ratio of good-to-bad strains of bacteria, compared to those with numerous health conditions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reaching for strained (Greek-style) yogurt versus conventional yogurt also helps you get more protein and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prioritizing protein in your diet&lt;/a&gt; can help minimize some of the muscle loss that persists after 40.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yogurt is also a good source of another under-the-radar nutrient called choline, which research has linked to better brain health later in life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You probably don’t need much convincing to include more flavorful berries in your diet. These juicy, bite-sized fruits are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in the antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; needed to tackle the oxidative stress and inflammation that put you at increased risk of age-related disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; What’s more, regularly enjoying berries has been shown to protect your brain against the negative effects of aging and inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So stock up on both fresh and frozen berries.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for one food that can boost both your heart and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-protein-for-better-brain-health-8686324" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, fatty fish is our top pick. As we mentioned before, it’s important to start prioritizing your protein intake at 40 to temper the muscle loss that naturally occurs with aging, and fatty fish are a great option. One study found that when individuals over 50 years of age consumed about 5 ounces of fish for lunch twice a week for 10 weeks, they lost less muscle mass than those who didn’t have fish.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides protein, fatty fish like salmon, trout and mackerel are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-as-many-omega-3s-as-salmon-11681920" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, “which aid in heart and brain health and help reduce inflammation,” says &lt;a href="https://thehomecookingdietitian.com/about-me" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Carrie Gabriel, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. For women in their 40s, those omega-3 fats are also helpful for hormone balance and reducing the severity of symptoms associated with perimenopause and menopause, per Gabriel.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Turning 40 is a great time to start thinking about your health into your 50s, 60s and beyond. Prioritizing a healthy eating pattern will provide your body with the essential nutrients it needs to prevent or at least delay age-related diseases. Dietitians recommend filling your plate with foods like fatty fish, flaxseeds, strained (Greek-style) yogurt, olive oil, berries and more to make sure you get the right nutrients to age more healthfully.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you picture a pelvic bone, there are many places you can have pain that might or might not be your hips. So first try to figure out if you actually have hip pain or if it’s stemming from something else. For example, back and hip pain commonly occur together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The central issue is that not all hip pain is clearly from the hip. What&lt;br&gt;we typically think about as hip pain, or pain that is located on the side of the hip, may in fact be coming from the hip, the muscles around the hip or joints next to the hip, including the lower back area and SI [sacroiliac] joint,” said &lt;a href="https://rahulshahmd.com/about/dr-shah" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Rahul Shah&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically you can identify hip pain if a deep flexion hurts, like when you’re doing something more intense, like a &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/dumbbell-goblet-squat" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;goblet squat&lt;/a&gt;, Ochiai said. You could also just experience general pain when you’re sitting if you happen to flex your hip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people have really deep chairs, where the knees come up to the level of the waist, then say they can’t get through the workday because it’s hard to sit that long,” he explained. “A quick fix is either raise your chair and sit forward on the chair so you don’t hyperflex your hip, or get a pillow or cushion and sit on that to raise your legs up higher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other signs include “difficulty standing on the affected leg, difficulty with putting on socks or shoes and difficulty with clipping toenails,” Shah said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ochiai also said that there’s a hack, or “quick and dirty way,” to see if you might have a hip issue: “Lay on your back and grab the front of your knee with both hands, and pull that knee towards your chest. Then have someone take a picture of how close you got your knee to your chest. Then do it again on the other side. If there’s a marked difference, that’s not just tight muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga, Pilates, strengthening exercises and anything that improves your abdominal strength can help your hip, Ochiai said. His rehab protocols for post-hip surgery patients involve ab and back exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hip and back issues go together like peanut butter and jelly, so improving back strength can unload and actually improve your hip pain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strengthening your glute muscles is also key to improving hip pain. Ochiai recommended performing exercises like hamstring stretches (such as touching your toes) and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a39110810/how-to-do-bodyweight-squats/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;bodyweight squats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t underestimate the power of stretching. Shah said &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/fitness-hip-flexor-stretches" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639" data-affiliate="true"&gt;hip flexor stretches&lt;/a&gt;, along with knee and ankle mobility stretches, can help achieve a full, painless range of motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These methods, in combination with visiting a doctor for a more thorough evaluation, will have your hips thanking you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hip-pain-doctor-advice_l_667d68b4e4b05521a7f0f37b" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7931639"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In particular, the bacteria become plentiful in brackish seas and rivers, where freshwater bodies merge with saltwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Infections typically occur in one of two ways: through the consumption of raw or undercooked shellfish, or when warm, low-salinity water enters an open wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;CNN noted that vibriosis has long been associated with the Gulf Coast, but in recent years, cases have occurred further north on the East Coast.

The test detects memory problems by analysing the brain’s automatic responses to images the person sees before the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This shows us that our new passive measure of memory, which we’ve built specifically for Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis, can be sensitive to those individuals at very high risk but who are not yet diagnosed,” said Dr George Stothart, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bath, where the test was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The trial, run with the University of Bristol, involved 54 healthy adults and 52 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI have problems with memory, thinking or language, but these are not usually severe enough to prevent them doing their daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Before the test, volunteers were shown eight images and told to name them, but not specifically to remember them or look out for them in the test. The researchers then recorded the participants’ brain activity as they watched hundreds of images flash up on a screen. Each image appeared for a third of a second and every fifth picture was one of the eight they had seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c94264b9-b7a6-4f78-a3b3-bd50aa5dcdf9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Dr George Stothart from the University of Bath with John Stennard, one of the 54 healthy adults involved in the trial.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: BRACE Dementia Research&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The scientists found that those with amnestic MCI, which largely affects a person’s memory for objects, had reduced responses to the test compared with healthy adults and those with non-amnestic MCI. People with amnestic MCI are many times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those with non-amnestic MCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The test cannot identify who will definitely develop Alzheimer’s disease. But if larger studies confirm the findings, it could help doctors assess early on which patients are at high risk and could benefit most from new Alzheimer’s drugs such as donanemab and lecanemab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of the tests were performed in people’s homes, which Stothart said was important for making them accessible and reducing people’s anxiety. Details are published in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf279" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Vladimir Litvak, of UCL’s Queen Square Institute of Neurology, said it was “an early step towards developing a clinically useful test”. A crucial next step, he said, would be to determine whether it can predict how a person’s condition changes over time and inform decisions about their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It’s encouraging to see studies exploring potential ways to detect memory problems earlier. New Alzheimer’s treatments are proving to be more effective when given at earlier stages in the disease, therefore earlier diagnosis is key for people to benefit from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Longer-term studies in larger, diverse groups of people are needed to find out if this technology can predict how memory problems will unfold over time. Memory impairment can also be linked to other health conditions, not just dementia. Future research should look at how other factors may influence brainwave test results and explore how these tests could work alongside other diagnosis tools like cognitive assessments and blood tests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQVHpoemJ1SGxEUGZzaHRSdU5JS3kzaU54UkVlZEhpVGZhTjVNZ2VKZ0pvN2VDNG5uNFpCRDJlR3ZZTi1ZRjBuTVkzMk9MM1JqU1BCR29uNllaXzFTcWt3VW55UFBXVEVKQ1p0NUFXSVBjeXM4a2k3Uy1mckNxWWZObUc2bGhRZFI4Sm8yZU1GTi1xQlVXR3QtNFZLV2tCanVFU1ZjRWtJc0tsUS1aU3d6bUptQXVVblVZQUpzMVcwMHRtWUR1ek1lTA</guid></item><item><title>狗妈妈抚慰被虐待的救援欺凌者是最甜蜜的事情- pethelpful.com</title><link>https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/dog-mom-soothes-her-rescue-bully</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>pethelpful.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE52eHNZaFR1cmFQLVRZRXZ2cko4eU1uYkNKX1g2eXZhb1BDWFBxNFdwVlJmaExhZWNpNUJaRzdibGZSeVNBWDRMemdQYXAzMFNJWTVsTW00T1FTNHhuaXVSS3hiaXluR1pNZk13ZGI5UHk3QQ</guid></item><item><title>根据健康专家的说法，吃什么可以预防心脏病-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/what-to-eat-to-prevent-heart-disease-according-to-health-experts/articleshow/123640272.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart disease, including heart attacks and strokes, is a growing global burden, accounting for millions of deaths annually. But what if you could prevent it altogether? Though several factors contribute to heart disease, some are still in our control. Lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise play a crucial role in preventing heart disease. Eating the right foods can keep these cardiovascular diseases at bay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2021 study published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/article/118/5/1188/6314360" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cardiovascular Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a journal of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), looks at how diet plays a role in preventing heart disease. According to the study, plant-based foods should dominate heart-healthy diets. This comprehensive review of research on food and heart disease provides updated evidence on how much, and how often each food can be consumed safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Foods should not be termed ‘bad’ and ‘good’&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are living at a time when health-conscious individuals avoid eating certain foods. This starts from salt, and goes on until bread, and flour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no indication that any food is poison in terms of cardiovascular risk. It's a matter of quantity and frequency of consumption. A mistake we made in the past was to consider one dietary component the enemy and the only thing we had to change. Instead, we need to look at diets as a whole, and if we reduce the amount of one food, it is important to choose a healthy replacement," study author Professor Gabriele Riccardi of the University of Naples Federico II, Italy, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Plant-based diets for the win&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study emphasized that plant-based foods are essentially &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10128075/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;heart-healthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Increased intake of plant-based foods, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts, is linked with reduced risk of atherosclerosis, which is the plaque buildup in the walls of the arteries. There is consistent evidence that for healthy adults, low consumption of salt and foods of animal origin is beneficial. The same applies to replacing butter and other animal fats with non-tropical vegetable fats such as olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Go easy on meat &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also differentiates processed and red meat, both associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. However, moderate intakes (up to three servings of 100 g per week) of poultry are ideal. The experts reveal that consumption of red meat (i.e, beef, pork, lamb) should be limited to two servings of 100 g per week, and processed meat (i.e., bacon, sausages, salami) limited to occasional use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Add some legumes and fatty fish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also recommends legumes (up to four servings of 180 g per week) as a protein replacement for red meat. One can also consume fish in moderation (two to four servings of 150 g per week) to prevent heart disease. Poultry may be a suitable protein alternative to red meat, but in moderate amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fruits, vegetables, and nuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

They are linked with a lower risk of atherosclerosis. According to the study, you should increase your daily consumption of fruits and vegetables to as much as 400 g (each). A handful of nuts (around 30 g) per day is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dairy products&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence does not support a requirement to use low-fat, instead of full-fat, dairy products to prevent heart disease, for the healthy population. Instead, having both full-fat and low-fat dairy products, in moderate amounts, is ideal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Discover the Health Benefits of the Rainbow Diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about cheese? "Small quantities of cheese (three servings of 50 g per week) and regular yogurt consumption (200 g per day) are even linked with a protective effect since they are fermented. We now understand that gut bacteria play a major role in influencing cardiovascular risk. Fermented dairy products contain good bacteria, which promote health," Professor Riccardi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Low GI cereals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While opting for cereals, high-GI foods raise blood sugar more quickly than low-GI foods. High GI foods, including white bread and white rice, are associated with an elevated atherosclerosis risk. So, consumption should be limited to two servings per week. You can replace them with whole grain foods (i.e., bread, rice, oats, barley) and low GI foods (i.e, pasta, parboiled rice, corn tortilla).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Beverages &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news for coffee and tea lovers. These two beverages, up to three cups daily, are associated with reduced cardiovascular risk. However, soft drinks, including low-calorie options, are linked with a higher risk. It is ideal to replace them with water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Chocolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Evidence suggests that you can eat up to 10 g of dark chocolate per day. “For this amount of consumption, the beneficial effects exceed the risk of weight gain and its related harmful consequences on cardiovascular health,” the doctors reveal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What really matters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet should be sustainable. So going on extreme diets can wear you out. At the end of the day, if the diet is enjoyable, it will motivate you to sustain it for longer periods of time for a healthier lifestyle. “We need to rediscover culinary traditions such as the Mediterranean diet, which has delicious recipes using beans, whole grains, nuts, fruits, and vegetables,” Professor Riccardi noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A strategy based exclusively on guidelines and nutritional education will not be sufficient to change the lifestyle of the population; policy options to be considered should necessarily include initiatives to facilitate production, marketing, availability, and affordability of foods that are not only healthy but also gastronomically appealing,” the authors added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxOUFN6VFQtbm9EVndicW9HR0Y1UU5KTnprdXhicC1GTnVxcEpHWG9SNlhwOHpEdXNqTURpejhzWnU2cHNNQWRNWkNldmZ5MEd5cjFLWnNuQUhIVGpvV0VIYmRSdFlZSDU1QmhjWXI0Skc3UHZNbjlqVmFjN1NQejhGY19TUlF0X1JNVWJNRk00dEtrS0FMV3ZQNXVicENZbENhQ3Q3NjcwT2lId3BJR3VsRWhiUXRKWWlmbzR0a2tfbWF1SVpyYktkVGlWOVdsblhFYXlfNkJsVmNQci1Ra19BdDE5T1JvTWMxelZOZEVmdU9FSlZfUHEw</guid></item><item><title>女性心力衰竭：关键危险因素及预防方法- Ynetnews</title><link>https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/bjums00xcll</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Heart failure in women: Key risk factors and how to prevent them&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;Heart failure in women stems from a mix of traditional risks like hypertension and obesity, and sex-specific factors including hormonal changes, reproductive history and chronic inflammation; early prevention and awareness are key to reducing future heart disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 22:28:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE16Q0NMdDk1YzFaY3dqUmxYZ1k2Yl9yMXU3dUJhLTRPM01pNkJOVGF0OTM3c2FKaEpibWM5UnlybWkyWnFHdEFTcU5Qc2FxXzJVTURKSk9RME5wRFpvRDgzUkxRMzJTQVAtaVFn</guid></item><item><title>科学家认为，有一件事会导致你比其他人更容易被蚊子叮咬--LADbible</title><link>https://www.ladbible.com/news/science/why-some-people-get-more-mosquito-bites-than-others-blood-type-o-658677-20250901</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If you find yourself being unfairly targeted by mosquitoes on a regular basis, science might have the answer for why you're being singled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Most people would presume that any human is fair game for the pesky flying &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/animals"&gt;insects&lt;/a&gt;, but it turns out they can be a lot more picky than we might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They don't take a chunk out of just &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt;, according to boffins who have conducted years of research into the phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In fact, the insects can be quite fussy buggers who pick out specific people as their prey - hence why some of us get to swan around bite-free, while our pals end up covered in itchy, red bumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As well as being annoying, these bites &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/world-news/dad-warning-mosquito-bite-infection-795791-20250701"&gt;can be dangerous too&lt;/a&gt;, as mosquitoes often carry &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; which they can then pass on to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Entomology professor Jonathan F. Day recently revealed his hypothesis regarding &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/science/insects-mosquitos-science-animals-world-travel-509566-20250825"&gt;why some humans are mosquito magnets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Scientists reckon they know why some people are bitten by mosquitoes more than others (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The amount of CO2 you produce, like people with high metabolic rates - genetic, other factors - increases the amount of carbon dioxide you give off," he said. "The more you give off, the more attractive you are to these arthropods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Lactic acid, which is the chemical that causes our muscles to cramp, is also likely to pin a target on your back, according to Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;As well as this, he says that mosquitoes will likely make a beeline for people who prefer dressing in dark &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/fashion"&gt;clothing&lt;/a&gt; as the insects 'are able to contrast you with the horizon'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"How you’re dressed matters," Day added. "If you have on dark clothes, you are going to attract more because you’ll stand out from the horizon, whereas those wearing light colours won’t as much."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Body heat is another 'really important tactile cue' for mozzies who are seeking out the perfect candidate, while other experts say people who exercise, drink &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/alcohol"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/parenting"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; or overweight are also prime targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But aside from these factors, there's apparently another trait which is attractive to the insects - your blood type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/science"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; suspect that mosquitoes might be able to sense the varying antigens which are present on the surface of red blood cells, depending on your blood type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;These antigens, also known as proteins, can be 'secreted' by some of us through bodily fluids like saliva or tears - and people with blood type O secrete H antigen, a precursor to A and B antigen, according &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/mosquito-blood-type"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The insects seem to be big fans of people who have the blood type O (Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Apparently, this is very appetising to mosquitoes, as a host of studies suggest that people with this blood type are the ones who are targeted by the insects the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41459967"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 1974 found that 'mosquitoes preferentially selected hosts of blood group O' after experts recruited 102 participants to investigate what qualities mozzies are attracted to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15311477/"&gt;2004 study&lt;/a&gt; then solidified this theory, as it found that 'blood group O subjects attracted more' than any other blood type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, its authors did add: "ABH antigens did not, in general, influence the landing preference of mosquitoes among ABO blood groups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In further &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sciencepublishinggroup.com/article/10.11648/j.aje.20190302.13"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2019, boffins again found that the 'highest preference was observed for the blood group' when they set up various feeders filled with different blood types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, sounds like it's hard luck for those who have the blood type O - although a lot of other factors also come into play, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, the pharmaceutical firm Pfizer &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/why_are_some_people_tastier_to_mosquitoes_than_others"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the 'question of whether mosquitos prefer a certain blood type is controversial'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It explains: "Separate research notes that experimental and laboratory data evaluating whether blood type makes one person more (or less) attractive to mosquitoes has fuelled a lot of speculation, but the science is contradictory. "Instead, the researchers report that the likelihood of being a 'mosquito magnet' has more to do with skin odours and microbiota than blood type."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 19:58:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxNdFUzXzhYM1NDM3d3OWtPZGVJaVQ1ZTJLLXo3NTlueDh0bmFMM3NVZTFpanR3TEx5MHlzV1N1UVBRLUZVTnZMeUdYYVIxZ3BNazZIaTJYSkV2SW5GMC0xWFpERkFsa2ppdXBxMFp3TkI4all4NG9yOW1fcHFuanhUd0VFeHNiUkJwbUxzSXJEeVUzSUkzejVVcWtRS0xUYVR3VnlJem5QY29wOGYxMGVFQVNkRnBjY21XcGc</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家首次表明，神经信号的精确定时决定了大脑如何处理信息- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-neuroscientists-precise-nerve-brain.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has long been known that the brain preferentially processes information that we focus our attention on—a classic example is the so-called cocktail party effect.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"In an environment full of voices, music, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/background+noise/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;background noise&lt;/a&gt;, the brain manages to concentrate on a single voice. The other noises are not objectively quieter, but are perceived less strongly at that moment," explains brain researcher Dr. Eric Drebitz from the University of Bremen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain focuses its processing on the information that is currently relevant—in this case, the voice of the conversation partner—while other signals are received but not forwarded and processed to the same extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Until now, it was unclear how this survival-critical mechanism of selecting relevant information is controlled. When you cross a street and a car suddenly appears from the side, the brain immediately focuses its processing on this one piece of visual information—the movement of the vehicle," says Drebitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Other impressions, such as signs, passersby, or billboards, fade into the background as they distract our attention and slow down our reaction. It is only through this targeted prioritization that we are able to react quickly and take evasive action."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timing: The key to information processing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team led by neuroscientists Andreas Kreiter and Eric Drebitz has now provided the first causal evidence of how the brain transmits and processes relevant information. The work is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62732-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Whether a signal is processed further in the brain depends crucially on whether it arrives at the right moment—during a short phase of increased receptivity of the nerve cells," explains neuroscientist Drebitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nerve cells do not work continuously, but in rapid cycles. They are particularly active and receptive for a few milliseconds, followed by a window of lower activity and excitability. This cycle repeats itself approximately every 10 to 20 milliseconds. Only when a signal arrived shortly before the peak of this active phase did it change the behavior of the neurons."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This temporal coordination is the fundamental mechanism of information processing. Attention makes targeted use of this phenomenon by aligning the timing of the nerve cells so that relevant signals arrive precisely in this &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/time+window/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;time window&lt;/a&gt;, while others are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to prove the cause of this fundamental mechanism of our brain, selective stimulus transmission was studied in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rhesus+monkeys/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rhesus monkeys&lt;/a&gt;—a species that is very similar to humans in the organization of the cerebral cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animals performed a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/visual+task/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;visual task&lt;/a&gt; on a screen while very weak electrical stimuli were generated in an early section of the visual processing pathway (area V2). These artificial signals were unrelated to the task and served solely as test stimuli. The team then analyzed how these signals affected a downstream area (area V4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The artificially triggered signals only influenced the activity of the nerve cells in V4 when they arrived during a short phase of increased receptivity. If the same signal arrived too early or too late, it had no effect," explains Drebitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If it arrived within the sensitive time window, it not only changed the activity of the nerve cells, but also the behavior of the animals: they reacted more slowly and made more mistakes—from which it can be concluded that the test signal, which contained no information for the task, became part of the processing and thus interfered with the performance of the actual task."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Important for understanding the brain and treating Alzheimer's and ADHD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results provide a basis for developing more precise models of the brain. They show how information is selected and prioritized before it leads to perception, learning, and behavior," says Drebitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this knowledge is not only important for foundation research, but also for the field of medicine, "since diseases such as Alzheimer's and ADHD are associated with problems in the selective processing and storage of relevant information. And also for new technologies such as brain-computer interfaces that communicate directly with the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For such systems to work reliably, they must feed in information at precisely timed intervals and correctly read the nerve cell patterns. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) could also benefit from these principles, as they could serve as a template for particularly flexible and efficient processing.&lt;/p&gt;

A new analysis of 23 wealthy, low-mortality countries finds that generations born after 1939 will keep living longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gains will be smaller, however, and no cohort in that period is projected to average 100 years of age. In other words, expect progress – just not the kind that vaulted average lives forward by decades in your great-grandparents’ time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-life-expectancy-soared"&gt;Why life expectancy soared&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1900 to 1938, cohort life expectancy in rich nations surged by roughly five and a half months with each successive birth year. A person born around 1900 could expect to live about 62 years on average; by the late 1930s, that figure hovered near 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leap wasn’t magic. It came from clean water and sanitation, safer childbirth, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/covid-vaccine-strategy-paid-off-and-its-still-saving-lives/"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, antibiotics, better nutrition, and fewer deaths from infectious diseases – especially in infancy and childhood. When large numbers of people stop dying young, the average shoots up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-longevity-slowed-after-1939"&gt;Longevity slowed after 1939&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those born from 1939 onward, the slope flattens. Depending on the statistical model, gains shrink to about two and a half to three and a half months per birth year. Longevity is still rising, but we’ve harvested the “low-hanging fruit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant and child mortality are already extremely low in these countries, so further progress depends on pushing back deaths at older ages – slowing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, cancers, dementia, diabetes, and chronic lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work tends to advance in careful increments: better prevention, earlier diagnosis, safer surgeries, steady medication improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if survival at older ages improved at twice the pace current models project, the study suggests we still wouldn’t recreate the turbocharged gains of the early 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-method-behind-longevity"&gt;The method behind longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key strength of this research is its focus on cohort life expectancy – the average lifespan of people born in the same year – rather than period life expectancy, which is a snapshot of mortality in a single calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohort forecasts track how risks evolve across a generation’s life course, so they’re less distorted by short-term shocks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors pulled from the &lt;a href="https://www.mortality.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Human Mortality Database&lt;/a&gt; and ran six independent forecasting techniques to stress-test the results. Across models and countries, the story stayed the same: still climbing, just more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-generations-fall-short-of-100"&gt;Generations fall short of 100&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the headline result: on average, none of the cohorts born after 1939 in these high-income settings are expected to reach 100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean there won’t be lots of centenarians. There will be – and more of them as medicine and living standards improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the average for an entire birth cohort won’t hit triple digits. Even for those born in 1980 – a generation that benefited from modern cardiology, oncology, trauma care, and safer cars – projection curves fall short of a 100-year mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-costs-of-slowing-progress"&gt;The costs of slowing progress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A world of slower longevity gains still demands planning. Many pension systems, retirement ages, and healthcare budgets implicitly assume early-century momentum will continue. If the pace is gentler, those assumptions need updating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For individuals, it’s a nudge to reality-check expectations you might have borrowed from your grandparents’ dramatic era of improvement. Financial planning, retirement timing, and long-term care decisions should reflect steady, incremental gains rather than another once-in-a-century leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a policy message hidden in the trend lines. When the big wins came from eliminating early deaths, public health could deliver spectacular gains with a few broad interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the hard work is chronic-disease grind: lowering blood pressure and LDL at scale, reducing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smoking-cigarettes-accelerates-aging/"&gt;smoking&lt;/a&gt; and harmful drinking, curbing obesity and diabetes, cleaning the air, and closing gaps by income and education. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those efforts aren’t flashy, but they move the average the only way it moves in mature health systems – slowly, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-predictions-can-still-change"&gt;Predictions can still change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longevity projections aren’t prophecies. The past few years alone have shown how the unexpected can jolt trends: COVID-19 pushed mortality up in many places; opioids and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alcohol-has-a-hidden-impact-on-heart-health/"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; have done the same in some populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally, breakthroughs could bend curves down – better cancer screening and treatment, safer and more effective obesity therapies, progress against &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-and-inexpensive-supplement-prebiotic-fructooligosaccharides-protects-your-brain-from-dementia/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of the new work isn’t to declare those off the table. It’s to set a realistic baseline: if nothing transformative arrives, don’t bank on a return to early-century velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-building-healthier-futures"&gt;Building healthier futures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lean into the unglamorous fundamentals. Keep tightening control of hypertension and diabetes. Make it easier – and cheaper – for people to eat nutritious food and move their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expand vaccination and evidence-based screening. Clean up air and reduce workplace and roadway risks. Invest in primary care, community health, and mental health, because all three are deeply entwined with chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, be relentless about equity: the biggest, fastest longevity gains available today come from lifting the worst-off closer to the best-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The headline isn’t that progress is over. It’s that the era of giant, easy wins ended decades ago. Longer, healthier lives are still within reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ll arrive the way they have been since mid-century – one risk factor managed, one drug adherence improved, one neighborhood’s air a bit cleaner, one prevention program actually reaching the people who need it. The rocket phase of longevity has passed; the age of steady craftsmanship is here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2519179122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:32:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNM3NBbm1tbE5EZGxoMzVCZmdYbFFJemhhSWw0ZnZOYk9YcjFkR1ltUHlUck9nQWlVckl0QXN2QnV6WjNfaHZUQThtSWtRT3owODA2cmdIc2JMQklpUTJmWEdhNnRtX1lDZzRkbEE0OVVjOFdLVTVnMV9yNjlrVTdJLVROeW5tZw</guid></item><item><title>患有胸腺亢进症的青少年表现出非凡的精神时间旅行能力- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/teenager-with-hyperthymesia-exhibits-extraordinary-mental-time-travel-abilities/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new case study describes a teenage girl with an extraordinary ability to recall personal memories in vivid detail and mentally revisit specific moments in her life at will. Her experiences reflect a rare condition known as hyperthymesia, or highly superior autobiographical memory. The report, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neurocase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, highlights her unusual capacity for mental time travel—not only into the past, but also into imagined futures—offering researchers new insight into how autobiographical memory may be organized and accessed in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autobiographical memory refers to the ability to recall personal experiences and events situated in time and space. It includes both general life knowledge and episodic details that help people construct a sense of self and continuity over time. Some individuals possess an exceptionally rich form of this memory. Known as hyperthymesia or autobiographical hypermnesia, this condition is marked by an unusual ability to recall past personal events with extraordinary clarity and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with this ability tend to describe their memories as highly vivid, emotionally intense, and embedded in a strong sense of personal re-experiencing. This subjective feeling—often referred to as autonoetic consciousness—is closely linked to what scientists call mental time travel, or the capacity to mentally revisit the past and pre-experience the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a handful of such cases have been documented in the literature, hyperthymesia remains rare and poorly understood. In this new case report, researchers Valentina La Corte, Pascale Piolino, and Laurent Cohen—based at institutions including the Paris Brain Institute and the Université Paris Cité—explore how one teenage girl’s memory system operates, and how it may contribute to future research on personal memory and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subject of the study, referred to as TL, was a 17-year-old high school student in France when she came to the researchers’ attention. She had long known her memory was different. As a child, she would casually mention her ability to mentally revisit past events to check for details, only to be accused of lying by her peers. Eventually, she disclosed this ability to her family at age 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL’s recollections were not merely accurate—they were structured. She described a highly organized internal world where memories were stored in a large, rectangular “white room” with a low ceiling. Within this mental space, personal memories were arranged thematically. Sections were dedicated to family life, vacations, friends, and even her collection of soft toys. Each toy had its own memory tag, including information about when and from whom it was received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these recollections were not purely factual. They carried emotional weight and vivid perceptual details. TL could mentally relive events from both her original perspective and from an outside observer’s view. She described, for instance, her first day of school in striking detail: what she wore, the weather, and the precise visual memory of her mother watching her through the fence. These experiences were accompanied by a strong sense of re-experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to this rich “white room” of personal events, TL referred to her semantic and academic knowledge as “black memory.” This separate system lacked emotional content and spatial organization, and it was acquired through deliberate effort rather than spontaneous recollection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond memory storage, TL described three additional rooms in her internal world, each associated with specific emotional functions. A cold “pack ice” room helped her cool down when angry. A “problems room” was empty but served as a space for pacing and thinking. A more uncomfortable “military room,” associated with her father’s absence due to military service, was linked to guilt. These features suggest a broader internal architecture shaped by emotional needs and reflective processes, not just memory content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To objectively assess TL’s autobiographical memory, the researchers administered two standardized tasks. The first, the TEMPau task, evaluates how people recall personal events from different life stages. TL was assessed only for childhood and adolescence, given her age. Her scores were well above the norm. She produced highly specific, richly detailed memories and consistently reported a sense of “remembering” rather than simply “knowing” facts. She also demonstrated an ability to shift between field and observer perspectives when describing events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second task, the TEAAM, measured her ability to recall or imagine brief, detailed episodes from both the past and the future. TL again performed at the top of the expected range. Her imagined future events were not only plausible and contextually rich, but also carried a strong feeling of “pre-experience”—a subjective sensation akin to remembering, but applied to anticipated personal events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that TL’s performance declined slightly when imagining more distant future events. This tendency aligns with what is typically seen in the general population: the further away an event is in time, the less vivid and detailed it tends to be. Still, TL’s ability to mentally travel through time—to revisit the past and pre-live the future—was striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although TL’s case provides compelling insights, it is important to acknowledge the limits of case studies in general. Single cases do not allow for broad generalizations. There are no control groups for comparison, and findings cannot speak to prevalence or typical development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In TL’s case, the researchers did not use some of the traditional diagnostic tools for hyperthymesia, such as verifying public event recall or testing calendar accuracy over many years. Her superior memory was based on self-report, corroborated by performance on specific tasks, but not benchmarked against the same criteria used in some earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also limits to verifying the accuracy of detailed childhood memories. Some events may be reconstructed, influenced by photos, family stories, or even dreams, which TL herself acknowledged as occasional sources of memory content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these constraints, case reports like this one remain an important tool in the scientific study of the mind. When researchers encounter rare or unusual cognitive profiles, documenting them in detail can generate new hypotheses, refine existing theories, and identify directions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In TL’s case, her vivid and structured autobiographical memory, along with her conscious and emotionally guided use of mental time travel, points to a potentially unique form of memory organization. Unlike previous cases where hyperthymesia seemed involuntary or overwhelming, TL appeared to have some degree of control over how she accessed and navigated her memories. Her experiences also invite questions about the role of emotion, spatial imagery, and subjective perspective in the construction of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, her use of imagined rooms tied to emotional regulation adds a novel dimension to how memory might interface with other cognitive processes. It hints at the possibility that some individuals may develop internal mechanisms to manage the emotional weight of their memories or structure them in ways that aid retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is difficult to generalize findings about hyperthymesia, since they rely on only a few cases. Does ageing affect the memories of these individuals? Do their mental time-travel abilities depend on age? Can they learn to control the accumulation of memories? We have many questions, and everything remains to be discovered. An exciting avenue of research lies ahead,” concludes La Corte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case report, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13554794.2025.2537950" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Autobiographical hypermnesia as a particular form of mental time travel&lt;/a&gt;,” was published August 1, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:19:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOTTdRb2s5RExvdVllUHg2UDhQT2tuMDZUbDRWZTZIZnRfUnV1dVBBRU9YQ1hySFVZcDZTQVpCZm9hTVdVV1BKZEZCYkhDV1JJR0ZHMW9zTXJvS2F6bDVNd0Zhd3lNcWhNSFFXVTlWS0MwcjdTcWF1U1dHYVJUTU05dWhlbFYzWnpGb3lSeEU4ekdmTGtxWnlXQVBGRGZPdGJwM0FoLVMwYw</guid></item><item><title>研究检测全球月经产品中的有毒PFAS化学物质- Earth.com</title><link>https://www.earth.com/news/study-detects-toxic-pfas-forever-chemicals-in-menstrual-products-available-worldwide/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusable menstrual products are meant to be the safer, greener option. A new, peer-reviewed study finds, however, that this is not always the case. Researchers found PFAS, also known as “&lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/pfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;forever chemicals&lt;/a&gt;” because of their persistence, in a range of period items and incontinence products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been used in various industrial and consumer products since the 1940s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are known endocrine disruptors, and the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt; links certain exposures to decreased fertility, some cancers, high cholesterol, and hormone effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pfas-in-menstrual-products"&gt;PFAS in menstrual products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work comes from Graham Peaslee at the &lt;a href="https://www.nd.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt;. His team and collaborators screened 59 reusable products across categories, then ran targeted tests on a subset to identify specific compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menstrual products, including underwear and reusable pads, showed the highest rates of intentional PFAS use, at 33 percent and 25 percent respectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS were detected in all extracted products, and the most abundant &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-plastic-food-packaging-contains-9936-harmful-chemicals/"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; were fluorotelomer alcohols 6:2 and 8:2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS come in ionic and neutral forms. Neutral PFAS lack an electrical charge, which can change how they move through materials and the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling work indicates several neutral PFAS may be absorbed through skin efficiently. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36917694/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; estimated dermal uptake for 11 neutral PFAS could exceed inhalation under certain indoor scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-found"&gt;What the study found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team first used a rapid screen for total fluorine to spot possible intentional use. They then measured the levels of 31 ionic and 11 neutral compounds in selected items to see what was actually present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern was consistent across markets sampled from North America, South America, and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one product in every category tested showed no signs of intentional fluorination, which suggests it is possible to manufacture these items without using PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pfas-free-menstrual-products"&gt;PFAS-free menstrual products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only a subset of the products had high levels of PFAS present, which means that PFAS must not be essential in the manufacture of reusable feminine hygiene products,” said Alyssa Wicks, the lead author and a postdoctoral assistant at &lt;a href="https://duke.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Duke University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding matters because it shows menstrual products can be manufactured successfully without these treatments. It also means product design choices, suppliers, and coatings make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin is not an absolute barrier. The outer layer is lipid rich, and neutral compounds can partition into it, which raises reasonable concerns for long wear items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neutral PFAS may also contact mucous membranes depending on the product. Data on long term uptake through vaginal tissue remain limited, so risk assessments are still evolving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-environmental-health-implications"&gt;Environmental health implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFAS in menstrual products do not stay confined to the user. When these items are washed, particles and residues can move into household wastewater, which eventually connects to larger water systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wastewater plants are not designed to filter PFAS, so the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forever-chemicals-threaten-arctic-wildlife-and-human-health/"&gt;chemicals&lt;/a&gt; can pass through treatment and return to rivers, lakes, and groundwater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once in the environment, PFAS can accumulate in fish and other wildlife. Studies have shown measurable levels in species that people eat, which means contamination cycles back into the food chain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection links individual product use to a wider public health issue that affects whole communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-lower-pfas-exposure-today"&gt;How to lower PFAS exposure today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking water is a major route for many communities. For households on contaminated systems or wells, certified home &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanups/reducing-pfas-your-drinking-water-home-filter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;filters&lt;/a&gt; can reduce several PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For textiles and period products, prefer options without stain or water repellence treatments. Choose brands that publish PFAS test reports for current lots, not just historical claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA set the first national drinking water &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/pfas-npdwr_fact-sheet_general_4.9.24v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; for several PFAS in April 2024. Utilities have a schedule to monitor and reduce levels, and states are aligning plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now filling key gaps on dermal absorption of neutral PFAS and on product to body transfer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standardized labeling and supplier auditing will help manufacturers avoid these chemicals while maintaining leak protection and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-still-do-not-know"&gt;What we still do not know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not yet know the real world dose that is obtained from wearing PFAS-treated textiles against skin. Laboratory models and screening data point to plausible exposure, but time on body, temperature, fabric structure, and wash history all matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also do not know how neutral PFAS absorbed via this route convert or persist once &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-dietary-fiber-supplement-could-remove-pfas-forever-chemicals-from-the-body/"&gt;inside the body&lt;/a&gt;. Targeted biomonitoring paired with product testing will be needed to answer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s snapshot is small but informative. It shows both the problem and the potential path forward. Reusable designs can work without PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyers can reward brands that disclose materials and publish independent testing, and makers can tighten supply chains to keep fluorinated treatments out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQbW96NmVSYzVrQ05yWmtwWjRVTDE2M0xWOUFzdkJPd3RoYTl0UnBlUm9Fdk5TZ0hyWVlJX1hJVnNkY3lfVlducFhYN1B3M2hjX0dYbjd3RVFzczlXX1FLSDdYRnFPSDd1VHNYWW1yNWlVRmFwdUJ2QjZ4VXhFRFVPTlVpN25hcEh6Y3p6S0d1VU0xNWZIWVhkanBkLUU2dkZuSDF4TW5RTi1jTHVUX2xYTnF3</guid></item><item><title>诊断软件使中风患者的完全康复率提高三倍-泰晤士报</title><link>https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/diagnostic-software-stroke-patients-ai-hghmzxs0s</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Half of stroke patients can now “fully recover” after the NHS introduced “revolutionary” software that allows patients to receive a diagnosis up to one hour faster compared with traditional methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Analysis from NHS England has found that the specialised AI-assisted tool has been used to interpret the brain scans of more than 60,000 patients since the roll-out last summer, as half of stroke patients now receive a diagnosis from the software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The service, available in 100 &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/topic/nhs" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; stroke clinics, allows for rapid processing and interpretation of brain scans, which helps doctors to make faster decisions about treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3"&gt;&lt;div id="6afd3834-a856-4c97-81b9-b9b611780b88"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;A stroke occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is cut off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The improved scans mean that patients can now get a diagnosis up to an hour faster than when they are diagnosed with traditional methods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;During a stroke, the&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; blood supply to parts of the brain is blocked or reduced, causing the brain cells to die.

This holds huge promise for enhancing brain health and memory in our aging population.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team believes the prebiotic harnessed the gut-brain axis and promoted the growth of good bacteria in the intestines that reduced inflammation in the brain and improved cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14607151/scientists-debunked-theory-cause-autism-study.html"&gt;'gut-brain axis',&lt;/a&gt; a network linking the digestive tract and the nervous system and brain, has been thought to be a key link between digestion and mental health for years, with some scientists claiming that the trillions of microbes in the intestines may influence mood, behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conducting the study in twins reduced the chances the changes observed were because of genetics, but the study was small, and scientists said it needs to be repeated in a larger group in order to support its findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study has found that two common supplements could help prevent dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic say the gut-brain axis explains everyday sensations such as 'gut feelings' or 'butterflies' in the stomach, and others suggest a balanced microbiome, or community of bacteria in the intestines, can boost brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are even suggestions an unbalanced microbiome in the gut could be linked to a higher risk of autism in children, and a higher risk of depression, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet many experts caution that much of the research up to this point remains preliminary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46116-y"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, scientists gave all participants the protein powder BCAA, sold for about 70 cents a capsule and a common supplement used to boost muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of the participants also received the prebiotic inulin, a type of fiber from roots, plus fructooligosaccharides, a type of carbohydrate found in plants and sometimes used as a low-calorie sweetener. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prebiotic supplements are readily available online and in retailers and cost about $3 a pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Twins who received both the powder and prebiotic scored better on Paired Associates Learning (PAL) tests, or tests that involve matching similar images used to help recognize early signs of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests on stool samples revealed twins who received the prebiotic had higher levels of Bifidobacterium in their gut compared to those not taking the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bifidobacterium are healthy bacteria shown to boost the body's immune system, improve digestion and even potentially help those struggling with depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote in their study: 'Our results demonstrate that cheap and readily available gut microbiome interventions may improve cognition in our ageing population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To confirm our findings, a larger study which includes a range of cognitive tests, alongside measures of effect and attention, and detailed microbiome measures is warranted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said their findings would only apply to healthy adults and not to those who had already developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at Johns Hopkins say that there is a 'second brain' in the gut, or the enteric nervous system, formed of two thin layers of more than 100million nerve cells that line the gastrointestinal tract from the throat to the rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cells do not 'think' like in the brain, primarily being involved in digestion and the release of enzymes to break down food, but there is evidence that they send signals back to the brain that can trigger shifts in mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies have already linked this to shifts in mood in those with irritable bowel disease, a chronic bowel pain disorder, and caused by constipation or diarrhea.&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating condition that gradually robs sufferers of their abilities to take care of themselves, speak and remember events and people in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of Americans suffering from the condition is expected to surge, according to some estimates, and jump to almost 13million by 2050, nearly double today's patient figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of the disease include forgetting names or familiar objects, becoming lost in familiar places or unexplained changes in emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for the condition, but scientists have developed medications that may be able to slow the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cause of Alzheimer's is not clear, but studies suggest it may be linked to a build-up of proteins in the brain, or to damage to blood vessels in the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As part of the study, researchers also investigated whether the supplements influenced muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists suggest that the regulation of muscle growth may be controlled by key signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were asked to also complete a weight-lifting session twice per week, and do exercises including squats, calf raises and bicep curls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed no difference in muscle mass or chair rise times, the time it takes someone to get up from a chair, at the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers suggested this may have been because the study was too short to show any shifts in muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"TB outbreaks are also uncommon in United States school settings. In any case, please note we are committed to both an individual’s right to privacy and protecting the health of all students and staff." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB is an airborne disease that typically affects the lungs but can also impact the brain, kidneys or the spine. Spending extended time in an enclosed space with someone infected is "required for TB to spread between people," according to BHSJCHA. While it is contagious, it's less so than the flu or a cold, and cannot be transferred through  shaking someone’s hand, sharing food or drink, sharing toothbrushes, sharing school supplies, kissing, touching bed linens or touching toilet seats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following safety recommendations were made to the CHS community: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you or your child are not identified as exposed to TB, no action is required on your part, and testing is not recommended. However, if you choose to seek testing for your peace of mind, you may contact your doctor or the BHSJCHA clinic at 517-279-9561 extension 123.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor for TB signs and symptoms in yourself or your child. Although it is cold and flu season, TB symptoms can be different. Active TB disease can cause a cough with or without blood, sweating at night, weight loss or inability to gain weight, low appetite, feeling tired, swollen glands, or chest pain, among others. These symptoms can start gradually and not go away for months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you or your child have these symptoms, contact your doctor and BHSJCHA team using the information below.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watch for further CHS and BHSJCHA communications. If you or your child is identified as being exposed to TB, be ready to complete a consent form for evaluation and testing, as well as receive notification for where and when evaluation and testing will occur.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until 2021, the United States experienced a nearly 30 year decline in TB cases, including a large decline in 2020, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Recovery from pandemic-related health care disruptions, increases in post-pandemic travel and outbreaks in several states have "likely contributed" to recent upward TB trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-data/2024-provisional/index.html" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Provisional CDC data from 2024&lt;/a&gt; shows an 8% increase in TB cases nationally from 2023 (9,622 cases in 2023 and 10,347 cases in 2024) as well as an 11% increase in Michigan (149 in 2023 and 165 in 2024). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about TB can be found &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/site.html#gen" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/site.html#gen" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WWMT</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:26:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxNRGpzQ1drTUc1d0E3WkxPaVhNSzc5SGlBcEZrNkp0Y0RPY1BqVnJTU25XUDVmaklDclV4M3ZDYlN3QkJtVU5LdF9PdE5iYXNfSVZ2YWJBN1VTOC05dEpPVUxpUDM2WGw2dkZVZkZuUTkweUYzazhqSGtIa1plSU5fYXJJbjcxRURtWHA5X0xEdWNfUl9ybGRwQ2t1R1M3ZVY5THFrWkFQbnozQlhtWk92UGxBV2N0bkdpeTlkSWttME1wZHB0X1VOUWFMdW5BWjJvSE9MZEt4UDlucWxaRWozNTVxX0lSN2k3cy1vWWpjMkxRMFFLb1p0cDZJUlEwRHJWM1A2QzkxVGpxNjlX</guid></item><item><title>抑郁症会破坏避免不愉快事件的学习-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/depression-learning-avoidance-29648/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Depression specifically impairs the ability to learn how to actively avoid unpleasant events, though it does not affect avoidance behavior once learned. Researchers tested 465 participants across a range of depressive symptoms in a task adapted from rodent research, involving sounds and visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with more severe symptoms had difficulty at the learning stage but eventually performed at the same level as others once they acquired the skill. The findings suggest depression may uniquely affect the acquisition of avoidance learning rather than avoidance itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Impairment:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression interferes with learning to actively avoid unpleasant events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Catches Up:&lt;/strong&gt; Once tasks are learned, depressed individuals perform as well as others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Questions:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers aim to test how depression affects avoidance in complex or long-term contexts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Depression alters how people pursue rewards, but, conversely, whether depressive symptoms influence how people learn to avoid nonrewarding, unpleasant events is less clear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Tomm and colleagues, from the University of British Colombia, addressed this question in their &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt; paper to shed more light on the relationship between depression and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work brought together researchers from preclinical, cognitive, and clinical backgrounds, building stronger connections across fields to better understand the mechanisms of depression.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a behavioral task for study volunteers based off rodent research that involves participants listening to sounds while looking at a screen with visual cues signaling sounds to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants learned to avoid unpleasant sounds either by actively responding or withholding responses to cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a sample of 465 participants with a wide range of depressive symptoms from low to severe, the researchers found that people with more severe symptoms struggled to learn to actively avoid aversive sounds compared to those with less severe symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, once they did learn the task, their ability to actively avoid unpleasant sounds matched those with less symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, according to the authors, depressive symptoms may interfere specifically with learning to actively avoid unpleasant events, rather than with avoidance more broadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we still don’t know,” says Tomm, “is how depressive symptoms affect avoidance when people continue to learn after being proficient at an avoidance task, or in more complex situations where the best way to avoid something is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we actively explore these questions, we hope our work will provide a deeper understanding of how depression shapes avoidance behavior across different contexts.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c0ada5a4a9a180b3a6aeeeafb2a7ada5a4a9a180b3a6aeeeafb2a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;eNeuro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;'Antibiotics are great, they are miracles in severe bacterial infections where they can be life-saving,' Dr. Van Groningen explained (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know that antibiotic use is the number one factor for developing C.diff, or C. difficile infections, which can be absolutely terrible if you have seen or heard or read about these,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;C. diff is a type of bacteria that infects your colon, per &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15548-c-diff-infection"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, and is extremely contagious. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr. Van Groningen said that even if you don't develop C.diff from antibiotic use, it can heavily interfere with your gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In fact, there are a couple of recent studies that have shown that antibiotic use has been associated with a modest &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7377039/Some-antibiotics-linked-higher-risk-colon-cancer.html"&gt;increased risk of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;,' Dr. Van Groningen said in the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is postulated that one of the possible causative explanations for this could be the alteration in gut microbiome that comes along with antibiotic use,' she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Again, great drug for the right purpose, but I wouldn't use it just because.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next thing that the internist tries to avoid is the frequent use of Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication that's used primarily to treat allergies and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Another great example of a fantastic medication used in the acute setting for an allergic reaction, a rash, can be fantastic, but it is not meant to be used in the long term,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The next thing that the internist tries to avoid is the frequent use of Benadryl, an over-the-counter medication that's used primarily to treat allergies and inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Finally, she revealed that she would 'never trade sleep for productivity' - meaning that sleep is absolutely essential for our health and well-being (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She cited that there have been a few studies that found a link between long-term &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14918501/benadryl-crippling-disease-warning.html"&gt;Benadryl use and dementia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Plus, the long list of side effects, especially in older adults, can be quite burdensome,' she warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the side effects that the doctor named were sedation, constipation, and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just not great as a long-term option,' she maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, she revealed that she would 'never trade sleep for productivity' - meaning that sleep is absolutely essential for our health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is not something that I think we should be doing when we have time, it is the cornerstone of our health,' she stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9491791/Lack-SLEEP-increase-risk-dementia-study-finds.html"&gt;so many different studies&lt;/a&gt; that link chronic sleep deprivation with an increased risk of a multitude of chronic diseases, everything from dementia to cardiovascular disease,' the doctor shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said that on a long-term basis, it's important to maintain a healthy sleep schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Sep 2025 17:05:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQNmdTdmp3VkhEX1hVQnZ6OVZ5NUFfQzY1YURrQnRLQlY2VndXdEZDOEZJSUhfek4tcE1rUkNHSFFLb1BkZ0ZUQkY2Y1VZX2ZXbUk4MGRpZ2dBaExQODd1MnBLNEZiRUdsb0FncTNuQjNiMk9Ha0I2RXF1Wk9lRDI1UGZqeWRlSTRqM0V2c0VxaUlEUDN3Wng1RtIBngFBVV95cUxOMUd0eldDeUtaZHoxMEEzZy1oZXc4TTc2THMzY2Z2QjRQQU56QkVkb2UwcFFSamZQTXBnUWlSeDlNeXkycFlOQ1p6cmxRWkRlN1hzci1fNlVOajctR3hzbXM5U3piZDJUbDNNYkZJTG1YVmFtM2VPZUdTNjNPQUJfYXdkMkhSNUU0czNDX0pfLUszMExveXdkN3k4dDcwQQ</guid></item><item><title>40岁以上的每个人都应该做的4项基本练习，以保持终身强壮-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/essential-exercises-stay-strong-after-40/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;Once you reach the 40 milestone, building and maintaining your strength becomes more important than ever. Staying strong as you age will help you remain independent, protect your joints, and keep your body fit and functional for decades to come. However, with all the information online, it can be overwhelming to know where to start. That’s why we chatted with &lt;b&gt;Amanda Dvorak, CPT&lt;/b&gt;, a certified personal trainer at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/amandadvorak" target="_blank"&gt;Garage Gym Reviews&lt;/a&gt;, who shares her four essential exercises that those over 40 should do to stay strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular strength training can help you maintain (and even build) muscle well into your later years. According to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" target="_blank"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;, resistance training in older adults can help slow natural muscle loss that occurs with aging while also improving mobility, reducing fall risk, and boosting quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;These four key exercises are ultra-effective as they’re easy to modify, require little or no equipment, and engage multiple muscle groups at once. This means you can get plenty of benefits in a short amount of time, whether you’re at home, traveling, or in the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s exactly how to perform each one, along with tips for proper form, reps, and sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For anyone looking to get stronger, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-many-squats-to-see-results-after-40/"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt; are an absolute must. They strengthen your &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7039033/" target="_blank"&gt;glutes&lt;/a&gt;, quads, hamstrings, and core, all of which are crucial for walking, climbing stairs, and standing up from a seated position. Plus, stronger legs mean more stability and less risk of falls as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Squats are one of the best ways to maintain lower body strength and mobility,” Dvorak says. “They keep your hips, knees, and ankles working together, which helps with balance and everyday movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and your toes slightly turned out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your chest tall and core tight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your knees and push your hips back as if sitting into a chair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower until your thighs are parallel to the floor (or as low as you can).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to return to the standing position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; As you get stronger, you can hold light dumbbells or a kettlebell for added resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This classic &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-exercises-build-strength-after-50/"&gt;bodyweight exercise&lt;/a&gt; has stood the test of time for a reason: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/push-ups-elite-upper-body-strength-trainers/"&gt;Pushups&lt;/a&gt; develop upper-body pushing strength and core stability. “Pushups build strength in your chest, shoulders, arms, and core. They’re also easy to modify by dropping to your knees if needed or elevating your hands,” Dvorak explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get in a high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor while keeping them at about a 45-degree angle from your torso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your palms to return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modification:&lt;/b&gt; If regular pushups are too difficult, perform them on your knees or with your hands on an elevated surface, such as a bench or countertop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rows are a pulling exercise that strengthens the muscles between your shoulder blades, lats, and biceps. They’re essential for balancing the front-to-back strength of your upper body, which &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/is-it-too-late-to-save-your-posture" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; says can help counteract the rounded posture many people develop from sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether with resistance bands or a suspension trainer, rows pull your shoulders back and strengthen your upper back and arms,” Dvorak says. “This helps fight poor posture and keeps your shoulder joints healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it (band version):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchor a resistance band to a secure object at chest height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the ends with your palms facing each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step back to create light tension in the band.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull the band toward your ribcage, squeezing your shoulder blades together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly return to the starting position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Reps:&lt;/b&gt; 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds between sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your shoulders down and away from your ears throughout the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.eatthis.com/plank-variations-for-six-pack/"&gt;Planks&lt;/a&gt; are a highly effective isometric exercise, meaning you hold the position instead of moving. They engage your deep core muscles, glutes, shoulders, and back, training them to work together to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12155697/" target="_blank"&gt;stabilize your spine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Planks challenge your core in a way that helps prevent back pain and improves posture,” Dvorak explains. “They also build full-body tension and stability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to do it:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie face down and place your forearms on the floor with your elbows under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your body off the floor so you’re supported on your forearms and toes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your body flexed to avoid sagging or piking at your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sets &amp;amp; Time:&lt;/b&gt; Start with 3 sets of 20 to 30-second planks, working up to 60 seconds per set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip:&lt;/b&gt; Keep your neck neutral by looking at the floor rather than forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These four exercises work all the major muscle groups and support the movement patterns you use every day. For a simple, effective full-body workout, perform them in a circuit like so:&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squats: 10 to 15 reps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushups: 8 to 12 reps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rows: 10 to 15 reps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plank: 20 to 60-second hold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest for 30 to 60 seconds between exercises and repeat the full circuit three or four times. If you stay consistent with this routine, you’ll significantly increase your chances of staying strong for life.&lt;/p&gt;
