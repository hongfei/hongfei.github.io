It makes the user feel disconnected and detached from their pain and environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WTMVWNH4A5DNFJWRVDEVXGZMGY"&gt;It can also induce auditory and visual hallucinations. These effects make ketamine a popular club drug, where it’s known as “Special K” or “Vitamin K.” But in those settings, ketamine is more likely to have been obtained illegally, diverted or stolen from legitimate sources, particularly veterinary clinics, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I7D44ECRF5AENAECRLNMS3UUM4"&gt;It’s classified by the federal agency as a schedule III controlled substance meaning it’s illegal to possess without a prescription because it can be abused or cause addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OP3GI47JGFDYNHCTJUR3ZGUDDI"&gt;But ketamine can still legally be prescribed by healthcare providers for unapproved uses if they determine it’s “medically appropriate” for their patient, according to the FDA. It’s similar to how the GLP-1 drug Ozempic is only FDA-approved to treat type two diabetes, but many people use it for weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MTO2R36U35GIBH2QWLPL2YJJMM"&gt;Providers may&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;suggest an off-label drug when there’s not an approved drug to treat the patient’s disease yet or when the patient has tried all approved treatments without seeing any benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JNR2K4CDGBGP5JSHSPNMLRR3SA"&gt;Mitchell was in the latter category — she tried it all. She had been on a gamut of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications since her early 20s. They all made her feel like a zombie. She bounced from therapist to therapist seeking treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3FFX3OHQCRGNVI46R7JNZDZONI"&gt;She tried alternatives to traditional therapies, too. But even three rounds of transcranial magnetic stimulation, a noninvasive procedure which uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells to improve symptoms of depression, failed to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DVEMFKFXSJDKHAGMZTKQWKWBTY"&gt;“I’ve tried pretty much everything to get some relief from my symptoms.

Although Mitchell had previously administered ketamine to patients in her job as a nurse practitioner, she was initially hesitant to seek the treatment for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2OYAKT6IGND47C4ZXHJV67UR4Q"&gt;“I was afraid that if anyone knew, it wouldn’t look good for me,” she said, referring ketamine’s reputation as a recreational party drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5L6R4QGWEFAVVE3GNQGLLR4LRM"&gt;After an initial consultation, Mitchell walked into Keta Medical Center for her first treatment.

You don’t need a referral from a mental health professional to do so.

His death put ketamine treatment under a microscope. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38" data-gaid="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YWBIBZ3UJ5B7PF2JMPOKJO5GIU"&gt;Like other drugs, ketamine is not without risk and can be addictive. Although still rare,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7344a4.htm" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; overdose deaths&lt;/a&gt; involving ketamine and&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02698811221140006" target="_blank" rel=""&gt; poisonings&lt;/a&gt; involving ketamine have increased in recent years.

But providers say that ketamine treatment is safe and effective when delivered under medical supervision by qualified healthcare professionals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40" data-gaid="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7C7L74YKV5E5XC6ATTLVMSVDYU"&gt;“We have strict guidelines in terms of regimens and protocols that we follow,” said T.J.

IV ketamine, on the other hand, is generally not covered. However, Shah and Bayoh said that some of their patients have reported partial reimbursement for IV ketamine infusions, which cost $425 per session at Vital IV Infusions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-45" data-gaid="inarticle-45"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BRWKJ2CHAVHJTMATBPIIIJH3SA"&gt;“Sometimes people don’t feel like themselves on oral medications, but on the IV ketamine they’ve done way better.

needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Currently diagnosis options in the UK are often slow, expensive and can be invasive, meaning thousands miss out on the benefits one can bring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s great to see blood tests like this approved for clinical use in the US. We hope to see the same in the NHS, which is why we’re part of the Blood Biomarker Challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Blood Biomarker Challenge is a multimillion-pound research programme supported by the Alzheimer’s Society, Alzheimer’s Research UK and the National Institute for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Care Research. Its goal is to bring blood tests for dementia diagnosis to the National Health Service by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Oakley said: “Blood tests will be critical to accelerate diagnosis and give more people access to the care, support and treatments they desperately need faster than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We must see long-term investment in the tools and workforce needed to ensure everyone living with dementia can get an early an accurate diagnosis, which is even more important with disease-modifying treatments on the horizon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “We urgently need to improve how we diagnose dementia and it’s great to see international research working towards this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Blood tests in this study look at p-tau217 and amyloid beta 42/40 and showed the tests offered high accuracy in confirming Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This study adds to the growing evidence that blood tests can detect the diseases that cause dementia in people with early memory and thinking problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“An important point to consider is that people taking part in research don’t always reflect the full diversity of those affected by dementia, who might have additional conditions or other characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That is why work is needed to understand whether these blood tests work in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the UK, studies like the Blood Biomarker Challenge are helping to build this evidence.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Food&lt;/em&gt; takes that next step.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It found that people who consumed a wider variety of flavonoid-rich foods had a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-may-reduce-premature-death-risk-by-23-percent-8656685" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of dying&lt;/a&gt; from any cause and were less likely to develop &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/happiness-may-help-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-stroke-8714853" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chronic diseases like heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, type 2 diabetes—and even cancer. The findings suggest that expanding the range of flavonoid-rich foods in your diet may offer more protection than sticking to just a few favorites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let’s take a closer look at what the study found—and what it means for your health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers analyzed data from more than 124,000 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank, a long-term health study. Participants were between 40 and 69 years old at the time of enrollment and were followed for up to 11.8 years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To assess diet, the researchers used 24-hour dietary recall surveys that captured participants’ intake of various foods and beverages. They specifically focused on flavonoids—a class of compounds found in colorful plant foods known for their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What made this study unique is how it measured not just the &lt;em&gt;amount&lt;/em&gt; of flavonoids people consumed, but also the &lt;em&gt;diversity&lt;/em&gt;—meaning how many different types of flavonoids they were getting from various foods. The researchers used mathematical tools to calculate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275617/why-you-should-eat-the-rainbow-when-it-comes-to-fruits-and-vegetables/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary diversity&lt;/a&gt; and then analyzed how this related to the risk of developing chronic illnesses over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants with the highest diversity of flavonoid intake had:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;14% lower risk of dying from any cause&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10% lower risk of cardiovascular disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20% lower risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8% lower risk of cancer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8% lower risk of respiratory disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In short, people who ate a greater variety of flavonoids—regardless of the amount—tended to live longer and had lower rates of chronic conditions like cancer. The protective effect was strongest in people who consumed both a high quantity and high diversity of flavonoids. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like all observational studies, this one can’t prove cause and effect. The data came from self-reported dietary questionnaires, which are prone to some reporting error. The study also didn’t include certain types of flavonoid-rich foods (like specific berries), which may underestimate true intake. And since the UK Biobank participants are not fully representative of the general population, more research is needed to confirm these findings across different groups.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating more plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; is good for your health—but this study adds a new layer: variety matters. Researchers found that people who ate a &lt;em&gt;greater diversity&lt;/em&gt; of flavonoid-rich foods had a lower risk of cancer and other chronic illnesses, even after accounting for other health behaviors. That means it’s not just about drinking green tea every day or always grabbing the same apple—it’s about mixing it up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what does a flavonoid-rich, diverse day actually look like? You might start with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-tea-to-drink-to-live-longer-8787658" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cup of black tea&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of berries at breakfast, enjoy an apple or some citrus at lunch, then add &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8032757/grape-smoothie/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;red grapes&lt;/a&gt; to your dinner salad. The more different sources you include, the more types of flavonoids you're getting—and the stronger the potential protective effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tea, berries, apples, oranges and grapes were among the top contributors to flavonoid intake in the study, but they’re just the beginning. Think about how you can rotate these in and out of your week. Swapping strawberries for blueberries, choosing an orange over apple slices, or enjoying a piece of dark chocolate after dinner are all small moves that can add up.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also worth considering the flip side: when your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dieting-trends-that-need-to-be-retired-11681807" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diets lack diversity&lt;/a&gt;—especially in fruits and vegetables—you may be missing out on protective compounds that could lower your risk of cancer and other chronic conditions. This study suggests that eating the same thing every day, even if it’s healthy, might not offer the full range of benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Building diversity into your diet doesn’t require a complete overhaul. Start by looking at your weekly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grocery list&lt;/a&gt; or what’s in your fruit bowl. Are there a few new things you can try? A wider range of colors usually means a wider range of nutrients—and this study suggests that could mean stronger disease protection, too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A large new study suggests that eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-anthocyanins-11727484" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;greater variety of flavonoid-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;—like tea, berries, apples, oranges and grapes—may lower your risk of cancer and other major chronic diseases. The greatest protection came from combining high quantity with high diversity. Small, simple shifts toward more colorful, plant-forward meals could support your long-term health in powerful ways.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Researchers say a new blood test for Alzheimer's disease has been shown to be highly accurate in detecting people with early symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists looked for two proteins - amyloid beta 42/40 and p-tau217 - and found the test was 95% accurate in identifying patients with existing cognitive impairment linked to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US study involved 509 patients in an outpatient memory clinic in Florida and was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316"&gt;published in the medical journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Alzheimer's and Dementia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test, which has already been approved by the US regulator, was also 82% accurate for specificity, which means it could rule out people without &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/topic/dementia-6062" target="_blank"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Gregg Day, who led the study, said the test was as good as existing, but more invasive, tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the next step was to extend the test to a wider range of patients, including those with early Alzheimer's who do not have any cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists say the two proteins, which they have identified in blood plasma, are associated with the buildup of amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Amyloid protein can be found in our brains, but in Alzheimer's disease, amyloid sticks together and forms abnormal deposits, which are thought to be toxic to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Richard Oakley, associate director for research and innovation at the Alzheimer's Society in the UK, said the results "suggest this test is very accurate".&lt;/p&gt;        
&lt;p&gt;"Blood tests will be critical to accelerate diagnosis and give more people access to the care, support and treatments they desperately need faster than ever before," he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may come as a surprise that heart-healthy wheat bran can have a negative effect on bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wheat bran has high levels of phytates, which can prevent calcium absorption,” Matzkin explained. Many people eat wheat bran because it’s high in dietary fiber, which is essential for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3507301/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;keeping you regular&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22872372/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;decreasing heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3213242/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;preventing colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, all important considerations for many Americans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, if you’re a consumer of oat bran (which is different from wheat bran), it doesn’t have the same deleterious effects on bones as wheat bran, according to Matzkin, as it doesn’t contain high levels of phytates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phytates are a type of &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/anti-nutrients/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;anti-nutrient&lt;/a&gt; naturally found in plants. Many of your favorite veggies and legumes (from kale and cabbage to beans and peanuts) contain compounds that reduce the absorption of other nutrients. Pseudoscience makes a big deal out of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7600777/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;avoiding these compounds&lt;/a&gt;, but for the most part, there’s no reason to avoid these otherwise-healthy foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans, spinach and beets also contain anti-nutrients that can decrease calcium absorption, but soaking (in the case of dried beans) or cooking (for raw spinach and beets) lessens their impact, according to Waller. “Beans and wheat bran contain phytates, and spinach and beets contain oxalates that decrease calcium absorption as they bind to the calcium,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to reduce the phytates in wheat bran, you can try &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/10/2929" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7887313" data-affiliate="true"&gt;soaking, sprouting or fermenting&lt;/a&gt; it. Since it has tons of other benefits, there’s no need to completely remove it from your diet, just moderate your intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As with almost all foods, moderation is key,” Matzkin said. “No need to completely eliminate wheat bran from the diet, but understanding that it can affect [calcium] absorption should prompt supplementation with other [calcium]-rich foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Added sugar pushes blood pressure higher, drives visceral fat, and nudges blood glucose past healthy limits. For most people, swapping table sugar for something less taxing could be a small shift with outsized benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that the switch might already be sitting on the breakfast table. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at what happens when adults trade two tablespoons of refined sugar for an equal amount of pure maple syrup, and the results point to improvements in several early warning signs of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/strawberries-promote-cardiometabolic-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiometabolic&lt;/a&gt; trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sugar-has-invaded-our-lives"&gt;Sugar has invaded our lives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans swallow about 17 teaspoons of added sugar each day, roughly two to three times the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;’s recommended cap for men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health guidelines urge keeping added sugars below ten percent of daily calories and, ideally, closer to six percent for better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back is easier when the replacement tastes familiar. Maple syrup fits the bill but offers more than sweetness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have cataloged more than 67 &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-polyphenols-promote-heart-health-youthful-skin-and-a-healthy-waistline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polyphenols&lt;/a&gt; in the amber liquid alongside minerals, vitamins, and amino acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-maple-syrup-vs-sugar-the-test"&gt;Maple syrup vs. sugar – the test&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest work, led by Dr. André Marette at Laval University’s &lt;a href="https://www.iucpq.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Quebec Heart and Lung Institute&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. Marie-Claude Vohl at the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods (&lt;a href="https://www.inaf.ulaval.ca/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;INAF&lt;/a&gt;), enrolled 42 volunteers aged 18 to 75 with body mass index values between 23 and 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person replaced five percent of daily calories – about two tablespoons – with either Canadian maple syrup or a flavored sucrose syrup for eight weeks. After a four-week washout, the groups switched syrups so every participant served as their own control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know from decades of research that maple syrup is more than just sugar. It contains over 100 natural compounds, including polyphenols, that are known to prevent disease in part through their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-with-milk-has-powerful-anti-inflammatory-properties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-inflammatory effects&lt;/a&gt;,” remarked Dr. Marette. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the fundamental chemistry of maple syrup is unique, they wondered if ingesting maple syrup instead of an equivalent amount of refined sugar would differently impact cardiometabolic health and the intestinal microbiota in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Marette, “The results were extremely encouraging. I did not expect to see so many improvements of risk factors within a relatively short treatment period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-shifts-in-key-markers"&gt;Surprising shifts in key markers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks on maple syrup, participants handled an &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meal-time-has-a-major-influence-on-our-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oral glucose&lt;/a&gt; tolerance test far better than when they consumed the sucrose syrup, showing a change of -50.59 versus +29.93. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systolic blood pressure edged down by -2.72 millimeters of mercury, while it crept up +0.87 millimeters on the sucrose phase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Android fat mass – deep abdominal fat linked to heart disease – dropped -7.83 grams on maple syrup but rose +67.61 grams with refined sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both individually and collectively, the study findings are quite significant. The combined decrease of such key risk factors may help to reduce the risk of diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/a-century-of-progress-in-the-fight-against-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Marette enthused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making a commitment to lifestyle changes and small adjustments to our everyday diets is important and can be a powerful tool in preventing future diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-maple-syrup-is-different"&gt;Why maple syrup is different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests were only half the story. Stool samples showed fewer Klebsiella species and &lt;em&gt;Bacteroides pectinophilus&lt;/em&gt; – microbes tied to inflammation – after maple syrup consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;em&gt;Lactocaseibacillus casei&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clostridium beijerinckii&lt;/em&gt; flourished. These shifts hint that maple’s natural compounds may influence metabolism partly through the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pure maple syrup brings trace nutrients along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two tablespoons supply about 35 percent of a day’s manganese, 15 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/low-carb-diets-have-more-nutritional-value-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;riboflavin&lt;/a&gt;, eight percent of copper, and small but measurable amounts of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/amaranth-seeds-rich-in-calcium-and-iron-prevents-tumors-and-keeps-bones-strong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt;, thiamin, and potassium, all while carrying roughly twelve percent fewer calories than light corn syrup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined sugar, in contrast, arrives stripped of such extras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With each new study, we learn more about the benefits that natural products from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-plant-species-show-great-promise-in-fight-against-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;medicinal plants&lt;/a&gt; and functional foods, like maple syrup, provide,” noted Dr. Navindra Seeram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The promising results of this first human trial provide more reasons to educate consumers about maple syrup’s many health benefits. It is truly a ‘smarter sweetener’ and a healthier alternative to refined sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-maple-syrup-data-is-needed"&gt;More maple syrup data is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size was modest, and the trial lasted just eight weeks. Even so, the consistency across multiple risk factors stands out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study was limited to a relatively small sample size (42 men and women) and took place during a relatively short period, the results are still significant,” Dr. Marette remarked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have human evidence to support replacing refined sugars with maple syrup, a natural sweetener, for preventing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/christensenella-minuta-gut-bacteria-linked-obesity-different-men-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolic diseases&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists’ next goal is to conduct larger studies with other populations to explore how replacing refined sugars with maple syrup might impact their unique health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-make-the-swap"&gt;How to make the swap&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping maple syrup for sugar in your diet is as simple as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the study, I would consume pure maple products regularly but not consistently,” one study participant shared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have always enjoyed it. Today my routine is to replace refined sugars with two tablespoons of pure Canadian maple syrup daily.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small swaps add up. Cutting just two tablespoons of refined sugar trims roughly 96 calories and more than 24 grams of straight sucrose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing pure maple syrup in place of refined sugar, you enact a modest dietary change backed by evidence of healthier glucose responses, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-foods-might-work-like-medicines-to-lower-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, diminished visceral fat, and a more favorable gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies will refine these insights, the present trial already encourages individuals, clinicians, and food producers to rethink sweetening habits and embrace this nutrient-rich natural syrup as a wiser everyday indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone edging toward metabolic trouble, that simple switch may be one easy step toward better numbers at the next check-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(24)00465-6/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:19:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPX2VZRVZDbzZqb1dzSFhIR0lVY0lCUWYzWEpXa2FWRW03X2pkX1kwVWxGVW5JZU5OSU1XNExjQmkzWmFZSWRjVjNENFRoZWRCcnE0VGRlZk1xa19qbzRROW1rMlFuMGRxTmRqV0FRcmlINU1UbktsSm5OUU0wQnpfNHRqVzZCVGM3QktkaHVYVjZuY2JqSnlObV9mNUhFUTIzQUJFYXY1VjlWV0xucXlabm9hNmNpS1NDNDdj</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员警告罗切斯特山诊所可能有麻疹暴露- ClickOnDetroit | WDIV Local 4 | Health officials warn of possible measles exposure in Rochester Hills clinic - ClickOnDetroit | WDIV Local 4</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxNX3JuTl9fakZENjF0dmp2ODgwblFyMjVCWlRwcTQ1ZGZsSWNmaFFIeXU3amRhaHpzTlhwRUVaV0xvRXpuX1R2Z0JPRmdzQjlGSVhFZXhjcWdrWU54djlEeFhpczU0T0tfSG5GTkNQMnk1WWg5SmV2YVdFaXFXWXN2N21FZ3paTzRoYlhFbTZZNmhqQnRTZ2prWG8zcXBodXdjLVRacXVPXzNXQ3EyQ0FSdmZubWNnRkRTazQzT0JOZlNRbnIyRjZydkJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROCHESTER HILLS, Mich.&lt;/strong&gt; – The Oakland County Health Division is notifying the public about a measles exposure site involving a person from another county. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;Individuals who visited the medical office building at 3950 S.

            As measles cases in the United States continue to mount, neighboring countries Canada and Mexico are also experiencing significant outbreaks – all of which have been linked to at least one death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100043b6mb9pf6us4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Thursday, the chief medical officer of health of the Canadian province Ontario announced that an infant who was born prematurely with a measles infection had died.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100053b6m5hkds6gw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The infant contracted the virus before birth from their mother, who had not received the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine,” Dr. Kieran Moore said in a &lt;a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1006004/statement-from-the-chief-medical-officer-of-health" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “While measles may have been a contributing factor in both the premature birth and death, the infant also faced other serious medical complications unrelated to the virus.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100063b6mg87spso6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least four people have died from measles in Mexico in 2025, and three people have died in the US: two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico, all of whom were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            This years’ measles outbreaks are the biggest that Canada and Mexico have seen in decades, and the World Health Organization has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON565" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that the “overall risk of measles in the Americas Region is considered high.” Low vaccination rates are a key driver of this elevated risk assessment, the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100083b6m3ec1ydi9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mexico has reported at least 1,520 measles cases as of late May, according to &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/documents/measles-rubella-bi-weekly-bulletin-19-20-17-may-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the Pan American Health Organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu100093b6m5v0pcgpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Canada reached measles elimination status in 1998, meaning that there has not been continuous spread of the virus for more than a year. But there have already been more cases reported so far this year than there were in the previous 27 years combined. At least 2,755 measles cases have been reported in Canada so far this year, according to federal &lt;a href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; that was last updated on Monday, the vast majority of those which have been in Ontario residents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000a3b6mx5wzf84c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And the US has reported at least 1,168 measles cases so far this year, according to federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; published Friday – nearly 80% of which are associated with an outbreak centered in West Texas that has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Canada. It’s the second highest number of cases that the US has reported since achieving measles elimination status in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000b3b6m3627dng5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Significant shares of the measles outbreaks in the US, Canada and Mexico have been concentrated in Mennonite communities that are closely connected to each other – and that have historically had low vaccination rates due largely to minimal interactions with formal health care systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000c3b6mcqzuxgwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, in a recent webinar, experts from the Pan American Health Organization did not formally link outbreaks in the three countries to each other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000d3b6macxlntjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The outbreak [in Mexico] started in Chihuahua, at the heart of Mennonite communities, who were very close to Texas through the border, but they’re also close to other Mennonite communities in Canada,” Dr. Alvaro Whittembury, regional adviser for the Comprehensive Immunization Special Program, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/events/webinar-between-urgency-and-resilience-culturally-aware-strategies-address-measles-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday. “It’s important to show that although at first the outbreak starts in Mennonite communities … the vast majority of cases are outside of these communities, and they are sustained in the general population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000e3b6mxhyd4lgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Only a small share of confirmed cases in the Americas have identified genetic sequences, experts from the Pan American Health Organization said, and there haven’t been enough identical sequences to explicitly link cases across countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000f3b6m6mn6qfp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Mexico issued a &lt;a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/992760/APV-EEUU-EEUU-CANADA-Sarampion_20250425_english.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; for people traveling to the US and Canada due to high measles case rates. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also stepped up its guidance for travelers, advising that anyone traveling internationally should be vaccinated with two doses of the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbldsgu1000g3b6m7h3t18vo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Anyone who is unvaccinated is at risk and I urge everyone, but especially those who may become pregnant, to ensure they have received two doses of the MMR vaccine, which will protect both a parent and baby,” Moore said in his statement Thursday. “This vaccine has been safely used for over 50 years and is highly effective. Two doses provide nearly 100 per cent protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The folds and ridges of the human brain are more complex than any other in the animal kingdom, and a new study shows that this complexity may be linked to the brain's level of connectivity and our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/it-really-is-in-your-head-thinking-hard-and-long-can-cause-brain-drain"&gt;reasoning abilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research led by a team from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) looked at the brain shapes and neural activity of 43 young people, and in particular the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_prefrontal_cortex"&gt;lateral prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; (LPFC) and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) – parts of the brain that handle reasoning and high-level cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grooves and folds on the brain are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulcus_(neuroanatomy)"&gt;sulci&lt;/a&gt;, with the smallest grooves known as tertiary sulci. These are the last to form as the brain grows, and the research team wanted to see how these grooves related to cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162712" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162712" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SulcalDepth.jpg" alt="Sulcal depth diagram" class="wp-image-162712 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SulcalDepth.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SulcalDepth-413x415.jpg 413w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SulcalDepth-600x603.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162712" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at sulcal length and sulcal depth. (Jannsen et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0606-21.2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;J. Neurosci&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2022)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hypothesis is that the formation of sulci leads to shortened distances between connected brain regions, which could lead to increased neural efficiency, and then, in turn, individual differences in improved cognition with translational applications," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/05/21/are-groovy-brains-more-efficient/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Kevin Weiner, from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed each sulci had its own distinct connectivity pattern, and that the physical structure of some of these grooves was linked to the level of communication &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-may-have-misunderstood-precisely-what-makes-our-brains-tick"&gt;between brain areas&lt;/a&gt; – and not just areas that were close to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It adds to the findings &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25162-w"&gt;of a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; carried out by some of the same researchers, which found the depth of certain sulci are associated with cognitive reasoning. Now we have more data to help scientists understand why that might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 60 and 70 percent of the brain's cortex (or outer layer) is hidden away inside folds, and these patterns change with age too. Tertiary sulci can vary significantly between individuals as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162714" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BrainScans-3.jpg" alt="Sulcal brain maps" class="wp-image-162714 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BrainScans-3.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BrainScans-3-509x415.jpg 509w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BrainScans-3-600x489.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162714" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers developed models that could identify sulci with high levels of accuracy. &lt;span&gt;(Häkkinen et al., &lt;em&gt;J. Neurosci&lt;/em&gt;., 2025)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While sulci can change over development, getting deeper or shallower and developing thinner or thicker gray matter – probably in ways that depend on experience – our particular configuration of sulci is a stable individual difference: their size, shape, location and even, for a few sulci, whether they're present or absent," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/05/21/are-groovy-brains-more-efficient/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Silvia Bunge, from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's clear from this research that the peaks and valleys of these brain structures are much more important than previously realized. They're not just random folds used to pack brains inside skulls – and may have evolved in certain directions over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the researchers have big plans when it comes to studying brain grooves. Eventually, it's possible that a map of these sulci could help in assessing brain development in children and spotting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-severe-brain-disorder-is-common-but-often-goes-undiagnosed"&gt;neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot more work to do before that can happen though, and the researchers are emphasizing that brain fold length and depth are just two of many factors involved when it comes to our cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cognitive function depends on variability in a variety of anatomical and functional features," &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2025/05/21/are-groovy-brains-more-efficient/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, we know that experience, like quality of schooling, plays a powerful role in shaping an individual's cognitive trajectory, and that it is malleable, even in adulthood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0726-24.2025"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent research reveals exciting connections between caffeine consumption and women’s health as they age. A groundbreaking study from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health offers promising evidence that women who regularly enjoy caffeinated coffee during midlife may experience better health outcomes later in life. The research specifically examined how different caffeinated beverages affect aging across multiple health domains, with coffee emerging as a potential ally in the quest for &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/21/93-year-old-man-body-40-year-old-scientists-amazed-his-fountain-youth-secret/"&gt;healthy aging strategies that can maintain vitality&lt;/a&gt; well into our senior years.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;Coffee consumption patterns and their impact on women’s health&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The comprehensive Harvard study tracked 47,513 women from the Nurses’ Health Study over an impressive 30-year period beginning in 1984. Researchers collected detailed dietary and health information every four years, paying special attention to caffeine intake from various sources including coffee, tea, cola, and decaffeinated coffee. This methodical approach allowed scientists to establish meaningful connections between consumption patterns and health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1384396993"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sara Mahdavi, lead researcher from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the University of Toronto, emphasized the uniqueness of this study: “While past studies have linked coffee to individual health outcomes, our study is the first to assess coffee’s impact across multiple domains of aging over three decades.” This holistic view of aging represents a significant advancement in our understanding of caffeine’s long-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/26/neither-banana-nor-apple-scientists-reveal-the-healthiest-fruit-of-all-and-why-you-should-eat-it-every-day/"&gt;

                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By 2016, researchers identified 3,706 women who met all criteria for “healthy aging” – defined as reaching at least 70 years while remaining free from 11 major chronic diseases, maintaining physical function, good mental health, and cognitive sharpness. These women typically consumed about 315 mg of caffeine daily during their midlife years (ages 45-60), equivalent to three small cups of coffee or one and a half large cups by today’s standards. Coffee contributed to more than 80% of their caffeine intake, suggesting this beverage may offer unique benefits that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/03/a-youtuber-walks-250000-steps-in-a-week-and-reveals-the-surprising-effects-on-his-body/"&gt;positively affect physical wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-3402857608"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Not all caffeine sources are created equal&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s most compelling findings is that the source of caffeine matters significantly. While regular coffee consumption showed positive associations with healthy aging, researchers found no significant benefits from decaffeinated coffee or tea consumption. This suggests that the unique combination of caffeine and other compounds specifically found in regular coffee may be responsible for the observed health benefits.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more striking was the discovery that cola consumption showed opposite effects. Each additional small glass of cola was associated with a 20% to 26% lower likelihood of healthy aging. This stark contrast highlights that simply consuming caffeine isn’t enough – the delivery method and accompanying ingredients play crucial roles in determining health outcomes. For women seeking to enhance their long-term health, this research suggests that mindful beverage choices matter.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study controlled for numerous factors that might influence aging outcomes, including body weight, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity levels, educational background, and dietary protein intake. This careful methodology strengthens the connection between coffee consumption and healthy aging, though researchers caution that the benefits remain modest compared to &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/26/10-strategies-used-high-achievers-stay-productive-motivated/"&gt;overall lifestyle habits that support longevity&lt;/a&gt; and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/18/better-than-nordic-walking-this-old-peoples-sport-melts-fat-with-minimal-effort-even-after-60/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Better than Nordic walking: this “old people’s sport” melts fat with minimal effort (even after 60).&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Quantifying the coffee-aging connection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For women in the healthy aging group, each additional daily cup of coffee corresponded to a 2% to 5% higher chance of maintaining good health in later years, &lt;a href="https://cdn.nutrition.org/article/S2475-2991(25)01522-7/fulltext"&gt;according to this study&lt;/a&gt;. This positive association held true for consumption up to five small cups daily (approximately 2.5 cups by current standards). The researchers presented these findings at NUTRITION 2025, the American Society for Nutrition’s annual meeting, on June 2.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mahdavi noted, “These results, while preliminary, suggest that small, consistent habits can shape long-term health. Moderate coffee intake may offer some protective benefits when combined with other healthy behaviors such as regular exercise, a healthy diet and avoiding smoking.” This perspective aligns with growing evidence that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/07/if-you-want-more-fulfilling-relationships-say-goodbye-these-10-habits/"&gt;daily habits significantly impact our wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; across physical, emotional, and social dimensions.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s extensive follow-up period of 30 years provides valuable insights into how midlife dietary choices can influence aging trajectories decades later. While the exact mechanisms behind coffee’s apparent benefits remain under investigation, this research suggests that women who include moderate amounts of caffeinated coffee in their daily routines may be supporting their long-term health in multiple ways.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;The broader implications for healthy aging research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This Harvard study contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that specific dietary choices can influence how we age. By examining multiple domains of aging simultaneously – physical function, mental health, absence of chronic disease, and cognitive preservation – researchers have created a more complete picture of what constitutes truly healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/05/02/nearly-60-years-ago-this-psychologist-discovered-the-7-38-55-rule-to-improve-emotional-intelligence/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Nearly 60 years ago, this psychologist discovered the 7-38-55 rule to improve emotional intelligence.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For women navigating midlife choices, this research offers practical guidance amidst sometimes conflicting nutritional advice. Unlike many health interventions that require significant lifestyle overhauls, incorporating moderate coffee consumption represents an accessible option that may complement other &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/15/this-simple-hack-can-help-calm-a-panic-attack-with-just-a-pen/"&gt;wellness strategies that support mental health&lt;/a&gt; and physical resilience.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s focus on women’s health specifically addresses an important gap in aging research. Women typically live longer than men but often experience more health challenges in later years. Understanding gender-specific factors that contribute to healthy aging can help &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/10/14/how-forget-someone-according-psychology/"&gt;develop tailored approaches to wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; that acknowledge physiological differences.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While coffee consumption shows promise as one component of a healthy aging strategy, researchers emphasize that no single habit exists in isolation. The most successful aging outcomes likely result from a combination of factors including regular physical activity, &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/28/it-grows-with-almost-no-light-needs-no-watering-and-filters-pollutants-perfect-for-dark-rooms-or-office-spaces/"&gt;environmental wellness factors&lt;/a&gt;, nutritious eating patterns, social connection, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco. Nevertheless, this research suggests that for many women, that morning cup of coffee might be doing more good than previously recognized.

Some of these cases have been linked to international travel while others remain under investigation due to unclear origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The majority of cases have been reported in Gaines county, home to a Mennonite community with historically low childhood immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Two children from the affected region, both unvaccinated and with no known pre-existing conditions, have died due to the disease. The earlier of those deaths was the first in the US from measles since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Texas state health services department figures&lt;/a&gt;, fewer than 10 of the confirmed cases are currently considered infectious – which is defined as individuals within four days before or after the appearance of the measles rash. Since January, 94 people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The state health agency has identified seven counties with ongoing measles transmission: Cochran, Dawson, Gaines, Lamar, Lubbock, Terry and Yoakum. The agency says it continues to work closely with local health officials to monitor and contain the spread.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Shuford says that the department has struggled to adequately encourage community members to get vaccinated, explaining that the state health service department is “really trying to strengthen our messaging at all times and so that we already have a relationship with different communities”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added that “vaccines are just such an instrumental way for us to maintain a healthy society that can be productive”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 20:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5OWUUxWHowc1d6dWc5SGNXNzBaUUxONWNDekNNYkQ3Zk1JRk5lNXJUOTFjRUp5a2p4RHFScWhkdFRtbi1DMzRVYVRkS1pFYjNWMVJCbEdUbElFeXU0Zk9tRmd0SWdLT0JBa2dmbGo1dWZ2U21KNVVGUnp3</guid></item><item><title>他领导了乔治· W ·布什的PEPFAR计划来阻止艾滋病。现在他担心它的未来- NPR | He led George W.

   &lt;p&gt;About two decades ago, Namibia was one of the hardest-hit countries in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. More than one in three adults tested positive for HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark Dybul remembers visiting a clinic in rural Namibia and meeting a woman and her baby. She was HIV-positive and was terrified of passing the virus on to the child. She named her baby No Hope in the local language.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's one of the most devastating things you could ever hear," Dybul says. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A game changer&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, soon changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;President George W. Bush created PEPFAR in 2003 and reauthorized it in 2008. Dybul was the principal architect of PEPFAR while he was at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and he was later appointed U.S. global AIDS coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PEPFAR has since given out billions every year to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with programs like free drugs to prevent mother-to-child transmission and widespread treatment of HIV-positive people to keep the virus from progressing to AIDS and to keep it from being spread to others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The State Department has credited it with saving 26 million lives so far.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/04/nx-s1-5423372/trump-wants-to-cut-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-for-controlling-hiv-aids" target="_blank"&gt;In an interview with NPR this week&lt;/a&gt;, Dybul tells a story about how he went back to Namibia and "here she was — and here that child was, four years later, because of the support from the American people that provided the antiretroviral therapy to her, which prevented her child from actually getting the virus" — which can be passed from mother-to-child not only during delivery but with breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71057" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Dr. Mark Dybul addresses a Senate hearing on global health issues in 2015. He was an architect of PEPFAR, the program created by President George W. Bush to stop the spread of AIDS. Programs like PEPFAR have saved lives, built health systems and brought more stability to countries hard hit by the virus, he says.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What will happen to PEPFAR?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now the future of PEPFAR is hazy. On Tuesday, President Trump asked Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid that lawmakers had already approved in 2024 and 2025 budgets — including $400 million allocated to PEPFAR.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The cuts would drastically reduce work on HIV and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's part of an ask, known as a rescission request, that would eliminate a total of $9.4 billion in funding for foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move would codify cuts already made by the U.S Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which dismantled USAID and absorbed it into the U.S. State Department in the first months of Trump's term and dramatically reduced PEPFAR's reach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR asked the State Department to comment on the impact of aid cuts on PEPFAR. The State Department did not respond in time for our deadline for publication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Congressional decision awaited&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Congress now has 45 days to respond to Trump's memo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move comes after a March &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277333/gov.uscourts.dcd.277333.60.0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;ruling&lt;/a&gt; by U.S. District Judge Amir Ali that the Trump administration acted "unlawfully" by halting foreign aid without Congress's approval.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The rescission request "put the ball squarely in Congress's court," says Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, an HIV prevention organization receiving PEPFAR funds that led the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Congress, at least to date, has moved not at all. The question really is, will they act?" Warren asks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some members of Congress have signaled they want to keep PEPFAR from being slashed — so PEPFAR's future is still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it has been an up-and-down year for PEPFAR. The program's work was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/25/g-s1-44762/pepfar-trump-hiv-foreign-aid" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;initially halted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the days following Trump's inauguration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed PEPFAR to resume operations again — but only or treatment of existing HIV-positive patients and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5295011/what-is-happening-with-pepfar-it-depends-whom-you-ask" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HIV prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; measures for pregnant and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That doesn't represent everyone at risk for HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are still 1.3 million new HIV infections every year, which means the pool of people who need treatment will grow rapidly without more prevention, Warren says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;These cuts do "exactly the opposite of what this administration says they want to do, which is to get countries to own their AIDS response and own their budget," Warren says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We all want to see that transition, but we're making it harder for countries by not helping them reduce the burden of treatment programs. And in fact, we're going to add to it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dybul agrees.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's important to note that this was never intended to be a forever program," he says in his NPR interview. "But if we don't stay in the game, all of those gains will be lost."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Eventually we should be in a position where there is no PEPFAR. But it can't be done overnight," Dybul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He still remembers how "absolutely catastrophic" HIV was only a few decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The epidemic was particularly brutal because HIV often kills young people in the prime of their lives, Dybul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You would have entire villages run by orphans because all the adults were gone. Countries could have ceased to exist. That's how devastating it was."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Programs like PEPFAR have saved lives, built health systems and made hard-hit countries like Namibia more stable, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And U.S. assistance also offered hope, Dybul says.

						&lt;p&gt;A tool that grew in popularity during the
COVID-19 pandemic might help communities track the flow of measles nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wastewater monitoring can serve as an “early warning
system,” according to North Carolina environmental engineer Angela Harris. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people are spreading these pathogens in their
urine or their stool, prior to exhibiting symptoms,” Harris explained. “If you’re
only doing clinical testing of people who are symptomatic, it’s going to be a
bit delayed.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris, an associate professor at NC State, worked closely
with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services amid early research
efforts during the SARS Co-V-2 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“When we were thinking about, ‘How can we help with this
response, and how can we address transmission?’ – wastewater is a really nice
sample type that allows us to look at community level exposures,” Harris explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris said every pathogen is different. The researcher
noted measles, for example, is shed through urine and not stool.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/how-wws-works.html"&gt;Wastewater
has been used as a helpful tool to look for other viruses&lt;/a&gt; including polio
and influenza, and for looking at widespread drug use. &lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The researcher noted data from water treatment facilities has
proven to be particularly helpful for hospital systems – as exhibited during the
pandemic – when making  “decisions about
elective procedures so they would have space for a rising outbreak, or surge in
cases.”&lt;/p&gt;

measles across the Untied States.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The online tool offers another way to track the flow of
measles as confirmed cases hit 1,168 across 34 jurisdictions, as of June 5,
2025. At least 89% of cases have been linked to 17 different outbreaks this
year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;All states bordering North Carolina, except for South
Carolina, have now reported at least one case of measles in the last few
months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris cautioned the system isn’t without its flaws, as she
noted it is more reliable when several people within a community are sick with
the same infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Say there are
100,000 people contributing to a wastewater treatment plant,” Harris explained.
“If just one of those people is infected, we’d have a very low probability of
detecting it in wastewater. But, if you had more people infected, say 100
people, you’d be maybe 50% likely to detect it in wastewater.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The researcher also said monitoring specific facilities,
such as individual schools, hospitals, or nursing homes, could also help
provide more detailed information about a particular viral spread. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Certain buildings will have one pipe of sewage that goes to
the main line, so you can install sampling devices within a network,” Harris said. “One neighborhood – all of their waste may be funneled to a single
point in the sewer network – so you could install a sampling device pretty
easily at a pump station.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris noted data from specific facilities would also help
health departments in planning strategic and targeted community outreach
efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If you are doing wastewater surveillance and you see certain
disease trends, vaccination campaigns can be quite effective in expanding
vaccination coverage to reduce transmission likelihood,” Harris said. “Schools
are another way to reach populations. If we see certain things in wastewater,
then health departments can work with schools to deliver information and to
offer vaccination campaigns.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Reducing spread among school populations is of particular
concern among health officials when it comes to measles. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The virus is highly contagious and can be particularly
dangerous for children. The CDC warns two out of the three confirmed deaths from
measles so far in 2025 were children. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;67% of the total cases reported across 33 states as of June
5 were in children under 19, with 95% of total cases occurring in patients who
were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/nc-hospitals-standby-measles-threat-may-2025/"&gt;North
Carolina hospitals are on high alert amid growing concerns of a potential
measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective when
protecting against measles, mumps, and rubella, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/toilets-early-warning-measles-outbreak-nc-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, runny nose, and
red, watery eyes. A red, blotchy rash may also appear throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Harris notes wastewater surveillance will likely be a useful
tool for health departments statewide moving forward who need to track community
spread of measles. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It can also be helpful if we have limited case data,” Harris added. “If there is some sort of stigma around going and reporting that you
are sick, or if there is not great access to healthcare services in some areas,
this wastewater surveillance allows us to collect data that may not have the
same access to health care or to testing as other populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;North Carolina is one of only six states involved in the
National Wastewater Surveillance System through the CDC. Data collected is used
to help drive innovation and help researchers detect infectious diseases across
the country.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liam's mother Ashlee (pictured together) said the pain was 'indescribable' as she lay with him after the medical team turned off life support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talking about the subsequent events, Ashlee told this website: 'We were hoping for a miracle and kept him on life support so that family and friends could visit for the next two days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With no improvements, we took him off of life support on Monday, April 28, and he passed peacefully at 3.35pm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14673485/child-flu-deaths-highest-swine-flu-outbreak-cdc.html"&gt;its similar-sounding name,&lt;/a&gt; haemophilus influenzae is not a flu virus but a bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many healthy people carry it in their nose or throat without symptoms, H. flu can turn lethal if it enters the bloodstream, causing the body to attack organs. It is particularly dangerous for young children, whose immune systems are still developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;H. flu is now rare due to widespread Hib vaccination, which has brought yearly cases in the US down from 20,000 in the 1980s to just 50 today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, vaccine uptake has been dropping since the Covid pandemic and doctors warn that it could make a deadly resurgence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liam was one of those rare cases. The vaccine — given over three doses to babies — is about 95 per cent effective at preventing infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although he was fully vaccinated as part of routine childhood immunizations, Liam fell into that small group for whom the vaccine isn't fully protective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Little Liam Dahlberg, eight, from Indiana , complained of a headache after coming home from school last month — the next day he was dead &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infectious disease doctors told Ashlee they believed that her son caught Hib from the cough or sneeze of an unvaccinated child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Being vaccinated limits your chances of contracting the disease and at the same time limits the carriage of the disease,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, basically in order to not see this disease to this extent, everyone should be vaccinated for it because then it would be eradicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not impossible for a vaccinated child to be carrying the bacteria but a vaccinated child would not spread the disease to this extent of being fatal unless an unvaccinated child contracted the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is why you don't see it very often because there are more vaccinated children than unvaccinated - but it's the unvaccinated that essentially destroying herd immunity.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact source of Liam's infection will never be known for certain but doctors said the timeline suggested exposure happened between April 22 and April 24.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now the family is sharing his devastating case in the hope of raising awareness about Hib - and the importance of maintaining high levels of childhood vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They don't just protect you they protect others who may not be able to be vaccinated and who may have weakened immune systems,' Ashlee said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He was diagnosed with haemophilus influenzae, also known as H. flu , which had spread to his brain and spinal cord &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The family is still unsure how Liam caught the infection — he had been fully vaccinated against H.flu as part of his routine childhood schedule&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pediatricians have warned of declining vaccine uptake overall in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, though there is no detailed data as to the fall in rates for children when it comes to H. flu. Misinformation and political polarization are thought to be playing a part. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there may be other reasons fewer children received shots this year, Dr Sean O'Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said, citing reduced access to services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many pediatricians offices were understaffed and not holding as many after-hours vaccination clinics as in the past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, more Americans were seeking their vaccinations from pharmacies but some drugstores don't vaccinate children, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a GoFundMe page set up to help cover the medical costs that have amounted to $300,000, the Dahlbergs described Liam as 'a bright and smart young boy, full of life and potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'His presence brought joy and warmth to everyone he met,' the page adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Using advanced brain imaging, the researchers found that individuals with this condition showed altered activity in several brain regions related to emotion, sensation, and visual processing. These brain changes were also linked to key neurotransmitter systems that regulate reward, arousal, and muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifelong premature ejaculation is a common male sexual disorder marked by consistent early ejaculation, often within one minute of sexual activity. It can cause significant distress, affect self-esteem, and create tension in relationships. Despite its prevalence—affecting around 3% of men in China and up to 5% globally—the underlying brain mechanisms are still not fully understood. Diagnoses typically rely on self-reported measures, and objective biological markers are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers in China set out to investigate how the brains of men with lifelong premature ejaculation differ from those of men without the condition. They aimed to find measurable patterns of brain activity that could help explain why some men are affected. Their approach focused on resting-state brain function using a method called percent amplitude of fluctuation, or PerAF. This technique measures how much blood flow-related activity varies in different regions of the brain when a person is not engaged in any specific task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 81 men—46 with lifelong premature ejaculation and 35 healthy controls. All participants were screened for mental and physical health and were not taking medication. Brain scans were conducted using a 3.0 Tesla MRI scanner while participants rested with their eyes closed. The researchers then analyzed the brain imaging data to identify regions where brain activity differed between the two groups. They also compared the imaging findings with clinical measures of sexual function, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that men with premature ejaculation had increased brain activity in several key regions. These included the middle cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus, Rolandic operculum, hippocampus and parahippocampal area, and the insula. These areas are known to be involved in emotional regulation, sensory integration, and bodily awareness. At the same time, reduced activity was observed in the precuneus, inferior temporal cortex, and parts of the occipital lobe—regions linked to self-referential thinking, visual imagery, and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether these brain differences could help distinguish between individuals with and without premature ejaculation, the researchers conducted a receiver operating characteristic analysis. This statistical method estimates how accurately a variable—such as brain activity in a specific region—can classify a condition. The analysis showed that some of the altered brain regions, especially the middle cingulate cortex and hippocampus, were moderately effective in distinguishing the affected group from controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found meaningful connections between brain activity and clinical symptoms. Higher activity in the insula was associated with greater depression scores, while lower activity in the precuneus was linked to poorer sexual function. These findings suggest that emotional and cognitive processes may play a role in how premature ejaculation develops and persists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the biological underpinnings of these brain changes, the researchers investigated whether the altered activity was related to known patterns of neurotransmitter distribution. They used a brain mapping tool called JuSpace, which compares imaging data with maps of neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. The analysis showed that brain activity patterns in men with premature ejaculation were significantly correlated with areas rich in dopamine D2 receptors, serotonin transporters, norepinephrine transporters, and vesicular acetylcholine transporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurotransmitters are involved in a wide range of processes relevant to sexual function. Dopamine plays a key role in motivation, reward, and motor control. Serotonin is involved in mood regulation and is known to delay ejaculation when increased. Norepinephrine affects arousal and muscle contractions, while acetylcholine is important for communication between nerves and muscles. Imbalances in these systems may help explain why some individuals experience rapid ejaculation and emotional distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that premature ejaculation may be partly driven by a failure to balance sexual arousal and inhibitory control. This could result from dysregulation in the brain’s reward and emotional circuits, leading to faster ejaculation that is difficult to consciously control. Some scientists have proposed that premature ejaculation may resemble impulse control disorders, which share similar disruptions in neurotransmitter systems. Other studies have linked premature ejaculation to traits like anxiety, impaired self-regulation, and heightened sensitivity to sexual stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these insights, the study has some limitations. It was based on a relatively small sample and used a cross-sectional design, which means it cannot determine whether the brain differences cause the condition or are a result of it. The researchers also relied solely on functional imaging data, without combining it with structural scans or other biological measures. Future studies with larger and more diverse samples, as well as multimodal imaging approaches, may offer a more complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11682-024-00920-8" target="_blank"&gt;Abnormal percent amplitude of fluctuation in patients with lifelong premature ejaculation is associated with neurotransmitter profiles&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jiarui Yuan, Pinxiao Wang, Dingxin Nie, Wanxiang Zheng, Kepu Liu, Jianyong Feng, Yuntao Zhang, Yanzhu Wang, Junjun Gao, and Ming Gao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 18:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQMUpXSTBCbURpd0pUREd1dVhwTFRHWURteThxeG9vZ01vR1V0cE1namFlck9UT3ZrQTFXRm5LY1d1RVlzVnh3RllyS211c2QySUxKU2t6dUdIZmNyNU1DNVZyUGk4NW9od1NwcGtmTFFDT0hXaTdkYTE1cHAySm9BRFhqU2lTcmZHR3RNODhtMkcyZUp3dVFHWmkyQUhFdkxreTlZU2V4b2szQjkzM0lhVXpNMnpXbE0</guid></item><item><title>分析智能手机应用程序数据的算法可以预测多发性硬化症症状-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | Algorithm to analyze smartphone app data can predict MS symptoms - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQUFZDdnlNSEdmTHlCaFVLT1hfVzlPR0FDZVVyM0ZKSEl0SHgtYzItZ21zRnhGR0RkM295a1hMZkp5Yi1manNERGVKU1BzT294TWFld0lvaXV1WTk1UHE2cTUtTUVxWmxVSzNsNDNBTmVhUW9rTjRhQmVMR0Z2U29jUUtxLVQtUDM4ZDVIaGhYRDZXNDl0WlM0WHFTSmNCMHhOMGIyQWlaeHpGTEhlNjVRSEZVdlJwUm5RdGRZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms to analyze data collected on a smartphone app could predict whether a person with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) will experience certain high-severity &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; in the next three months, a study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe this will help empower patients to better understand their disease and work more easily with their healthcare team to make disease management decisions. The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63888-x"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Performance of machine learning models for predicting high-severity symptoms in multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system erroneously attacks healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord. Disease symptoms and severity can vary widely depending on which regions are most affected, and the extent of the damage. Typically, people with MS have clinical assessments a couple times a year, along with an annual &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scan&lt;/a&gt;, but these infrequent snapshots may not be enough to fully capture how it’s impacting their life between visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital monitoring tools like smartphone apps could fill this gap and enable collection of a wide range of data on a daily basis. In turn, AI algorithms can analyze the data and make predictions about disease progression to aid clinical decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Mobile technology enables continual collection of data and can pave the path for predicting complex aspects of MS such as symptoms and disease courses,” the researchers wrote. “We might learn what symptoms MS subjects are likely to develop, why they are experiencing the ones they have, and what treatments are more suited for their current disease burden.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Helping patients manage their disease&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An observational study called &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02845635"&gt;MS Mosaic (NCT02845635)&lt;/a&gt; was initiated to collect data from adults with MS in the U.S. via a mobile app over three years. The app was developed by scientists at Duke University in North Carolina and was made available for download during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants completed tasks that included demographic surveys, daily MS symptom reporting, and other active functional tests. The smartphone also passively collected data related to step counts, sleep, and heart rate. The researchers then partnered with Google data scientists to develop AI algorithms that would continuously predict when symptoms might occur. The analyses included data from 713 people who used the app for at least three months, most of whom had MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists tested several different approaches to predict on a weekly basis if a person would have any of five MS symptoms — &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/fatigue-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, sensory disturbances, walking instability, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-and-mental-health/"&gt;depression or anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, and muscle cramps or spasms — with at least moderate severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team honed in on one type of algorithm that had the best predictive abilities, with a diagnostic accuracy between 80%-90% for each symptom. This model was particularly accurate considering all the evaluated features collected from the smartphone, but what seemed most important for predicting future symptoms was a past history of that symptom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that feature was removed from the algorithm, its predictive abilities declined, though it could still achieve a fairly high performance by looking at the totality of other data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This highlights the importance of considering all available data collectively, which proves the need for methods that can analyze a wide range of data simultaneously,” wrote the researchers, noting an app-based method for predicting MS symptoms showed it could give patients more certainty in their daily lives. “Symptomatic uncertainties associated with MS can have a substantial impact on quality of life, as individuals struggle to anticipate how they will feel each day, whether their symptoms will impede daily tasks, or know if particular symptoms originate from their MS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By focusing on actionable prediction of high-severity symptoms, the algorithm described here could improve anticipatory guidance and symptom management,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a person knows their ability to walk might soon decline, they can consider &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/physiotherapy/"&gt;physical therapy&lt;/a&gt; or other interventions before this happens. The app was designed to provide patients with a symptom summary report that may facilitate such conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, “this approach has the potential to empower subjects as experts of their own experience in order to improve symptom management, and to optimize the often-limited interactions with physicians and clinical experts,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Fudan University, the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics, the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Shaoxin Laboratory, all in China, has developed a retinal prosthesis woven from metal nanowires that partially restored vision in blind mice.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																					&lt;p&gt;In their paper &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu2987" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;, the group describes how they created tellurium nanowires and interlaced them to create a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/retinal+prosthesis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retinal prosthesis&lt;/a&gt;. Eduardo Fernández, with University Miguel Hernández, in Spain, has published a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady4439" target="_blank"&gt;Perspective&lt;/a&gt; piece in the same journal issue outlining the work done by the team on this new effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a way to cure blindness has been a major goal for scientists for many years, and such efforts have paid off for some types of blindness, such as those caused by cataracts. Other types of blindness associated with damage to the retina, however, have proven too difficult to overcome in most cases. For this research, the team in China tried a new approach to treating such types of blindness by building a mesh out of a semiconductor and affixing it to the back of the eye, where it could send signals to the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/optic+nerve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;optic nerve&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work involved fabricating nanowires out of tellurium and then interlacing them to form a mesh. Tellurium was chosen for the project because it can directly convert &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/light+energy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;light energy&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/electrical+energy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electrical energy&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/light+irradiation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;light irradiation&lt;/a&gt; without the need for an additional power supply. The electrical energy produced was then funneled to the optic nerve where it was processed by the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing involved implanting the nanoprostheses in the eyes of mice with bioengineered &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/blindness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blindness&lt;/a&gt;. To test the effectiveness of the implants, the research team conducted imaging and electrophysiological recording of the nerves leading into the optic nerves and signals that were carried to the brain and found activity not present in a control group. They also found that the implants resulted in restored pupil reflexes along with neuron firing, which were also not present in a control group. The implanted mice were also able to turn toward an LED light and to respond to pattern testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prosthesis also allowed for processing near-infrared light, which, the researchers suggest, could lead to the development of devices that could provide sharper color contrast and better night vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Nucleus Genomics, a genetic testing startup founded by 25-year-old Kian Sadeghi, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/nucleus-genomics-lands-new-funding-from-alexis-ohanian-to-help-people-assess-specific-disease-risks/?guccounter=1"&gt;initially launched in 2021 &lt;/a&gt;with the goal of calculating a patient’s risk for specific diseases. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But it’s been courting controversy for years with products that claim to tell people how their genetics correlate to a host of complex issues, including their IQ. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;On Wednesday, it ratcheted up the controversy to an earsplitting level when it announced a new product called Nucleus Embryo &lt;a href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics/status/1930293851383615752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;with a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that said: “Every parent wants to give their children more than they had. For the first time in human history, Nucleus adds a new tool to that commitment.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus says it can test IVF embryos not just for well-known specific genes that have a high chance of illnesses like breast cancer, but also for appearance — sex, height, hair color, eye color — as well as IQ and complex health attributes like anxiety and ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;The launch video includes a screenshot of a comparison menu. The idea is to help parents choose which embryos to pick and which ones to, perhaps, discard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Genetic testing of embryos isn’t unheard of. IVF physicians &lt;a href="https://www.froedtert.com/fertility/genetic-screening/pgd-chromosomal-abnormalities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;can test for&lt;/a&gt; genes that can cause conditions like Down syndrome, or when parents know they are of high risk for a particular genetic disorder, like cystic fibrosis. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;But that’s not exactly what Nucleus is doing. It is using controversial “polygenic scores” to determine “complex genetic outcomes, like intelligence and anxiety,” a spokesperson says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, polygenic scores only calculate the probabilities of a certain complex illness occurring, mainly within populations. “A polygenic risk score can only explain the relative risk for a disease,” &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Health/Genomics-and-Medicine/Polygenic-risk-scores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;the NHGR says&lt;/a&gt;. This is not the same as discovering a specific gene, such as the BRCA1 gene mutation, which gives a person a 60% to 80% “absolute risk of breast cancer,” the NHGR says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;There’s a reason doctors don’t typically use such tests for individuals. “Polygenic risk scores are not yet routinely used by health professionals because there are no guidelines for practice and researchers are still improving how these scores are generated,” according to the NHGR.  &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus defends that its method can be used to determine an individual’s risk. The spokesperson pointed us to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0183-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;a 2018 paper&lt;/a&gt; where the authors said they had developed validated methods for five common diseases: coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;That paper was advocating screenings to help individuals make lifestyle or therapeutic decisions, similar to Nucleus’s initial concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Wednesday’s tweet was promising parents that Nucleus can help them create designer babies. It has now been viewed more than 4 million times and has hundreds of comments, many of them either expressing disbelief that this works as promised, or horror at the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://x.com/maxniederhofer/status/1930551749531574421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;VC chimed&lt;/a&gt; into the discussion saying, “I was going to type something like Noah get the boat but honestly the reality of this just makes me so nauseous.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus has experienced this kind of controversy before, as &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/30/controversial-genetics-testing-startup-nucleus-genomics-raises-14m-series-a/"&gt;TechCrunch previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, when it announced its $14 million Series A earlier this year. The startup is backed by Founders Fund; Alexis Ohanian’s 776; &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/15/nucleus-genomics-lands-new-funding-from-alexis-ohanian-to-help-people-assess-specific-disease-risks/?guccounter=1"&gt;and angels, including&lt;/a&gt; Adrian Aoun (CEO at Forward Health), Brent Saunders (former CEO at Allergan), and Matteo Franceschetti (CEO at Eight Sleep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Last year, Sadeghi launched Nucleus IQ, which is supposed to tell users how much their genetics influence intelligence. The product was blasted &lt;a href="https://nepc.colorado.edu/blog/genetic-iq-tests#:~:text=On%20the%20ethical%20side%2C%20too,race%20as%20a%20biological%20category." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;as “bad science and big business”&lt;/a&gt; by some critics. Sadeghi &lt;a href="https://nucleusgenomics.substack.com/p/genetics-can-predict-height-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;published a lengthy defense &lt;/a&gt;of his company’s methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Even so, telling adults that they are genetically smart is one thing. Telling IVF parents that they can choose the appearance and other complex attributes for their children is, &lt;a href="https://x.com/nucleusgenomics/status/1930293851383615752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;many would argue&lt;/a&gt;, something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Nucleus &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/embryo-ivf-screening-longevity-2b1f096a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;is not currently conducting such tests via IVF lab partners&lt;/a&gt; itself, The Wall Street Journal reports. It’s partnering with Genomic Prediction, which works with IVF clinics. A Genomic executive told the WSJ that many parents request intelligence tests, and it doesn’t provide that. Parents can voluntarily upload genetic data information to Nucleus if they want to pursue it. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p class="wp-block-paragraph"&gt;Or, as Sadeghi said in the launch video aimed at would-be parents: “Not that long ago, IVF-1 sparked fear and the stigma of test tube babies,” he said. “What was once controversial is now an everyday practice. The same is true with genetic optimization. The technology is now here and it’s here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;

But beyond its culinary charm, rosemary is also &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/266370"&gt;gaining recognition&lt;/a&gt; for its impressive health benefits, especially when it comes to brain health, inflammation and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/rosemary-compound-enhances-brain-connections-and-memory-in-alzheimers-model/"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; rosemary may even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45168-1"&gt;hold promise&lt;/a&gt; in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;dementia worldwide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, rosemary has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8851910/"&gt;linked to memory and mental clarity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://daily.jstor.org/rosemary-the-herb-of-ritual-and-remembrance/"&gt;In ancient Greece and Rome&lt;/a&gt;, students and scholars used rosemary in the hope of sharpening concentration and recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern science is finding there may have been something in this: &lt;a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/2016/04/herbs-that-can-boost-your-mood-and-memory/"&gt;in one study&lt;/a&gt;, people who inhaled rosemary’s scent performed better on memory tasks compared to those in an unscented environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does rosemary work on the brain? There are several mechanisms at play. For starters, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7491497/"&gt;rosemary stimulates&lt;/a&gt; blood circulation, including to the brain, helping deliver more oxygen and nutrients, which may improve mental clarity. It also has calming properties; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9297920/"&gt;some studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; its aroma can reduce anxiety and improve sleep. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7879075/"&gt;Lower stress can mean&lt;/a&gt; better focus and memory retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary contains compounds that &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/6/1547"&gt;interact with the brain’s neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt;. One such compound, 1,8-cineole, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2045125312436573"&gt;helps prevent the breakdown&lt;/a&gt; of acetylcholine, a brain chemical essential for learning and memory. By preserving acetylcholine, rosemary &lt;a href="https://www.ijpsjournal.com/article/Therapeutic+Effect+of+Rosemary+and+Its+Active+Constituent+on+Nervous+System+Disorders++"&gt;may help support cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt;, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another bonus? Rosemary is &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/10/5/714"&gt;packed with antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;, which help protect brain cells from damage caused by oxidative stress – a major factor in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is rich in phytochemicals, plant compounds with health-enhancing effects. One of the most powerful is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661824002330"&gt;carnosic acid&lt;/a&gt;, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7491497/"&gt;helps shield brain cells from harm&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from the kinds of damage linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/14/3/293"&gt;researchers developed&lt;/a&gt; a stable version of carnosic acid called diAcCA. In promising pre-clinical studies, this compound improved memory, boosted the number of synapses (the connections between brain cells), and reduced harmful Alzheimer’s related proteins like amyloid-beta and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s especially exciting is that diAcCA only activates in inflamed brain regions, which could minimise side effects. So far, studies in mice show no signs of toxicity and significant cognitive improvements – raising hopes that human trials could be next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also believe diAcCA could help treat other inflammatory conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary’s benefits could extend &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7491497/#B5"&gt;well beyond the brain&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been used traditionally to ease digestion, relieve bloating and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounds like rosmarinic acid and ursolic acid are known for their anti-inflammatory effects throughout the body. Rosemary may even benefit the skin – &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10045493/"&gt;a review suggests&lt;/a&gt; it can help soothe acne and eczema, while carnosic acid may offer anti-ageing benefits by protecting skin from sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6165352/"&gt;Rosemary oil&lt;/a&gt; also has antimicrobial properties, showing promise in food preservation and potential pharmaceutical applications by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, rosemary is &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/266370#safety"&gt;safe when used&lt;/a&gt; in food, teas or aromatherapy. But concentrated doses or extracts can pose risks. &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/old-man-rosmarinus-officinalis-linn-rosemary-344476#4"&gt;Consuming large amounts&lt;/a&gt; may cause vomiting or, in rare cases, seizures – particularly in people with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a &lt;a href="https://reference.medscape.com/drug/old-man-rosmarinus-officinalis-linn-rosemary-344476#5"&gt;theoretical risk&lt;/a&gt; of rosemary stimulating uterine contractions, so pregnant people should avoid high doses. Because rosemary &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/rosemary-tea#Potential-drug-interactions"&gt;can interact with some medications&lt;/a&gt; – such as blood thinners – it’s best to check with a healthcare provider before taking large amounts in supplement form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is more than just a kitchen staple. It’s a natural remedy with ancient roots and modern scientific backing. As research continues, particularly into breakthrough compounds like diAcCA, rosemary could play an exciting role in future treatments for Alzheimer’s and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, adding a little rosemary to your life – whether in a meal, a cup of tea, or a breath of its fragrant oil – could be a small step with big health benefits.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256920/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256920/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

The genetic molecules then instruct the cells to make the virus visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author and Doherty Institute research fellow Paula Cevaal told the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt; that it was "previously thought impossible" to deliver mRNA into HIV-containing white blood cells. But thanks to a new type of LNPs, dubbed LNP X, the team found a way for these cells to accept the mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our hope is that this new nanoparticle design could be a new pathway to an HIV cure," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human immunodeficiency virus attacks the human body's immune system and can lead to deadly AIDS if left untreated. Despite decades of research, there's still no effective cure for the disease; though a &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/first-woman-cured-hiv" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;handful of patients have been fully cured of HIV&lt;/a&gt;, the treatments remain brutally complex and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the number of people in the United States living with HIV has decreased since 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv-data/nhss/hiv-diagnoses-deaths-and-prevalence-2025.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;over 39,000 new patients&lt;/a&gt; were diagnosed in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research came with such surprising findings that the team didn't believe it at first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were overwhelmed by how [much of a] night and day difference it was — from not working before, and then all of a sudden it was working. And all of us were just sitting gasping like, 'wow,'" Cevaal told the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it's a promising step in the right direction, scientists still have to figure out whether making the hidden virus visible will cause the body's immune system to deal with it. Other possibilities include developing new ways to combine their findings with other gene therapies to ultimately cure HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the latest technique can be used in humans, it would also have to be put through its paces, from animal experiments to human safety trials, a process that could easily take many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Cevaal appears to be realistic about those chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the field of biomedicine, many things eventually don’t make it into the clinic — that is the unfortunate truth; I don’t want to paint a prettier picture than what is the reality," she told the &lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. "But in terms of specifically the field of HIV cure, we have never seen anything close to as good as what we are seeing, in terms of how well we are able to reveal this virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So from that point of view, we’re very hopeful that we are also able to see this type of response in an animal, and that we could eventually do this in humans," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond HIV, the researchers are hoping their LNP-based mRNA delivery method could be applied to other diseases as well, including certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on HIV:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/conservatives-prep-insurance-uconstitutional" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Religious Conservatives Trying to End Insurance Coverage of Incredibly Effective Anti-HIV Drug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>futurism.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 16:58:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9wX1B0N18wQ1FUY1pkZXdFWEN4Q3p5MlVLZEVXaE4zTFJNZ1loNmFLaFVGWHduR3ZWWFF1cGhwZDlZb3hYdG9KNmNpZHBkSmk1VlY5ZDRBRmllRnlYb2NGNG8wQzZZMi1vcWItUTRpUFI</guid></item><item><title>DBS之前的认知变化不是帕金森氏症的痴呆风险因素-帕金森氏症今日新闻 | Cognitive changes before DBS not a dementia risk factor in Parkinson’s - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOTzVnQVFNR1lGcy1BWC1CMTZwRXViSVl6Vm9KTUtMemhtQjFvcHFtRXRUOXBQQmgxdVJFTnc5ZTRsdkhMbS1tRW0ycHVrSjk5aGc5UkRTOTRwYnBOanpPQmNIaGZnYUZVdTkxZEV6ckl1dUlBc2NNRHdJbUxqc3AzY0lCcHJseloyWDdsTlEyZkNjQnpYclpqQ0YxRFlEcEo5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; who have mild cognitive changes before &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-treatments/surgical-treatments/"&gt;deep brain stimulation&lt;/a&gt; (DBS) are not more likely to develop dementia later in life than those whose cognitive function was normal before the surgery, a Danish study has found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers observed that dementia was more likely to develop among those who had been &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-tests-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; for a longer duration at the time of the surgical procedure. This was found regardless of the patients’ ages, sex, or level of education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disease duration, but not presurgical MCI [mild cognitive impairment] was associated with development of dementia,” the team wrote, noting that “influence on cognition” was detailed in “a short- and long-term follow-up study up to 15 years” following DBS surgery among patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Titled “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1877718X251334049"&gt;Mild cognitive impairment is not predictive of dementia up to 15 years after subthalamic deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” the study was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;After DBS, verbal fluency, other cognitive skills seen to decline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In DBS, small electrodes are placed into deep areas of the brain. These electrodes are connected by thin wires to a device called a pulse generator, which sends mild electrical pulses to regulate brain activity and ease the &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that are a hallmark of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these symptoms, many people with Parkinson’s experience cognitive changes that often begin as mild cognitive impairment — small but noticeable problems with attention, planning, or memory beyond those of normal aging. When these problems become severe enough to interfere with daily life, doctors refer to it as dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive impairment and dementia are common in [the] later stages of Parkinson’s,” the researchers wrote. However, little is known about the long-term effects of DBS on cognition. Such a study, the team noted, “must take into consideration the progression of disease, as well as the background risk of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how DBS affects cognitive function in the long term, the researchers followed 81 patients who had been living with Parkinson’s for an average of 13 years. Half of them already exhibited signs of mild cognitive impairment before surgery, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months after DBS, all of the patients showed significantly worse verbal fluency, indicated by how quickly they could name words in a certain category or words starting with a specific letter, or switch between types of words. Other cognitive skills also showed some decline, but the changes weren’t large enough to be considered significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Parkinson’s patients with depression more likely to develop dementia&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 29 patients were followed for up to 15 years. Among them, about two-thirds developed mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Six, or 21%, had signs of cognitive changes but no clinical diagnosis of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four patients — all women — had normal cognitive function. On average, these four were younger at the time of surgery (47.4 years vs. 57.5 years) than the others in the study. They also had Parkinson’s for a shorter duration before surgery (8.5 years vs. 12 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No link was found between having mild cognitive impairment before surgery and later developing dementia. About 51% of those with early cognitive changes developed dementia, compared with 55% of those who had normal cognitive function before surgery, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Disease duration and … depressive symptoms before surgery were associated with the later development of clinically diagnosed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/living-with-parkinsons-disease-2/"&gt;living with Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; for a longer time before surgery was linked to a higher likelihood of developing dementia. For each additional year of living with the disease before surgery, the odds of developing dementia later increased by about 20%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before surgery, about a third of patients had symptoms of depression, which may occur as a &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptom&lt;/a&gt; of Parkinson’s and be &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/news/parkinsons-depression-linked-with-low-cognitive-function-sex-drive/"&gt;linked to low cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;. Patients with symptoms of depression were more likely to develop dementia later, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Disease duration and … depressive symptoms before surgery were associated with the later development of clinically diagnosed dementia,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a limitation of the study, the researchers noted the “relatively small” number of patients. This, as well as a lack of a control group, “[make] it difficult to draw a conclusion” on all data, the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The study is meant to be hypothesis-generating, and results should be further tested in other studies,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

The Department of Health and Human Services, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health all use Foundry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Some officials worry that a sprawling data collection system could expose or endanger people with sensitive health needs, like gender care, reproductive health care or disabilities. Some labor and other advocacy groups have tried to block the Trump administration from sharing data across agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

teenager has revealed how she discovered that a lump in her neck she thought was from a lingering cold was actually &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-4a72d4c0-42ec-11f0-82b5-9f8a2ce8202c"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2025, Makaila Chenier, 17, found a 'little lump' in her neck but ignored it - believing it was a swollen lymph node due to a cold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the lump 'got progressively bigger' months before she was meant to graduate high school and she had trouble breathing while lying down, the teenager decided to visit a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikaila's mother, Christina Chenier recalled her daughter saying: 'Look, the lump on my neck has gotten a lot bigger. I can feel it. It's on the other side now, and I feel like I'm being choked when I lay down.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The high school student was referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist, who, after seeing the severity of her situation, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14786781/Healthy-woman-bowel-cancer-young-people-ultraprocessed-food.html"&gt;advised her to quickly go to the emergency department.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was definitely a sense of urgency that we picked up on very quickly in the appointments,' Christina said. 'We knew something wasn't quite right.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the ED, Makaila underwent an ultrasound, X-ray and CT scan. The tests revealed she was suffering from Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, an important part of the body's immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The lymphatic system is widespread across the body, it includes bone marrow, the spleen, tonsils and tissue in the small intestine, and Hodgkin lymphoma limits the body's ability to fight infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Makaila Chenier, 17, has revealed how she discovered that a normal post-cold lump in her neck was a sign that she was suffering from Stage 2 Hodgkin lymphoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikaila told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/teen-thought-she-had-swollen-lymph-node-from-cold-turned-out-to-be-cancer-11748698"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/a&gt;: 'It was very hard because it was like everything changed literally overnight. It was just a little lump.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being diagnosed with the disease, which is expected to effect 8,700 Americans this year, the teenager was transferred to Texas Children's Hospital where doctors conducted a biopsy of her lymph nodes and uncovered the extent of her cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was stage 2, meaning the cancer was present in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are all on the same side of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The estimated survival rate for stage 2 is between 93 and 95 percent. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 1,150 deaths from Hodgkin lymphoma this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother added: 'I'm not sure why I thought to look at my watch, but 8:02 pm on Friday, February 18, 2025, will be permanently etched in my memory because that was the moment when everything changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'All of a sudden we were playing a completely different game and everything was completely upside down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikaila was admitted to the intensive care unit because doctors were worried about 'the airway constriction' in her neck due to the lump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Christina said: 'They were concerned that she may have trouble breathing at any point. They felt it was the best place for her.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma include swelling of lymph nodes in the neck, armpits or groin, fever, tiredness, night sweats, weight loss and tiredness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment often involves two to four rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy - which doctors advised Mikaila undergo a week and a half after she was diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Makaila pictured here at her graduation with her cat, Walter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Hodgkin lymphoma, Stage 2 means the cancer is present in two or more groups of lymph nodes that are all on the same side of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As of now, the high schooler has finished her seventh round of chemotherapy and has five more to go. Doctors expect her treatment to end by August 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After the first cycle of chemo, they kept me for two or three days after to monitor and make sure I was responding well,' Makaila told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/teen-mistook-lump-neck-cold-symptom-lymphoma-rcna210888"&gt;TODAY.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She showed no serious reactions after her first round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of now, the teenager has finished her seventh round of chemotherapy and has five more to go. Doctors expect her treatment to end by August 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is currently receiving infusions every two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the frequency of her treatment and side effects, Mikaila was forced to drop out of school and is now being homeschooled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Initially it was a lot of tiredness. I slept probably for the whole next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I get really bad nerve pain in my jaw and my tongue and then I will also get bone pain in my legs.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there was one milestone the teen didn't want to miss out on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After graduation and chemotherapy, the teen plans to take a gap year before starting college to become a pediatric nurse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They let me do graduation because that's once in a lifetime,' she told TODAY.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After graduation and chemotherapy, she plans to take a gap year before starting college to become a pediatric nurse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been staying really positive through it all and I've learned that really helps get through it because they say time flies when you're having fun,' Makaila said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I try to have as much fun as I can and make the best out of it, which has really helped.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;South Shore Health declined to answer questions about whether the health care system was treating suspected cases or how many it was seeing, referring instead to the Department of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However Dr. Jason Tracy, chief medical officer at the health system, said generally that patients are given a presumptive diagnosis made off of their clinical presentation of symptoms and history of recent injections. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;From there, the hospital would involve both the Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control, which has an anti-toxin that it provides on a case-by-case basis. The anti-toxin helps slow the progression of symptoms, but does not reverse them, and so hospitals typically also provide supportive measures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is quite rare,“ Tracy said. ”This is different than a food-borne botulism type case.

The powerful toxin, produced by a bacteria, blocks the ability of the nervous system to activate muscles. It has become known worldwide for its ability to both soften and prevent wrinkles, and it is the most common cosmetic procedure administered worldwide, with an estimated 3 million injections done annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Cosmetic treatments with botulinum toxin use doses much lower than for medical treatments, said Dr. Mathew M. Avram, director of the Mass. General Hospital Dermatology Laser and Cosmetic Center. With regulated, FDA-approved products in a healthy adult, the amount of the toxin is so small that it is exceedingly rare for it to cause botulism. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I’ve never seen a patient or had a colleague of mine at Mass. General or elsewhere that has told me they have had a case of this. It is not something that happens normally,” Avram said. “Someone would have to go outside the realm of what you would typically inject to encounter these issues, for a typical patient.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Beyond injecting far too much, poor administration technique or using counterfeit products can increase risks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We have seen instances where injectors have used counterfeit products or products they developed on their own,” Avram said. “These are unsafe practices that can harm patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to the advisory, botulism results when the botulinum toxin circulates in the blood. Symptoms including double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. Such symptoms are sometimes followed by muscle weaknesses, which can progress over the course of hours or days. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;DPH has asked clinicians to warn patients interested in these cosmetic injections of the potential risks, and is advising patients to receive injections only from licensed providers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If someone has had a botox injection and has had those symptoms they should seek medical attention,” Tracy said. “I don’t want to create worry but someone having visual changes, slurred speech and difficulty swallowing — they should not ignore it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The reports are only the latest Botox problems to surface in the South Shore. In November, 38-year-old Rebecca Fadanelli, was arrested and charged with selling counterfeit Botox out of Skin Beauté Med Spa in Easton and Randolph. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/spa-owner-arrested-allegedly-performing-thousands-illegal-counterfeit-injections-clients" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/spa-owner-arrested-allegedly-performing-thousands-illegal-counterfeit-injections-clients"&gt;Prosecutors say&lt;/a&gt; Fandanelli had for years imported counterfeit Botox, Sculptra, and Juvederm from China and Brazil and performed over a thousand injections, receiving over $900,000 in client payments. Though she represented to clients and employees that she was a nurse, prosecutors said she is an aesthetician and wasn’t properly licensed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

            Maybe you have decided that the voice inside your head judging yourself or others for&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;body size can be pretty mean, but at least it’s encouraging weight loss, right?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif00083b6mxjj0onz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No, it’s not, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif00093b6mgcd4cyow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has long been a misunderstanding … that if you shame people about their weight, then that will lead them to eat less or to eat more healthfully or to exercise more in order to lose weight,” said Dr. Rebecca Pearl, associate professor of clinical and health psychology at the University of Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000a3b6mkulgma5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What the research, though, has shown over and over again is that that is not true,” Pearl said. “It actually has the opposite effect.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000b3b6mptjwuju7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stigma around weight and body size is everywhere: in US culture, messages from people around you and even at your doctor’s office, Pearl said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000c3b6mpqdmaac0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One study found that after bariatric surgery, experiencing continued weight stigma was associated with higher risks of depression, anxiety and disordered eating such as binge eating. Those who experienced less weight stigma were more likely to continue losing weight and maintain weight loss, according to the &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/hea0001517" target="_blank"&gt;study published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Health Psychology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000d3b6me4e2k6kk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And not only are biases around weight damaging to mental health, they also are counterproductive if people want to lose weight or engage in more health-promoting behaviors, said first study author Dr. Larissa McGarrity, clinical psychologist in physical medicine and rehabilitation at University of Utah Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000e3b6mj7j9u0rj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Weight stigma centers around a pervasive public misconception: that what a person weighs is entirely within a person’s control.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000f3b6m2jjgzvpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As a result of that, people should just be able to eat healthy on their own, to lose weight on their own, to be physically active –– that’s their personal responsibility to do that,” said Pearl, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000g3b6mlov3ghqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a person doesn’t lose weight or comes up against barriers to that thin body ideal –– such as lack of access to nutritious and affordable foods, no place for physical activity, or their genetics –– the misconception says their body shape is a sign of a moral failing, said Dr. Alexis Conason, a psychologist and certified eating disorder specialist in New York City who also did not participate in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000h3b6mol10sf9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Messages saying that a person has a responsibility to lose weight and is a worse person if they do not can come from images or storylines in television and social media, direct comments from people you know, and bullying or discrimination, Pearl said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000i3b6mt7ov13x0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It gets worse when a person absorbs those derogatory remarks from others about their body weight and applies it to themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000j3b6m9f5i5py7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Experiencing stigma from other people is harmful,” Pearl said. “But for the individuals who really internalize that, that seems to be a really strong predictor of these negative eating and physical activity outcomes, but also kind of broader mental and physical health outcomes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000k3b6m38po2862@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physical activity is so important to many aspects of health, including &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/health/strength-training-live-longer-wellness"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/10/health/exercise-depression-wellness"&gt;management of depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/health/insomnia-exercise-wellness"&gt;better sleep&lt;/a&gt; and lower &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/28/health/one-minute-exercise-cancer-wellness"&gt;cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000l3b6moh96wsak@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People often have a hard time going to the gym or getting outside for exercise, because it can feel intimidating or overwhelming, said Dr. A. Janet Tomiyama, professor of psychology at the University of California Los Angeles who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000m3b6m8mxermw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is particularly hard if you know you will get comments, judgment or even just extra attention because of your weight, Conason added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000n3b6mbbkf0fei@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827321000306" target="_blank"&gt;Research has linked&lt;/a&gt; experiencing and internalizing weight stigma to less motivation and enjoyment of physical activity, less confidence about exercising, and less time spent exercising, Pearl said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000o3b6m4xcdd58m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A gym is a location where a lot of weight stigma and fat shaming can happen,” said Tomiyama. “If you’ve been stigmatized for the way you look, the last thing you want to do is put on some tight clothes and go to a gym.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000p3b6mxo58pel6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Being judged for your body can be distressing, which can impact food choices.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000q3b6m6gojggtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When someone is teased or criticized, or even just feels like they’re getting negative looks from other people around them, that is stressful,” Pearl said. “We know that one of the very common ways that everybody copes with stress is by eating more and eating more unhealthy kinds of foods.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000r3b6mx7k0sptu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Stress eating isn’t a behavior we need to shake our finger and shame people out of either, Tomiyama said. It is in our own biology as well as that of other animals, she added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000s3b6myxjyva37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Physical or psychological stress signals your body to release the hormone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cortisol, Tomiyama said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000t3b6md77pa1xz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the things that cortisol does, is it works on our brain to really activate reward processes that make high-sugar, high-salt, high-calorie&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;food taste really, really good,” she added. “And so, at a brain level, it’s making these potentially health harming foods way harder to resist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000u3b6mmhwly9gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cortisol also blocks the parts of your brain that help you make decisions that benefit you in the long term, Tomiyama said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000v3b6mknwpvdsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666316300332" target="_blank"&gt;Research has linked&lt;/a&gt; exposure to weight stigma and unhealthy, disordered eating behaviors such as binge eating, purging and unhealthy restriction –– all of which undermine health, Pearl said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000w3b6m4425ehgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unfortunately, weight stigma is pervasive, and it isn’t something you can snap your fingers and rid yourself of, Conason said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000x3b6mgkot1tp4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One step the medical field can take is to de-emphasize body mass index, or BMI, as an important marker of health, especially because it often classifies healthy people as unhealthy and those with health issues as falling into a healthy weight class, Tomiyama said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000y3b6mxva1v89x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When working with clients,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Conason also focuses on creating resiliency, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif000z3b6mbytuuhsf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We may not be able to change the entire culture, but we can try to understand that the problem is the culture, not our bodies,” Conason said. “That can provide resiliency around moving through the world and experiencing weight stigma and trying not to internalize the stigma.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif00103b6mqf5r9gqy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Conason does this by helping clients build greater self-compassion, educating them on the ways in which a culture of weight stigma has influenced them, and encouraging the practice of acceptance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbkwalif00113b6m2k7i74z5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you notice an internalized weight stigma is affecting your behavior, contacting a disordered eating mental health counselor&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;or a weight-inclusive dietitian may be a helpful first step.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The researchers found that these cognitive traits do not influence depression symptoms directly but through their effects on how individuals regulate emotions—particularly through patterns such as rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder is one of the most widespread mental health conditions, yet its treatment continues to face challenges related to recurrence and treatment resistance. While cognitive models of depression have long proposed that emotion regulation strategies and cognitive impairments play key roles in maintaining the disorder, these models often treat these components in isolation. In reality, individuals tend to use multiple emotion regulation strategies simultaneously, and cognitive abilities like processing speed and flexibility may influence how people manage emotions in complex ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aimed to move beyond simplified models and instead capture the interactions between emotion regulation strategies, cognitive processes, and depression. They used a network analysis approach, which treats each element as a “node” in a system and models how these nodes influence one another. This method offers a more realistic representation of how depression develops and persists by focusing on the interconnectivity of psychological components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://danielcastro.notion.site/daniel-castro-d8bef0038cf14edeb6503f73f50f4926" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Castro&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at the University of Maia, explained that his interest in this topic stems from two main motivations. “First, my interest in the capabilities of explanation of psychological phenomena from a network perspective, which differs from traditional approaches that impose a medical perspective on psychological phenomena—one that is distant from the clinical perspective used to explain them. Second, the interest in understanding, from this perspective, what insights into depression development might be obtained when studying the interaction between cognitive processes, cognitive emotion regulation strategies, and depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from 227 healthy participants from the Leipzig Study for Mind-Body-Emotion Interactions, which included both young adults (ages 20–35) and older adults (ages 59–77). For this study, the researchers focused on two cognitive processes: processing speed and cognitive flexibility. Processing speed refers to how quickly a person can take in, understand, and respond to information, while cognitive flexibility is the ability to shift between different thoughts, tasks, or perspectives as needed. These were assessed using the Trail Making Test, a neuropsychological tool where participants connect a series of numbers and letters under time constraints. Shorter completion times indicated better performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, although participants in this sample were not clinically depressed. Emotion regulation strategies were evaluated with the Cognitive Emotional Regulation Questionnaire, which includes subscales such as rumination, positive reappraisal, self-blame, and catastrophizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rumination&lt;/strong&gt; involves repeatedly thinking about distressing experiences or negative emotions, often without reaching a resolution, which can intensify feelings of sadness or hopelessness. &lt;strong&gt;Positive reappraisal&lt;/strong&gt; is a strategy where individuals try to reinterpret a negative situation in a more positive or meaningful way, helping to reduce emotional distress. &lt;strong&gt;Self-blame&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when people attribute negative events to their own character or actions, often leading to guilt or shame. &lt;strong&gt;Catastrophizing&lt;/strong&gt; is the tendency to assume the worst possible outcome in a situation, which can increase anxiety and feelings of helplessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a network modeling method known as Mixed Graphical Models to estimate the structure of interactions between cognitive processes, emotion regulation strategies, and depression. They then evaluated each node’s influence in the network and simulated how changes in processing speed and cognitive flexibility might impact the network as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, neither processing speed nor cognitive flexibility had a direct link to depression symptoms. Instead, their influence was mediated through cognitive emotion regulation strategies—especially rumination. This suggests that while these cognitive abilities are important, they may shape mental health outcomes indirectly by altering how people regulate their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicate that “emotion regulation strategies directly influence depression and that difficulties in cognitive processes influence emotion regulation strategies,” Castro told PsyPost. “This suggests that cognitive processes might promote difficulties in emotion regulation, which might then impact depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the network, rumination emerged as a central node with the highest influence. It also served as the shortest path between the cognitive processes and depression, highlighting its pivotal role. Catastrophizing and positive reappraisal were also highly central in the network, reinforcing the idea that emotion regulation strategies are at the heart of depressive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to the cognitive processes, the two played different roles. Processing speed showed high “bridge centrality,” meaning it served as a connector between different parts of the network. This suggests that improving processing speed might be effective for preventing depression by weakening harmful connections or preventing them from forming. However, its effect on reducing overall symptom activity was modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive flexibility, on the other hand, had a more substantial effect on the overall network. Simulations showed that higher cognitive flexibility reduced overall network connectivity—a finding consistent with the idea that lower connectivity is associated with fewer depressive symptoms. This implies that training aimed at improving cognitive flexibility might be more effective in symptom reduction than efforts focused on processing speed alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From the two cognitive processes studied, only processing speed was related to emotion regulation strategies, even though cognitive flexibility had a bigger impact on the network connectivity,” Castro said. “Since network connectivity has been suggested to identify psychopathological states, difficulties in cognitive flexibility might promote the development of psychopathological disorders, but the impact on depression only happens through processing speed and emotion regulation strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also ran simulations where they set the cognitive processes to their highest or lowest observed values and measured changes in the network’s overall activity. When both processing speed and flexibility were high, network activity decreased, suggesting a healthier mental state. When both were low, network activity increased, indicating more vulnerability to depressive symptoms. The simulations reinforced the idea that these cognitive processes interact with emotion regulation strategies in complex ways that cannot be captured by simpler models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, the study comes with limitations. The sample consisted of healthy individuals, which may limit how well the findings apply to people with clinical depression. Since the depression score was based on a single overall rating rather than individual symptoms like fatigue or anhedonia, the model may have missed important connections. Future studies should include more detailed assessments to better capture the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation lies in the tools used to measure cognitive flexibility and processing speed. The Trail Making Test is a common assessment tool, but its two parts (A and B) are highly correlated and may not fully isolate the constructs of interest. More refined tools or additional measures could help separate their individual contributions in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross-sectional nature of the study also prevents any firm conclusions about causality. While network analysis and simulations can suggest which components are likely to be influential, longitudinal or experimental studies are needed to confirm whether changing these factors would actually alter depression risk or symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that future work should aim to validate the tools used to measure cognitive constructs more clearly. In parallel, there is a need for new theoretical models and methods within network psychology that can accommodate diverse types of data, including behavioral, emotional, and biological measures. In the long run, the goal is to develop more personalized interventions by understanding which components in the mental health network are most amenable to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that there are two important steps,” Castro explained. “For the continued study of cognitive processes, we need clarification of task validity to assess specific constructs. From a network perspective, there is a need for new theoretical and methodological developments. The need for large sample sizes and the lack of instruments that are constructed and validated from a network perspective limits our ability to extract clear results from these studies. The emergence of the utilization of passive data in the study of psychological phenomena might be important to overcome these limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.02.106" target="_blank"&gt;The differential impact of processing speed and cognitive flexibility on cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depression&lt;/a&gt;, was authored by Daniel Castro, Pedro Lopes, Ana Sofia Araújo, Filipa Ferreira, Ana Rita Rodrigues, Joana Cardoso, Fernando Ferreira-Santos, and Tiago Bento Ferreira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 16:10:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxQNFZKQUl3djFjNzNLcGxwQXZYa2swM1RqZG9vcWVzZEpNaXhzQ1JGcnU3a0ltTXVnNjZ4YllRckk1bzZIVmtPdGxWNzREYjRiamdDSW90RHFtdGNOdUxZVlBDcHNaM3JwdTdVVks3UkxEM2doYlNYQ3JrOGtrOGIwWEllTzNSTEF3LVZFNzBuQi1MZTlIbUhyeFlmR0FsaTZLSV9Qb0tjNDQ1M0hJV01venpwSFdpTzdzNW80c0lwYUtZTDlJc1VZNGNhQU5uUQ</guid></item><item><title>佐治亚州第五例麻疹病例在早期病例患者的家庭成员中得到确认- 11Alive.com | Fifth measles case in Georgia confirmed in family member of person with earlier case - 11Alive.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxQSlZnOE5NcExJR2gwbTlyZEw2QkdTbXlwSTd4NlVVR21VYWZhMTJqSjNIcDZ2QnRFbFJmQzI3SWwxMVdGQURGby00Smo1V2JPVGo1dC1ja2ppdHQzNUtMNXlmUHNEU014QVBpcU54c1JqMGhkd0o2UjY1TGRNWDR5VmpmNGdIamxtcHNjTVRQcTNZT2pDTzNyM3ZyMGZDZzJaNUxVNloxTTF0bENSem5rdEc0ekllY3RQa1o0ag?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Health officials said Friday that the family member's case was confirmed in May.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — The Georgia Department of Public Health on Friday confirmed a fifth measles case in the state this year. Health officials said the person is the family member of a person with an earlier confirmed case back in May.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original case occurred in an unvaccinated metro Atlanta resident who had acquired the illness outside the country, DPH said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department did not provide any identifying information about the person or their relation to the individual with the earlier case.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Individuals who may have been exposed to either of these persons have been given the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine or antibodies to help reduce the risk of developing measles and are being monitored for symptoms," DPH said in a release Friday. "Currently, no new cases of measles have been reported outside of this family."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to DPH, there were six cases of measles reported in Georgia in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is very contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Measles virus can stay in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room," the DPH said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after contact with the virus. Common symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Then, the DPH said a rash of tiny red spots breaks out, starts at the head, and spreads to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the DPH, MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine can prevent measles and rubella. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends children receive their first dose of MMR vaccine between 12-15 months of age and a second dose between 4-6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DPH said people with symptoms of measles should call their healthcare provider immediately. Health officials advise first calling your doctor's office, hospital, or public health clinic to let them know of any symptoms. Healthcare providers who suspect a patient has measles should then notify the DPH. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

But if testing were adequately improved and scaled up to become more accessible and commonplace, that figure could balloon to 6.1 million.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease should be prioritized for blood work and other screening tests, which will need to skyrocket from about two million to 36 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Follow-up testing also needs to jump by nearly 1,300 percent to meet patient needs, and in more settings than liver clinics, such as family doctors' offices, and with diabetes and heart doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with diabetes are especially prone to liver damage leading to MASH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 30 to 60 percent of diabetics also have MASH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity is another leading risk factor, with estimates suggesting that 75 percent of overweight people and 90 percent with obesity will develop the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with MASH also have a tripled risk of also developing heart disease, including coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure, compared to people without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MASH diagnosis is poised for a major shift, mirroring past breakthroughs in chronic disease management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While about four percent of adults in the US, UK, Germany and France have MASH, fewer than 18 percent are diagnosed. This leaves 16.7 million undiagnosed cases among up to 20 million affected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With new treatments approved and others on the horizon, the focus now turns to fixing systemic roadblocks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, limited access to non-invasive tests and reliance on specialists leave most cases undetected until late stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MASH arises from a cascade of liver damage typically linked to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-10720207/One-four-American-adults-living-potentially-LIFE-THREATENING-liver-disorder.html"&gt;a buildup of fat&lt;/a&gt; in the liver, which triggers inflammation that damages liver cells and activates scar-forming cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What was once healthy liver tissue becomes stiff, progressively crippling the liver's ability to detoxify blood. Though this is often painless until the damage becomes too severe to be reversed.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, people can live normal lifespans with MASH. Lifestyle changes - eating a healthier diet, exercising regularly, and losing between five and 10 percent of one's body weight - can slow down the progression of MASH and repair some of the damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors may prescribe resmetirom, the first FDA-approved medication for MASH, to work hand-in-hand with those lifestyle changes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But severe damage can cause deadly conditions that cut a person's life drastically short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Each late-stage MASH diagnosis represents a missed opportunity for earlier intervention to prevent disease progression, threatening worse [liver] and [non-liver] outcomes for people living with the condition and greater costs for individuals, health systems, and societies,' researchers told a Barcelona medical conference this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If caught early, patients can slow the progression of MASH and even reserve some of the damage by making lifestyle changes and losing weight. Doctors may also prescribe a medication for the condition that works alongside weight loss to reduce severe health issues&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The solution requires concrete changes from moving diagnostics to implementing automated tools in electronic records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said that success in improving diagnostics goes beyond devising better tests. A fundamental reworking of methods of care is needed that catches at-risk patients before irreversible damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Paradigm shifts do not occur in a vacuum, but arise when leaps in science, technology, and innovation are coupled with changes in perception and understanding within a community,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A confluence of factors in 2024 and expected drug approvals in many European countries in 2025 point to a near term tipping point for MASH diagnoses; nonetheless, focused and sustained efforts are needed to turn such opportunities into reality.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 16:00:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在安大略省，未接种疫苗的母亲感染麻疹后，新生儿早产儿死亡- Gizmodo | Premature Newborn Dies in Ontario After Catching Measles From Unvaccinated Mother - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNd3d6dkxyZ0dKV0RIbjJrRXc3UnplUTh6VGJISHFJRXZiS2lCb2trdTRYaUVUcUJxVlNXajB6dHI0bERPN1kyemxsVF9hUlh3YVlVWEZjTmx3MXBpZmNqWTg3TzZyM25VYkx6Qm1Ja29xdEFnSXF3a0dpMnI5N0prTGlPUFhKbm1BRDlqRXpISGw1eG5hQzBjMTlsZFdQcTJRX0lxTGlrQUl4bEVlZlRTdlFR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A premature newborn in Ontario, Canada, has died after contracting measles—the first death this year linked to an ongoing outbreak of the vaccine-preventable disease in the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ontario health officials &lt;a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1006004/statement-from-the-chief-medical-officer-of-health"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the death Thursday. The child caught the viral infection from their mother, who was not vaccinated from measles. Canada, the U.S., and Mexico have all faced surging outbreaks of measles in 2025, fueled by low vaccination rates in certain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is with deep sadness that I confirm that an infant, born prematurely and infected with measles, has tragically passed away in southwestern Ontario,” said Kieran Moore, the chief medical officer of health in Ontario, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ongoing measles outbreaks in North America are believed to have first started in Ontario last fall. By January 2025, measles began to hit parts of Texas, with cases eventually spreading to nearby states and Northern Mexico. The outbreaks have largely occurred in rural Mennonite communities where people often forego routine vaccinations and other healthcare services provided by outside doctors. The U.S. and Mexico have each reported around 1,000 cases of measles this year, while over 2,700 cases have been reported in Canada, mostly in Ontario. But these numbers are almost certainly an underestimate of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Moore, the child contracted measles while in the womb, which may have contributed to their premature birth. The child did have other medical complications unrelated to the virus, however, so it’s possible that the infection may not have been the primary or sole factor behind their death. Measles in general has a very low fatality rate, but it’s highly contagious among unvaccinated people and is known to be more dangerous to developing fetuses and very young children. Over 100,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; from measles globally in 2023, according to the World Health Organization, most of whom were children under the age of five.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though this is Canada’s first death linked to measles this year, it’s not the first in North America. There have been three confirmed measles deaths in the U.S. so far, while more than 100 people (mostly children) have been hospitalized. Unlike the latest death, two of these U.S. deaths &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31898/712-cases-of-measles-reach-nearly-half-of-U-S?autologincheck=redirected#:~:text=Two%20of%20the%20deaths%20were%20unvaccinated%20school%2Dage%20children%20in%20Texas%20who%20had%20no%20underlying%20conditions."&gt;occurred&lt;/a&gt; in children with no pre-existing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles has been resurgent in much of the world as of late, aided by declining vaccination rates. But while this problem has been building up over time, the situation in the U.S. is only &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/millions-of-measles-cases-could-hit-u-s-over-next-25-years-if-vaccination-rates-drop-2000593944"&gt;expected to worsen&lt;/a&gt; under the current presidential administration. Many of President Donald Trump’s appointees—in particular Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—have regularly spread misinformation about the safety of vaccines, including the combination measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. Kennedy has both downplayed the ongoing outbreaks and supported dubious measles treatments with little to no evidence behind them, such as cod liver oil supplements. Many Americans today remain &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-shocking-number-of-americans-are-still-clueless-about-measles-polling-suggests-2000593282"&gt;woefully in the dark&lt;/a&gt; about the severity of these outbreaks and the importance of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Anyone who is unvaccinated is at risk and I urge everyone, but especially those who may become pregnant, to ensure they have received two doses of the MMR vaccine, which will protect both a parent and baby.

			&lt;p&gt;A fitness trend known as Japanese walking is &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJfx77GPJbM/?hl=en"&gt;capturing attention online&lt;/a&gt;, promising major health benefits with minimal equipment and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on interval-style bursts of fast and slow walking, Japanese walking was &lt;a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/walk-hard-walk-easy-repeat/?_r=0"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; by Professor Hiroshi Nose and Associate Professor Shizue Masuki at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves alternating between three minutes of walking at a higher intensity and three minutes at a lower intensity, repeated for at least 30 minutes, four times per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher-intensity walking should be done at a level that is "somewhat hard". At this level, it is still possible to talk, but holding a full conversation would be more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161443" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2.jpg" alt="Older women walking together outdoors." class="wp-image-161443 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2.jpg 2121w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/steps2-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2121px) 100vw, 2121px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161443" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;You might need to stop chatting and pick up the pace. (Ariel Skelley/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower-intensity walking should be done at a level that is "light". At this level, talking should be comfortable, though a little more laboured than an effortless conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking has been likened to high-intensity interval training or Hiit, and has been referred to as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037"&gt;"high-intensity walking"&lt;/a&gt;, although it is less taxing than true Hiit and is performed at lower intensities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also easy to perform and requires only a stopwatch and space for walking. It requires little planning and is less time-consuming than other walking targets, such as achieving 10,000 steps a day. This makes it suitable for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the evidence show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking offers significant health benefits. A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4065/82.7.803"&gt;2007 study&lt;/a&gt; from Japan compared this method to lower-intensity continuous walking, with a goal of achieving 8,000 steps per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who followed the Japanese walking approach experienced notable reductions in body weight. Blood pressure also dropped – more so than in those following the lower-intensity continuous walking routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leg strength and physical fitness were also measured in this study. Both improved to a greater extent in those following the Japanese walking programme, compared to those completing moderate-intensity continuous walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longer-term &lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2018.32.1_supplement.588.9"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; also found that Japanese walking protects against the reductions in strength and fitness that happen with ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These improvements in health would also suggest that Japanese walking can help people live longer, though this has not yet been directly studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few things to consider with this new walking trend. In the 2007 study, around 22% of people did not complete the Japanese walking programme. For the lower intensity programme, with a target of 8,000 steps per day, around 17% did not complete it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that Japanese walking may not be suitable for everyone, and it might not be any easier or more attractive than simple step-based targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving a certain number of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext"&gt;steps per day&lt;/a&gt; has also been shown to help people live longer. For those aged 60 and older, the target should be around 6,000 to 8,000 steps a day and 8,000 to 10,000 for those aged under 60. Similar evidence does not appear to exist for Japanese walking… yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is this walking trend really the be-all and end-all? Or does it matter less about what exercise you do and more about how often and how hard you do it? The answer is likely to be the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003757"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; tells us that people who regularly perform more bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity live longer, regardless of how long each bout is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that we should focus on ensuring we perform regular moderate to vigorous physical activity and make it habitual. If that activity happens to be Japanese walking, then it's a worthwhile choice.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257302/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Now, research points to a simple but powerful strategy that involves meeting a certain quota of weekly activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combing through extensive data, epidemiologist &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo&lt;/a&gt; from the University of California, San Francisco (&lt;a href="https://medicine.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;) and her colleagues noticed that many individuals start off active but lose momentum by middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decline appears to drive up the risk of developing hypertension, a medical condition marked by above-normal blood pressure levels that can result in heart disease and other complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-blood-pressure"&gt;Understanding blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hypertension&lt;/a&gt; affects billions worldwide, placing a significant burden on public health. It develops when the force of blood against the arterial walls remains too high, which can hurt critical organs over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of people live with hypertension without even realizing it, a reason it is often described as a silent condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once discovered, however, moderate to vigorous exercise has proven to be an effective way to reduce those numbers on the blood pressure gauge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-study"&gt;Inside the study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 5,100 adults from four US cities contributed to this one particular study on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/morning-coffee-drinkers-have-a-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers took regular physical measurements and tracked each person’s exercise routines over three decades to see how consistent physical activity influenced blood pressure later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each stage, participants who logged more hours of physical effort ended up with better circulatory readings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who managed five hours of moderate exercise per week saw a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/common-foods-might-work-like-medicines-to-lower-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meaningful reduction&lt;/a&gt; in their chances of having high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-activity-targets-that-matter"&gt;Activity targets that matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Achieving at least twice the current minimum adult guidelines may be more beneficial for the prevention of hypertension than simply meeting the minimum guidelines,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/jason.nagata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/a&gt;, a UCSF expert in young adult medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective supports the evidence that any type of exercise can help manage blood pressure for people without advanced cardiovascular conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate exercise helps the body regulate blood vessels and hormones linked to stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that staying active consistently, rather than pushing hard for a short spurt, can keep the cardiovascular system on a stable path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exercise-helps-blood-pressure"&gt;Exercise helps blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-hour weekly target mentioned in the study isn’t just a random number. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lines up with results from other &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;large-scale reviews&lt;/a&gt; showing that greater amounts of moderate aerobic activity (like brisk walking or biking) can lead to even bigger drops in systolic blood pressure, especially in people at risk but not yet diagnosed with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review by the researchers confirmed this trend across 435 clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings showed that regular exercise lowered &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; by an average of 3.5 mmHg in healthy adults and by 5.5 mmHg in those with lifestyle-related diseases, including hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers matter because even small reductions can significantly lower the risk of stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-social-and-racial-differences"&gt;Social and racial differences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that race and social backgrounds heavily influence a person’s ability to stay &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;physically active&lt;/a&gt;. At 40 years old, physical activity dipped among White men and women, yet Black men and women saw a continued decline rather than a plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 45, Black women in the study surpassed White men in the number of hypertension cases. At 60, upwards of 80 to 90 percent of Black participants were living with high blood pressure, compared to around 70 percent of White men and about half of White women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people face hidden obstacles that make it difficult to stay active over the years. Work shifts, unsafe neighborhoods, lack of access to parks, and limited time all contribute to the decline in physical &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/caffeine-at-night-disrupts-sleep-and-brain-activity-especially-in-young-adults/"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt;, especially in underserved communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although Black male youth may have high engagement in sports, socioeconomic factors, neighborhood environments, and work or family responsibilities may prevent continued engagement in physical activity through adulthood,” said Nagata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that socioeconomic factors and environment weren’t directly measured in this study, but they likely played a major role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-consistent-fitness-habits"&gt;Consistent fitness habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Teenagers and those in their early 20s may be physically active but these patterns change with age,” explained Bibbins-Domingo. In earlier years, many teenagers and people in their early 20s get daily movement through sports and outdoor activities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This might be especially the case after high school when opportunities for physical &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; diminish,” said Nagata. At some point, life’s responsibilities can interfere with exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health advocates often focus on educating children and adolescents about adopting active lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in this study highlight how those messages remain vital for maintaining heart health as people transition to jobs, parenthood, and hectic schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-pressure-exercise-and-heart-health"&gt;Blood pressure, exercise, and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week for adults, though this research suggests going beyond that threshold offers clear advantages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding structured workouts or simple movement like brisk walks can be powerful steps in lowering long-term risk of high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a committed exercise routine takes extra planning as the years go by.

Bush administration. These strategies were designed by the security council and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the Department of Health and Human Services, among other agencies. The plans rely on rolling out vaccines rapidly in a pandemic. Moving fast hinges on producing vaccines domestically, ensuring their safety and getting them into arms across the nation through the public health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Trump administration is undermining each of these steps as it guts health agencies, cuts research and health budgets and issues perplexing policy changes, health security experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since President Donald Trump took office, at least half of the security council's staff have been laid off or left, and the future of BARDA is murky.

"When the need hits and we aren't ready, no other country will come to our rescue and we will suffer greatly," said Rick Bright, an immunologist and a former BARDA director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Countries that produced their own vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic had &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02383-z" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;first dibs&lt;/a&gt; on the shots. While the United States, home to Moderna and Pfizer, rolled out second doses of mRNA vaccines in 2021, hundreds of thousands of people in countries that didn't manufacture vaccines died waiting for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The most pertinent pandemic threat today is the bird flu virus H5N1. Researchers around the world &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-ground-zero-texas-dairy-farms-whodunit-h5n1/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;were alarmed&lt;/a&gt; when it began spreading among cattle in the U.S. last year. Cows are closer to humans biologically than birds, indicating that the virus had evolved to thrive in cells like our own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As hundreds of herds and dozens of people were infected in the U.S., the Biden administration funded Moderna to develop bird flu vaccines using mRNA technology. As part of the agreement, the U.S. government stipulated it could purchase doses in advance of a pandemic. That no longer stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers can make bird flu vaccines in other ways, but mRNA vaccines are developed much more quickly because they don't rely on finicky biological processes, such as growing elements of vaccines in chicken eggs or cells kept alive in laboratory tanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Time matters because flu viruses mutate constantly, and vaccines work better when they match whatever variant is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Developing vaccines within eggs or cells can take 10 months after the genetic sequence of a variant is known, Bright said. And relying on eggs presents an additional risk when it comes to bird flu because a pandemic could wipe out billions of chickens, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-potential-pandemic-vaccine-chicken-egg-quandary/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;crashing egg supplies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Decades-old methods that rely on inactivated flu viruses are riskier for researchers and time-consuming. Still the Trump administration &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;invested $500 million&lt;/a&gt; into this approach, which was largely abandoned by the 1980s after it caused seizures in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This politicized regression is baffling," Bright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A bird flu pandemic may begin quietly in the U.S. if the virus evolves to spread between people but &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-trump-immigration-raids-farmworkers-threats-california-michigan/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;no one is tested&lt;/a&gt; at first. Indeed, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's dashboard suggests that only 10 farmworkers have been tested for the bird flu since March. Because of their close contact with cattle and poultry, farmworkers are at highest risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As with many diseases, only a fraction of people with the bird flu become severely sick. So the first sign that the virus is widespread might be a surge in hospital cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We'd need to immediately make vaccines," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 (L) and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines fill their syringes at Borinquen Health Care Center on May 29, 2025 in Miami, Florida.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The U.S. government could scale up production of &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bird-flu-vaccines-finland-farmworkers-veterinarians-us-stockpile/" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;existing bird flu vaccines&lt;/a&gt; developed in eggs or cells. However, these vaccines target an older strain of H5N1 and their efficacy against the virus circulating now is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In addition to the months it takes to develop an updated version within eggs or cells, Rasmussen questioned the ability of the government to rapidly test and license updated shots, with a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/28/us/politics/trump-doge-federal-job-cuts.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;quarter of HHS staff gone&lt;/a&gt;. If the Senate approves Trump's proposed budget, the agency faces about $32 billion in cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Further, the Trump administration's cuts to biomedical research and its push to slash grant money for overhead costs could undermine academic hospitals, rendering them unable to conduct large clinical trials. And its cuts to the CDC and to public health funds to states mean that fewer health officials will be available in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"You can't just turn this all back on," Rasmussen said. "The longer it takes to respond, the more people die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Researchers suggest other countries would produce bird flu vaccines first. "The U.S. may be on the receiving end like India was, where everyone -- rich people, too -- got vaccines late," said Achal Prabhala, a public health researcher in India at medicines access group AccessIBSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He sits on the board of a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://medicinespatentpool.org/what-we-do/mrna-technology-transfer-programme" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;World Health Organization initiative&lt;/a&gt; to improve access to mRNA vaccines in the next pandemic. A member of the initiative, the company Sinergium Biotech in Argentina, is testing an mRNA vaccine against the bird flu. If it works, Sinergium will share the intellectual property behind the vaccine with about a dozen other groups in the program from middle-income countries so they can produce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international partnership headquartered in Norway, is providing funds to research groups developing rapid-response vaccine technology, including mRNA, in South Korea, Singapore and France. And CEPI committed up to $20 million to efforts to prepare for a bird flu pandemic. This year, the Indian government issued a call for grant applications to develop mRNA vaccines for the bird flu, warning it "poses a grave public health risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Pharmaceutical companies are investing in mRNA vaccines for the bird flu as well. However, Prabhala says private capital isn't sufficient to bring early-stage vaccines through clinical trials and large-scale manufacturing. That's because there's no market for bird flu vaccines until a pandemic hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Limited supplies means the United States would have to wait in line for mRNA vaccines made abroad.

By comparing identical twins where only one has MS, researchers reduced confounding genetic and environmental factors and pinpointed 51 bacterial taxa with different abundances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model, they found that gut bacteria from MS-affected twins could trigger MS-like symptoms, implicating Lachnoclostridium sp. and Eisenbergiella tayi as potential disease-causing microbes. These findings open a path to targeted gut-based therapies and emphasize the role of microbiome and lifestyle in MS development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MS-Discordant Twins Used:&lt;/strong&gt; Identical twins helped isolate microbial factors by minimizing genetic and lifestyle variation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Evidence in Mice:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice colonized with gut bacteria from MS patients developed MS-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Microbes Implicated:&lt;/strong&gt; Lachnoclostridium sp. and Eisenbergiella tayi emerged as potential MS triggers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than 280,000 people in Germany have multiple sclerosis (MS) and approximately 15,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes MS the most common inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. In MS, the body’s own immune cells attack the insulating layer surrounding nerve fibers, damaging their function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where attacks occur, a wide variety of symptoms can arise, which is why MS is also known as the disease of a thousand faces. Impaired vision, other sensory disturbances, and paralysis are just some of the symptoms that people living with MS must contend with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how MS causes immune cells to become dysfunctional is still largely unclear. MS is a multifactorial disease—there is no single trigger, but rather several factors must come together for the disease to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to genetic components, various environmental factors such as smoking, vitamin D deficiency, certain infectious diseases, and especially microorganisms in the gut have all been linked to the development of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have identified numerous bacterial strains that distinguish the intestinal flora of MS patients from that of healthy individuals. However, the significance of these differences for the course of the disease remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it was often difficult to interpret the results, as genetic differences or differing eating habits among the test subjects can have a major influence on the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Twin study reduces confounding factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To minimize these confounding factors, a team from several research institutions launched a major collaborative project—with the help of twins. Although identical twins share nearly the same genetic makeup, in some MS cases one twin may develop the disease while the other remains symptom-free—known as an MS-discordant pair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 100 such twin pairs are currently taking part in the MS TWIN STUDY at the Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology at the University Hospital of the LMU Munich, enabling the disease to be studied under more comparable conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to their minimal genetic differences, the twins lived together until early adulthood, meaning they were exposed to many of the same environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Comparing the gut flora&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined stool samples from 81 pairs of twins enrolled in the MS TWIN STUDY, and compared their composition between siblings. They identified 51 taxa—groups of microorganisms—that differed in abundance between twins with and without MS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the researchers went one step further in this study: Four of the twin pairs also agreed to have samples taken from their small intestines using enteroscopy. The disease-causing interactions between microorganisms and the body’s own immune cells are believed to occur there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most previous studies have relied exclusively on stool samples, which provide only limited information about the microorganisms in the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test whether the samples from the small intestine contain disease-causing organisms, the researchers used special transgenic mice. These live a healthy life under germ-free conditions, however after colonization with gut bacteria, they can develop a MS-like disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, the mice were given samples from a twin with or without MS in parallel. Symptoms were mainly observed in mice that had been colonized with MS samples, indicating the presence of disease-causing microorganisms in the small intestines of people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then examined the feces of the diseased mice and identified two members of the family of Lachnospiraceae (&lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium sp&lt;/em&gt;. and &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt;) as potential disease-causing factors. Due to their low abundance in the intestine, these bacteria had previously only been associated with MS in large and well-controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with their innovative experimental strategy, the researchers were able for the first time to functionally characterize these bacteria and provide evidence for their pathogenicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists emphasize that there may be other microorganisms with the potential to trigger MS. Further studies are needed to obtain a more comprehensive picture and to examine the pathogenicity of the two candidates identified so far in detail—initially in a mouse model of the disease and later also regarding the transferability of the results to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if it turns out that only a small number of microorganisms trigger the disease, this could open up new therapeutic options. Strikingly, the study demonstrates the role that lifestyle habits play in the development of MS and provides new experimental strategies to further investigate their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this multiple sclerosis research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9cac1dbc0daddc0c7c887cbc0ccc5c4ccc0ccdbe9cbc087c4d9ce87cdcc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christine Bielmeier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mpg.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Christine Bielmeier – Max Planck Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2419689122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Multiple sclerosis and gut microbiota: Lachnospiraceae from the ileum of MS twins trigger MS-like disease in germfree transgenic mice—An unbiased functional study&lt;/a&gt;” by Hartmut Wekerle et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple sclerosis and gut microbiota: Lachnospiraceae from the ileum of MS twins trigger MS-like disease in germfree transgenic mice—An unbiased functional study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed a two-tiered strategy aiming to identify gut bacteria functionally linked to the development of multiple sclerosis (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we compared gut microbial profiles in a cohort of 81 monozygotic twins discordant for MS. This approach allowed to minimize confounding effects by genetic and early environmental factors and identified over 50 differently abundant taxa with the majority of increased taxa within the &lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included taxa previously described to be associated with MS (&lt;em&gt;Anaerotruncus colihominis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt;), along with newly identified taxa, such as &lt;em&gt;Copromonas&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Acutalibacter&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we interrogated the intestinal habitat and functional impact of individual taxa on the development of MS-like disease. In an exploratory approach, we enteroscopically sampled microbiota from different gut segments of selected twin pairs and compared their compositional profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess their functional potential, samples were orally transferred into germfree transgenic mice prone to develop spontaneous MS-like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) upon bacterial colonization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that MS-derived ileal microbiota induced EAE at substantially higher rates than analogous material from healthy twin donors. Furthermore, female mice were more susceptible to disease development than males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The likely active organisms were identified as &lt;em&gt;Eisenbergiella tayi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lachnoclostridium,&lt;/em&gt; members of the Lachnospiraceae family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results identify potentially disease-facilitating bacteria sampled from the ileum of MS affected twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental strategy may pave the way to functionally understand the role of gut microbiota in initiation of MS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 13:35:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYEFVX3lxTE02Nl93SVpuVV9qdUpRYXV5OFVpeE16TnhNMkZfXzgtTVVUMno0NHZIcUk1N1F2Yk93ZG1PV0xJeUtVUWNydTkyYUdiVVNtd2NSaFhvZXJHYV9nRmxjQnZyUQ</guid></item><item><title>怀孕期间未摄入足够的某些食物可能会增加婴儿成为双性人的机会-每日邮报 | Not eating enough of certain food during pregnancy may raise chance of baby being intersex - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPWWctbWFpeTBEVG4wYkFFNnFjek1qSGZkelRHNTRsSnl4OGRrZGdxZFJBMkRHNW9kTGlHX1JtaWg3dTFtbUJOM0NYbUt5YmtITGxocFR3SHo1bFZxYXNlc3hrYkpFZWZPY01wT3hUN2FYa3hhS0pWUE1GS05VVUpjM2JzUVFpYmVaNXpDbXNzWjJfdWZmNTQ1Mm5UNmN2V0lBYWVKMzVuYUQ2d9IBrwFBVV95cUxPRzZfVFR6V2pabDZHQXVhTnpLalVhR01RTVpDMFNhV3hvb3NXbWQtVVdVOUZfUlREcDNoNHlydDBMT2RLdDJKeG5OZXV2bWtvRkJMdEl6WDcyNWd6Z29uUGJrRzlFNWExTk15WXBYamdLYlRDM1Q4Q1BpdUJYY2dsdlNaMDdLRUIweGZJVzVBNU1pRzR5RndTeVNWdUt2SWNBekVLakdfTDBiTWR3aDVZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not getting enough iron during pregnancy could raise the risk of babies being born intersex, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found for the first time that pregnant mice deficient in the mineral are more likely to give birth to males who have female genitalia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14779805/pregnancy-woman-drinking-alcohol.html"&gt;This deficiency during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; is most often caused by a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14715491/Tired-time-nutritional-deficiency-warn-experts.html"&gt; lack of iron in the diet&lt;/a&gt;, which can naturally come from eating iron-rich foods like red meat, red kidney beans, edamame beans, chickpeas, nuts and leafy green vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A simple blood test can determine a woman's iron levels and if she is deficient, a supplement can be prescribed.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intersex is a condition in which individuals have genitals or reproductive organs that do not fit the typical binary definitions of male or female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who are intersex may also have chromosomes that differ from the typical male and female binary. Their genitals may not match their reproductive organs or they may have traits of both. This can include variations in e&lt;span&gt;xternal or internal reproductive organs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mammals, biological sex is determined by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome — females typically have XX chromosomes whereas males typically have XY ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, a primary gene is responsible for formation of the corresponding sexual organs, such as testicles and penis or ovaries and vagina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mice, for instance, with XY chromosomes usually develop testes if a gene called 'Sry' (Sex-determining Region Y gene) is activated and ovaries if it is not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers behind this latest study had previously shown that Sry is activated by an enzyme called 'histone demethylase,' which needs iron to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In their new lab tests, they looked at how iron levels would therefore impact the development of sexual&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14732945/fertility-female-experts-improve-birth-rate-decline.html"&gt; organs in unborn babies. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one of their trials, the researchers gave mice with low levels of histone demethylase an iron-deficient diet for a month before pregnancy and for two weeks during pregnancy, and compared them with mice that were fed a control diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells were lower among iron-deficient mice than in the control-diet mice, as expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But two of the 43 male babies carried by iron-deficient mothers also developed female-typical sex organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All the control mice grew sex organs typical of their chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other tests, which dug into the impact of iron further, revealed similar results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Iron deficiency during pregnancy is most often caused by a lack of iron in the diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one study, four mice with XY (typical male) chromosomes were born with two ovaries and one with one ovary and one testis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It could be posited that when iron levels are low, the enzyme 'histone demethylase' may not activate the Sry gene, which is responsible for the development of male sex organs and reproductive organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, mice with XY chromosomes may develop female - or both types of - organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emerging evidence suggests maternal diet and exposure to environmental toxins can affect gene activity involved in the early development of testes and ovaries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The latest findings could have implications for medical advice about iron intake during pregnancy, Harley adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A separate study investigating the link between iron and organ development found b&lt;/span&gt;abies born to mothers with low iron levels are far more likely to suffer heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists now posit anemia - low levels of red blood cells due to low iron levels - in pregnant women may be to blame for about one in 20 congenital heart disease (CHD) cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The deadly condition is one of the most common types of birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, by the British Heart Foundation, analyzed the data of 16,500 mothers and found the chances of having a child with CHD was 47 percent greater in women with low iron levels in their first 100 days of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts will now investigate whether taking iron supplements before and during pregnancy could help prevent heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cheap over-the-counter supplement could hold the key to preventing heart failure in people with Type 2 diabetes, according to research presented Tuesday at the &lt;a href="https://britishcardiovascularsociety.org.uk/annual-conference/" target="_blank"&gt;British Cardiovascular Society conference&lt;/a&gt; in Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study found that diabetes patients who took daily mitoquinone, a widely available antioxidant, as well as their standard treatment had healthier hearts after four months than those not given the supplement. Mitoquinone was able to reverse the early signs of diabetes-related heart failure over the course of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Henry Procter, clinical research fellow at the University of Leeds and lead author of the study, said, "These encouraging results are a sign that mitoquinone could keep hearts healthier for longer in people with diabetes. If the study had continued for longer, it is likely we would have started to see differences in more serious indicators of heart health between the group with mitoquinone and the group without."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope that a larger study will continue to demonstrate the benefits of this antioxidant, and that one day soon diabetic patients can be prescribed it to help prevent heart failure before it ever affects their lives."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's estimated that more than 5.8 million people in the U.K. have diabetes, an all-time high, with around 90% having Type 2. This number is predicted to continue to rise, and Type 2 diabetes patients are up to five times more likely to develop heart failure than the rest of the population. Once a patient with diabetes is diagnosed with heart failure, they are three times more likely to die over the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes causes problems with how the body, including the heart, processes and uses energy—its metabolism. This can cause stress and damage to the cells of the heart muscle, which over time can lead to the heart stiffening and being unable to pump blood well, eventually to the point of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Mitoquinone is an antioxidant supplement that is thought to guard cells against this metabolic stress and damage. It is often sold online to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/amateur+athletes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;amateur athletes&lt;/a&gt; and others as manufacturers claim it can improve cellular energy levels and support healthy aging. However, until now there has been very little clinical data on its effectiveness at protecting diabetic patients' hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that after four months of mitoquinone, diabetic patients' hearts were able to process and use energy 15% more efficiently when at rest than they had been. Improvements were also seen during exercise. As well as this, the heart muscles of the mitoquinone group were able to relax more quickly. These were all signs that the early indicators of stress and stiffness in this group's hearts had been reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team recruited 70 people with Type 2 diabetes from across Leeds. People who already had a heart condition were not included in the study. Tests and heart scans were done before and after a four-month period where half of the participants took daily 40 mg mitoquinone tablets as well as their normal diabetes treatments, and the other half just had their normal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mitoquinone group saw a reversal in early signs of metabolic stress. The standard treatment group did not see the same changes. After the four months, none of the patients in the study had developed dangerous heart symptoms or seen changes in their diabetes control. There were no major side effects to taking mitoquinone.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;The team are now looking into running a larger trial of mitoquinone in diabetes patients, to gather more evidence that the supplement could protect hearts and prevent &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+failure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; over time. If the results of further studies are positive, they hope that diabetes patients could one day be prescribed mitoquinone to keep their hearts healthier for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bryan Willians, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said, "This study presents some intriguing initial findings. It's still early days for this research and the results will need to be confirmed in a larger scale trial. The study neatly demonstrates why it is so important to continue to support research and look for solutions in a wide variety of places, so that we can continue to offer hope to people living with, and at risk of, cardiovascular disease."&lt;/p&gt;

Kanisha Collins, 24, began suffering from liver pain and recurring water infections last winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_commercial__Wo6Z4" data-testid="commercial-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;She underwent treatment for pancreatitis at Chesterfield Royal Hospital, where doctors detected a mass on her pancreas along with blood clots. A CT scan in February even hinted at a reduction in the size of the mass, with medics suggesting it was likely gallstones, particularly given her youth – no further probing deemed necessary at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;But the situation took a dire turn when Kanisha visited A&amp;amp;E this April due to escalating pain, leading to the discovery of liver lesions. Subsequent biopsy results delivered the devastating news: she had stage four pancreatic cancer, which had spread to her liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;The 24 year old has embarked on chemotherapy in the hope of decelerating the disease. Kanisha and her partner Mason Furnace, 29, are rushing to tie the knot this Saturday, with their two-year-old daughter Amaya playing the role of flower girl at their nuptials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="recommended-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;From her home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the care assistant said: "We've been engaged for two years, but when they found the mass my fiancé wanted to get married this year to speed things up. It's stressful, I'm having chemo so obviously I'm going to be tired on my wedding day – not how I wanted to feel on my wedding day. But I'm still going to be thoroughly looking forward to it because it's a day with friends and family and a day to celebrate me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Kanisha initially consulted her doctor in December 2024, complaining of pain, appetite issues, and indigestion. Although a mass was detected on her pancreas, it was not tested, with doctors attributing her symptoms to gallstones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="BoxStyles_box-container__Qk3WH BoxStyles_non-commercial__aiWwo" data-testid="non-commercial-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Kanisha said: "They misdiagnosed me because of my age, saying they didn't think anyone my age would have that kind of cancer. They never attempted to test the mass they found back in December."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Doctors continued to monitor the mass, noting a slight reduction in size by February 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX false" data-testid="imageembed-35349714"&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure_figure__Uce4f"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35349714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_bride-to-bes-in-1382282.jpg" alt="Kanisha with her daughter Amaya" loading="lazy" srcset="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35349714.ece/ALTERNATES/s458b/0_bride-to-bes-in-1382282.jpg 458w, https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35349714.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_bride-to-bes-in-1382282.jpg 615w,

And now I'm left with something incurable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;It wasn't until April, when Kanisha visited A&amp;amp;E with lower stomach pain, that a CT scan revealed the devastating truth: she had pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Reflecting on her experience, Kanisha said: "When it came back that it all stemmed from my pancreas, it was heartbreaking for me, because I'm 24 and I just feel like the hospital could have done more and pushed for more tests in the beginning. Then I might not have been in the situation I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;"People should get tested sooner for anything they find mass-wise, in any age of person, because nobody should go through it. The problem with pancreatic cancer is that there are not that many symptoms. But your appetite lessens and you get a lot more indigestion and stuff because it's to do with your digestive system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Kanisha and her daughter Amaya are living in Chesterfield with Kanisha's father Dean Collins, who set up a GoFundMe to support photo sessions, keepsakes and memory-making days out between the mother and her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;The heartbroken mum said: "My daughter is only the age of two so she's not understanding anything at the moment. Obviously it's putting a lot of strain on the family and financially of course. Everyone's trying to support me and my daughter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Dean, a train driver, expressed his grief on the fundraising site: "Despite being so young, her life is being cruelly cut short.

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of scientific investigations have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="164012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may not be merely a condition of an aging brain, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;but the product of infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly spread&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" wf_caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains&lt;/em&gt; (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's. (Cortexyme)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infectious agents have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease before, but the evidence of causation hasn't been convincing," &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324298"&gt;Dominy said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, and Alzheimer's pathogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team identified toxic enzymes called gingipains secreted by the bacteria in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein, and a protein tag called ubiquitin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's important, because while &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known – to put it simply – whether gum disease causes Alzheimers, or whether dementia leads to poor oral care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg" alt="dentist checking x rays" class="wp-image-152675 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Does gum disease cause Alzheimer's, or could those with dementia be at greater risk of poor dental hygiene?

The implant, woven into a lattice of light-sensitive nanowires, converts both visible and near-infrared light into electrical signals for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In blind mice, it restored visual reflexes and behavioral vision, while in macaques, it enhanced detection of wavelengths beyond natural sight. This breakthrough marks a major step toward restoring vision in the blind and augmenting human vision beyond current biological limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision Restored in Mice:&lt;/strong&gt; The nanowire prosthesis restored pupil reflexes and visual cortex activity in blind mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrared Vision in Macaques:&lt;/strong&gt; Sighted primates with the implant gained sensitivity to near-infrared light.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe and Biocompatible:&lt;/strong&gt; The implant showed no adverse effects in blind macaques, supporting long-term clinical promise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new prosthesis for the retina weaved with nanowires partially restored vision in blind mice and allowed detection of near-infrared light in macaques, according to a new study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new technology’s feasibility and strong safety profile marks a milestone in the development of artificial vision, which could prove invaluable to patients worldwide who are living with blindness or retinal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are many approaches to restoring vision in the blind, but almost all of these treatments face obstacles such as electrical interference or a lack of long-term efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110713"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/visual-implant-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Using imaging and electrophysiological recording, the team found that implanting the prosthesis into genetically blind mice restored reflexes in the pupil and evoked neuron firing in the visual cortex. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, researchers are also trying to augment the human eye’s capabilities to detect other wavelengths of light, including near-infrared. Such a technology could be a boon to vision restoration efforts, as detecting near-infrared light would provide better color contrast and could be helpful in dark conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To kill two birds with one stone, Shuiyuan Wang and colleagues designed a nanoprosthesis for the retina based on tellurium, a silver-white, light-sensitive element that’s used as a semiconductor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers constructed tellurium nanowires and interlaced them into a lattice network, creating an architecture that can easily be implanted and efficiently converts both visible and near-infrared light into electrical signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using imaging and electrophysiological recording, the team found that implanting the prosthesis into genetically blind mice restored reflexes in the pupil and evoked neuron firing in the visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blind mice with the implants also performed better on pattern recognition tests and could find LED lights during a behavioral test, and eventually almost matched the performance of normal mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nanoprosthesis was safe and biocompatible when implanted into a blind crab-eating macaque, and augmented the eye’s sensitivity to near-infrared light in a sighted macaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term success of these technologies depends on developing cost-effective solutions and ensuring their availability to a broader range of patients,” cautions Eduardo Fernández in a related Perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#daa9b9b3aabbb19abbbbbba9f4b5a8bd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Press Package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aaas.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Science Press Package – AAAS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adu2987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tellirium nanowire retinal nanoprosthesis improves vision in models of blindness&lt;/a&gt;” by Shuiyuan Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tellirium nanowire retinal nanoprosthesis improves vision in models of blindness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In nature, there are animals, such as snakes, that assess their environment more accurately by sensing both infrared radiation and the visible-light spectrum. The human eye lacks photoreceptors responsive to the infrared spectrum, and infrared light with a longer wavelength and lower energy cannot trigger visual signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In patients with severe eye diseases (e.g., macular degeneration), infrared vision could, in principle, aid vision in low light and darkness. Developing technologies that use a wider spectrum of light, including infrared, could provide notable benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Present designs for broad-spectrum retinal protheses use nanoparticles or photodiodes to convert infrared into visible light or heat to stimulate retinal cells. Because they require injections or bulky auxiliary devices, there are safety and practicality issues for potential application to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creation of a safe, easy-to-implant retinal prosthesis that enables the processing of both visible and infrared light may restore vision loss and enhance natural vision. We designed a next-generation retinal nanoprosthesis based on tellurium nanowire networks that intrinsically converts broadband light—including visible to infrared light—with efficient photovoltaic conversion, yielding giant with photocurrents under zero-electric bias and without the need for extra auxiliary equipment. We then achieved safe and simple implantation in the subretinal space of mice and &lt;em&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through theoretical calculations, we show spontaneous giant and wide-spectrum photocurrents of tellurium nanowire networks to be correlated with the asymmetry of nanowire lattice internal defects and external interfacial effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of narrow bandgaps, strong absorption, and engineered asymmetries, tellurium optoelectronic nanodevices showed record-high photocurrents and the widest spectrum of responsive photosensitivity wavelengths compared with reported techniques for the restoration of photosensitivity in blindness, covering the visible to near-infrared–II range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preimplantation tests confirmed the stability of the nanoprosthesis’s optoelectronic properties and its precise response to light patterns. In blind mice, the implanted nanoprosthesis replaced damaged photoreceptors and triggered responses in both the optic nerve and visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implanted mice showed better light-induced pupil reactions and improvement in light-associated learning behaviors (such as water reward–based visual-cue associative learning and choice-box tasks) when compared with untreated mice and when using light intensities nearly 80 times weaker than the clinical safety threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biocompatibility and efficacy of the proposed nanoprosthesis was further demonstrated in nonhuman primates (&lt;em&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/em&gt;), where the nanoprosthesis was tightly bound to the retina in the subretinal space and generated robust retina-derived responses to visible and infrared light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study provides biologically feasible parameters for a retinal prosthesis using designed tellurium nanowire networks. These nanowires naturally convert light into photocurrent signals with zero electrical bias and can cover the visible to infrared spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tested nanoprosthesis generates strong photocurrents to activate the remaining retinal circuitry in a dysfunctional eye, works through a simple subretinal implantation procedure, and avoids bulky intra- and extraocular components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In blind mice, this retinal nanoprosthesis restored the brain’s response to light and improved vision-based behaviors at clinically safe light levels. Nonhuman primates implanted with this nanoprosthesis gained infrared vision without impairment of normal vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This successful animal study paves the way for future human trials, showcasing the potential of this prosthesis to restore visible vision and expand augmented infrared perception for blind humans and offer a safer, more effective, and wider-spectrum solution than existing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 12:55:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1PVmJJZHdJZlhuWkZ1TXd6M0R3bVE5amxNWHhKemloNW5YaEpzLS1ZbzlhNlJCM0FyQ2kzVHdXUnEwcURvMmZEbURoY2w5REJlTkRPVnBFWG1FUzBaZWtIYThtakJsZW5BVTNF</guid></item></channel></rss>
