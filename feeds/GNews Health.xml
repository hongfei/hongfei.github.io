When eggs donated by fertility patients were given microinjections of the protein, they were almost half as likely to show the defect compared with untreated eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If confirmed in more extensive trials, the approach has the potential to improve egg quality, which is the primary cause of IVF failure and miscarriage in older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Overall we can nearly halve the number of eggs with [abnormal] chromosomes. That’s a very prominent improvement,” said Prof Melina Schuh, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences in Göttingen and a co-founder of Ovo Labs, which is aiming to commercialise the technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Most women in their early 40s do have eggs, but nearly all of the eggs have incorrect chromosome numbers,” added Schuh, whose lab has been investigating egg biology for the past two decades. “This was the motivation for wanting to address this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The findings will be presented at the &lt;a href="https://www.fertilityconference.org/event/1ee53df6-56c5-4634-a9d6-30bbe6c9deec/home" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;British Fertility Conference in Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; on Friday and have been published as a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.08.698387v1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;preprint paper on the Biorxiv website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The decline in egg quality is the main reason IVF success rates drop steeply with female age and is why the risk of chromosome disorders such as Down’s syndrome increases with maternal age. For patients under 35, the average birthrate for each embryo transferred in IVF treatment was 35%, compared with just 5% for women aged 43-44, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.hfea.gov.uk/about-us/publications/research-and-data/fertility-treatment-2023-trends-and-figures/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most recent UK figures&lt;/a&gt;. The average age of fertility patients starting treatment for the first time in the UK is now over 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Agata Zielinska, a co-founder and co-CEO of Ovo Labs, said: “Currently, when it comes to female factor infertility, the only solution that’s available to most patients is trying IVF multiple times so that, cumulatively, your likelihood of success increases. What we envision is that many more women would be able to conceive within a single IVF cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The latest approach targets a vulnerability in eggs linked to a process called meiosis, in which sex cells (eggs or sperm) jettison half their genetic material so they can join together to make an embryo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In eggs, this requires 23 pairs of X-shaped chromosomes to align along a single axis in the cell. On fertilisation, the cell divides causing the chromosome pairs to be – ideally – neatly snapped down their centres to create a cell with precisely 23 single chromosomes from the mother, the rest being delivered by the sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, in older eggs the chromosome pairs tend to loosen at their midpoint, becoming slightly unstuck or detaching entirely before fertilisation. In this scenario, the X-shaped structures fail to line up properly and move around chaotically in the cell, so when the cell divides they are not snapped symmetrically. This results in an embryo with too many or too few chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Schuh and colleagues previously found that a protein, Shugoshin 1, which appears to act as a glue for the chromosome pairs, declines with age. In the latest experiments in mouse and human eggs, they found that microinjections of Shugoshin 1 appeared to reverse the problem of chromosome pairs separating prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Using eggs donated by patients at the Bourn Hall fertility clinic in Cambridge, they found that the number showing the defect decreased from 53% in control eggs to 29% in treated eggs. When they looked only at eggs from women over 35 years of age, a similar trend was seen (65% compared with 44%), although this result was not statistically significant, which the scientists said was probably due to them only having treated nine eggs in this age range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What is really beautiful is that we identified a single protein that, with age, goes down, returned it to young levels and it has a big effect,” Schuh said. “We are just restoring the younger situation again with this approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The approach would not extend fertility beyond menopause, when the egg reserve runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aside from intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), there are not currently any treatments involving microinjections into eggs, but the team does not anticipate safety issues and are in discussions with regulators about a clinical trial. An important question will be whether the apparent improvements in egg quality results in embryos with fewer genetic errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Güneş Taylor, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the research, described the findings as “really promising”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is really important work because we need approaches that work for older eggs because that’s the point at which most women appear,” she said. “If there’s a one-shot injection that substantially increases the number of eggs with properly organised chromosomes, that gives you a better starting point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jan 2026 16:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQdTA2SEdWU3NfV2NDc21mS1lqUW5OaER4QzY3dUJnRHFjdjVxQXdsbXFpbnZEbHotQ2FpWjAtNlZ0dkxxMjJfQnFFc2dvZWZJYlMzNW9yRTdIR1k3bTBpNUJFZEp4aDAzWDMzZ1BxdUFlM1F4YWVwc2EwWENrTWhZd1ZtV2ZyMWFJUWsxcG1fUnl6NkZmU2hnYW1EeUdIOTh1MklUTklnNUctcl9fQTQ2YXcxTElLYUk</guid></item><item><title>尊敬的Annie ：肿瘤学家告诉我，我是“幸存者” ，但我不觉得自己是“幸存者” - NJ.com</title><link>https://www.nj.com/advice/2026/01/dear-annie-oncologists-tell-me-im-a-survivor-but-i-dont-feel-like-a-survivor.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KWC4BU7SJNCJLKPO75DZQV7ZMY"&gt;DEAR ANNIE: I was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago. I’ve been through surgery and radiation treatments. According to the oncologists, I should now consider myself a “survivor.” Since I have scars, I’m taking medication for the next 10 years that has potentially really bad side effects, and the chance of reoccurrence is a definite possibility, I don’t feel like a “survivor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HOESMRSVMFG5ZC2LOUMOI2RTHA"&gt;I readily admit that I’m depressed. I maintain that this is a perfectly reasonable reaction to something bad that has upended and changed my whole life for the foreseeable future. I’m not suicidal, and although some mornings are hard, I get up every day, shower, brush my hair and teeth and maintain my usual schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FF26BAMBO5DINFIHNXYLVOVGP4"&gt;The worst thing to me about cancer is that I can’t talk to anyone because I’ve gone from an actual person with thoughts and interests to people only wanting to know about the cancer. It’s all anyone asks about. That being the case, I tried to talk to people about how I feel, but the word “depressed” freaks people out more than “cancer.” Now I just say I’m fine or OK to make others feel comfortable, which applies to my doctors as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XIYAEA7KDVENPHBBP7UWUY5SJ4"&gt;I don’t need medication, and I tried online and in-person group discussions a few times, and they aren’t for me. I’ve noticed the same thing with people who lose a loved one or have something else bad happen -- they aren’t allowed to be depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7YJRC56AINEV7OAKKAREX3R7ZI"&gt;When did it become shameful and something that needs to be fixed when people have a true human emotion to events? Sad things should understandably make us sad -- and maybe depressed? Please note, I’m not talking about people with real diagnosed clinical depression or other mental issues. -- Sad “Survivor”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CGYCUX75JRBLBH6NP33WQV36MU"&gt;DEAR SAD “SURVIVOR”: The word “survivor” may sound triumphant, yes, but it doesn’t cancel out the fear, pain and lifelong change you’ve endured to get here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="733I5T7VYFH3ZOQ4ATJNAC2EDE"&gt;It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a victory to be where you are today, and there’s nothing troubling about feeling conflicted. What is troubling is feeling you have to hide it -- especially from your doctors, who need the full picture, whether it’s pretty or not. You’re allowed to say, “I’m getting through it, but it’s still hard,” and you deserve people in your corner who can hear that without panicking or minimizing it, no matter how uncomfortable it may make them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UZORQBPD3NGXNKHFJDA4DSTYZM"&gt;Healing doesn’t happen overnight.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Dr. Molly O’Shea has noticed growing skepticism about &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccine-schedule-trump-rfk-hhs-9b8df9e2767c1261aaac4e2331e77fa3"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at both of her Michigan pediatric offices and says this week’s unprecedented and confusing changes to federal vaccine guidance will only make things worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her offices is in a Democratic area, where more of the parents she sees are opting for alternative schedules that spread out &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-childhood-vaccines-fact-check-17c0cb6f2f208f11b3474b96d1726945"&gt;shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The other is in a Republican area, where some parents have &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fluoride-kennedy-trump-science-antiscience-legislation-73af8e65f407331e8f31b2909812a004"&gt;stopped immunizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; their children altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and other doctors fear the new recommendations and the terminology around them will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents that make it harder for kids to get shots, and ultimately lead to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-measles-polio-whooping-cough-rubella-af4cd1aef8f408a960601df6372f9c32"&gt;more illness and death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change was to stop blanket recommendations for protection against six diseases and recommend those vaccines only for at-risk children or through something called “shared clinical decision-making” with a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The phrase, experts say, is confusing and dangerous: “It sends a message to a parent that actually there’s only a rarefied group of people who really need the vaccine,” O’Shea said. “It’s creating an environment that puts a sense of uncertainty about the value and necessity or importance of the vaccines in that category.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rfk-gold-standard-science-research-autism-6e4c6bc2534252ab1e7add0942043778"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years, said in announcing the changes that they better align the U.S. with peer nations “while strengthening transparency and informed consent.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;But doctors say they are sowing doubt — the vaccines have been extensively studied and proven to be safe and effective at shielding kids from nasty diseases — at a time when childhood vaccination rates &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-rates-cdc-kindergarten-0d261546a130dc256735d7b1ff8c6a5f"&gt;are already falling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/us-flu-cases-cdc-subclade-k-29cc5a68eb100585c8e0dbd2ec47b3eb"&gt;some of those infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics and more than 200 medical, public health and patient advocacy groups sent &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdownloads.aap.org%2FDOFA%2FChildhood%2520Vaccine%2520Schedule%2520Joint%2520Letter%2520Final.pdf&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Clungar%40ap.org%7Ca1fb226ec30c4cdff05c08de4fc36b97%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C639035898073595504%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=o8rZF2%2BTwKkMqKrfe0eboUu%2FPrvyzOuqOuUveQ9lD8o%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a letter to Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; about the new childhood immunization schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We urge you to investigate why the schedule was changed, why credible scientific evidence was ignored, and why the committee charged with advising the HHS Secretary on immunizations did not discuss the schedule changes as a part of their public meeting process,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Many don’t know what ’shared decision-making’ means&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Shea said she and other pediatricians discuss vaccines with parents at every visit where they are given. But that’s not necessarily “shared clinical decision-making,” which has a particular definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its website, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says: “Unlike routine, catch-up, and risk-based recommendations, shared clinical decision-making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk group. Rather, shared clinical decision-making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, health care providers include primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;A pair of surveys conducted last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggested that many people don’t fully understand the concept, which &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;came up last year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when the federal government changed recommendations around COVID-19 vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults knew that one meaning behind shared decision-making is that “taking the vaccine may not be a good idea for everyone but would benefit some.” And only about one-third realized pharmacists count as health care providers to talk with during the process, even though they frequently administer vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of this week, vaccines that protect against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, RSV, flu and meningococcal disease are no longer universally recommended for kids. RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain high-risk populations; flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended through shared decision-making — as is the COVID-19 vaccine, although that change was made last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the federal announcement Monday, Dr. Steven Abelowitz heard from half a dozen parents. “It’s causing concern for us, but more importantly, concern for parents with kids, especially young kids, and confusion,” said Abelowitz, founder of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though federal recommendations are not mandates — states have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren — they can affect how easy it is for kids to get shots if doctors choose to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new guidelines, O’Shea said, parents seeking shots in the shared decision-making category might no longer bring their kids in for a quick, vaccine-only appointment with staff. They’d sit down with a health care provider and discuss the vaccine. And it could be tougher to have a flu clinic, where parents drive up and kids get shots without seeing a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Staying the course as challenges mount&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, doctors say they won’t let the changes stop them from helping children get the vaccines they need. Leading medical groups are sticking with prior vaccine recommendations. Many parents are, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Megan Landry, whose 4-year-old son Zackary is one of O’Shea’s patients, is among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s my responsibility as a parent to protect my child’s health and well-being,” she said. “Vaccines are a really effective and well-studied way to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She plans to keep having the same conversations she’s always had with O’Shea before getting vaccines for Zackary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Relying on evidence and trusted medical guidance really helps me to make those decisions,” she said. “And for me, it’s not just a personal choice for my own son but a way to contribute to the health of everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for other families, confidence about vaccines is waning as trust in science erodes. O’Shea lamented that parents are getting the message that they can’t trust medical experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I take my car to the mechanic, I don’t go do my own research ahead of time,” she said. “I go to a person I trust and I trust them to tell me what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abelowitz, the California doctor, likened the latest federal move to pouring gasoline on a fire of mistrust that was already burning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re worried the fire’s out of control,” he said. “Already we’ve seen that with measles and pertussis, there are increased hospitalizations and even increasing deaths. So the way that I look at it — and my colleagues look at it — we’re basically regressing decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

                                        &lt;p&gt;When Sarah Baldassaro turned 50, she took stock of her health and began working with a fitness coach on &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/weightlighting-train-to-failure-exercise-9f8781dac9ecdc9e75471ac546881d39"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a type of exercise that’s crucial for &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/menopause-hormone-therapy-hot-flashes-0f3258f1762e1fb3c9a6f7205a43e66e"&gt;women in midlife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now I would say I’m stronger overall than I ever have been at any age,” said Baldassaro, 52, of Alexandria, Virginia. “My fitness level is much more like when I was in my early 30s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts say &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/strength-training-excercise-4eb437efde74b4dc5e937c53f26ff528"&gt;strength training keeps bones and muscles healthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; after &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/hormone-therapy-estrogen-hot-flashes-fda-5b1f29a73553c142f67b1f88b6656428"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when estrogen loss speeds up a reduction in bone density and contributes to the gradual loss of muscle mass. This type of exercise — which involves working against resistance — also helps women maintain a healthy weight and stay on track with New Year’s resolutions about fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People underestimate how powerful it is,” said Dr. Christina DeAngelis, an OB-GYN at Penn State Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what should your workout look like and how do you get started?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Strength training with weights&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical therapist Hilary Granat said bone and muscle health are intertwined: When muscle pulls on bone during resistance training, it stimulates bone-building cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance can come from dumbbells, free weights or machines such as rowers. One example of a strength training exercise is the chest press, which involves lying back on a bench or the ground, pressing weights up from chest level and then lowering them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to work “close to muscle failure,” said Granat, who owns Core Total Wellness in Washington, D.C. “You really have to push yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means lifting weights that are heavy enough to be challenging and doing somewhere between six and 30 repetitions.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;You’ll know you’re working hard enough if you start slowing down in tempo or speed or can’t do another repetition in good form, she said. A good rule of thumb for an exercise like a bicep curl is to lift weights somewhere between 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) and 20 pounds (9.1 kilograms), with novices starting at the lower end.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Baldassaro has worked her way up to 20 pounds (9.1 kilograms) for some exercises, incorporating techniques she learned from Granat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the health coach has helped her expand her workouts beyond mostly cardio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she still does aerobic exercises, “the strength training has really been the difference maker for me,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No weights? No problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building up bones and muscles doesn’t necessarily require equipment. You can also do pushups, squats, lunges, situps, crunches or planks. Another good exercise is squatting down with your back against a wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the simple act of getting into and out of a chair can be helpful, DeAngelis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to engage your core going from sitting to standing,” she said. “That also allows you to work on your coordination and balance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also what Granat calls “impact training” — exercises like walking, hiking, running, jumping, skipping and climbing stairs. On the high-impact end of the spectrum is a “rebound jump,” which involves jumping up and down from a step 10 to 30 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not talking about jumping hard and fast and a lot,” she said, adding that three times a week is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t forget about balance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say middle-aged women should also perform balance exercises, which play a crucial role in preventing falls that can break or fracture bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include tai chi, yoga or even standing on one leg while brushing your teeth for around 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these exercises are great for younger people too, experts say, especially since bone mass peaks at 25 to 30 years old and slowly begins to lessen around age 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seeing how strength training has improved her life, Baldassaro advises others: “Don’t wait. Get started.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;———-&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

In the average flu season, vaccines have a 40-60% efficacy in reducing the incidence of severe illness, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-24" data-gaid="inarticle-24"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YXRIT7EYPNA5XKAHTVH2BG563E"&gt;“I want to be very clear, vaccination is still the best way to protect ourselves and the population against influenza and severe illness related to influenza,” said Butt, who has more than three decades of experience in infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-25" data-gaid="inarticle-25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4SAQXJDJOZCPVFOPBPEXFFM7OM"&gt;There’s a common misconception that getting the flu shot will give you the flu. However, Butt said that’s not possible “because none of the vaccines recommended by the CDC contain active, live virus.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-26" data-gaid="inarticle-26"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MNFENVF4QZHPHFKINDRHL73BWI"&gt;Flu vaccines may use viral proteins, inactivated viruses, or even small portions of the virus capsule to teach the immune system how to fight off germs. But they don’t contain the active flu virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IRUQFZS3PFCPRA65JUBU7Y3YSE"&gt;There are other reasons why you may still get sick, despite receiving a flu shot. It’s possible the symptoms may be the result of a different infection, not the flu. It’s also possible that exposure to the virus happened before the vaccine had time to kick in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CHHMOJ344BATLCGU44L6DNLAUY"&gt;It takes about two weeks for antibodies to develop in the body following vaccination, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MYTFMFEDGVGLFIDCFCB3NAW6GI"&gt;So, the vaccine can’t completely prevent infection, but it does reduce your chances of getting infected. Its main strength is preventing the worst-case scenario — severe illness and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-heading"&gt;Is there still time to get a flu shot?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OU4F2KXB7JFOJFBOSV6XKF5M7I"&gt;Yes! The good news is that it’s not too late to try and prevent getting sick.

&lt;p&gt;Or, more accurately, we &lt;em&gt;were &lt;/em&gt;NIH scientists and administrators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2025, we anticipated changes with the new administration, but expected that rigorous scientific inquiry would continue to be valued. After all, the country’s health research infrastructure, considered the most prestigious in the world, had always garnered broad bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the year, as we witnessed the Trump administration’s reckless policies, we tried to protect the science we had always championed. We spoke up when we could, and in June we joined hundreds of our colleagues in signing the &lt;a href="https://www.standupforscience.net/bethesda-declaration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bethesda Declaration&lt;/a&gt;, an open letter to the NIH director detailing how several new policies were undermining scientific integrity and the institute’s mission. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we can no longer lend our credibility to an organization that has lost its integrity. In recent months, each of us independently reached the decision to resign in protest of the actions of an administration that treats science not as a process for building knowledge, but as a means to advance its political agenda. One of us resigned just Friday. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have resigned because:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We protest the hypocrisy of an NIH leadership that claims to protect academic freedom while censoring grants and staff communication. Instead of applying our skills and knowledge to science, we have been instructed to tell scientists competing for NIH funding to remove words like “equity,” “diversity,” “minority,” and “underserved,” regardless of the scientific appropriateness of these terms or the significance of the projects. To this day, grants continue to be “realigned” with administration priorities, a clear form of ideological coercion. The damage to research and destabilizing effects on the scientific workforce will be long lasting.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;We protest an NIH leadership that &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/nih-director/statements/advancing-nihs-mission-through-unified-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; to champion early-career scientists and prioritize “solutions-oriented” health disparities research while selectively terminating and censoring these awards. We witnessed unilateral withdrawals of applications and terminations of active awards to early-career scientists simply because they had applied to funding announcements designed to broaden participation in the scientific workforce. The progress or promise of this science was never considered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, funding announcements that solicited research to address health disparities were disappeared from the public record because they were deemed “DEI.” Associated applications were withdrawn without review and awards were terminated. Some of these applications and awards were in our portfolios and we urged reconsideration of these actions, providing justifications based on the awards’ merit and even its actual alignment with publicly stated priorities. Our requests went unanswered and the grantees’ appeals were ignored. These decisions will hurt American communities and stifle scientific advancements for decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We protest an NIH leadership that creates a culture of fear within the agency’s dedicated staff. Colleagues who question illegal and politically motivated orders have been silenced, with some &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/14/nih-puts-trump-critic-on-administrative-leave/"&gt;placed on leave &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/16/nih-jeanne-marrazzo-sues-trump-administration-over-dismissal/"&gt;forced out&lt;/a&gt;. Each of us has been told not to push back because “people would lose their jobs.” Refrains heard in the hallways include: “What I’m being asked to do feels wrong, but I need my health insurance” and “we have to keep our heads down and avoid putting a target on our backs.” These should not be concerns articulated in a world-class scientific institution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upholding our oath of office — “to protect and defend the Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic” — and living up to our values requires us to leave the jobs we previously cherished.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are by no means the only ones leaving. Many of our colleagues have resigned, have retired earlier than planned, or are actively taking steps to leave the NIH, sometimes at great personal sacrifice. Other colleagues are wrestling with whether the costs of staying outweighs the costs of leaving.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In sharing our personal reasons for leaving, we hope to let our colleagues know they are not alone in recognizing the harms that are undermining the agency they loved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A stable research funding infrastructure is essential to solve the country’s health challenges and to support a functional democracy where policy is based on evidence. Despite leaving the NIH, we refuse to lose hope. We remain committed to the work of advancing science and improving public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To researchers whose work lifts up vulnerable communities and who have devoted their work to currently “sensitive” topics — vaccines, health equity, the health of sexual and gender minorities, climate change, misinformation: We need to continue to speak up and speak out. We also need to work together to build new opportunities for this critical work until the NIH returns to its mission. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To our colleagues who plan to remain at the NIH and those who continue to seek funding from the NIH: The options in front of us are not good: continue in a compromised process or refuse to participate and risk professional stability.  We wish all of you well as you continue to weigh the impact of your choices on the scientific enterprise and on the communities across the nation. We know you seek to do your best to navigate the ethical and practical challenges and uphold the moral and scientific integrity. We are already moving down the slippery slope. Please decide where your red line is so you can choose to act before the line is already behind you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only is our health at stake, but this attack on science is an attack on freedom of speech and thought. What we have seen at NIH is a threat to the fundamental freedoms that all of us cherish.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we can fight back. The biggest lesson the four of us have learned over this past year is that what feels impossible and overwhelming when you’re sitting by yourself can begin to feel achievable and urgent when you are working with others that share your values. Working together, we can preserve our moral and scientific integrity. We can rebuild a robust biomedical research ecosystem free from heedless political interference. Acting boldly now will help to protect democracy and ensure better health for all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sylvia Chou, Ph.D., MPH, resigned Friday from the position of program director at the National Cancer Institute. Paul Grothaus, Ph.D., retired on Dec. 31, 2025, earlier than planned, from the position of program officer at the National Institute of Aging. Alexa Romberg, Ph.D., resigned Dec. 8, 2025, from the position of deputy chief of the Prevention Research Branch at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Vani Pariyadath, Ph.D., resigned June 14, 2025, from the position of chief of the Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Branch at the National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But kids who regularly sit and play on the floor may be onto something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really think from a health benefits or a musculoskeletal condition standpoint, that [cross-legged sitting] posture really does help us with ... hip, low back and knee range of motion,” said &lt;a href="https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/people/christopher-bise" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Christopher Bise" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69616c0be4b08ce691f7cdea" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/people/christopher-bise" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Christopher Bise&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in the department of physical therapy at the University of Pittsburgh. It also helps keep our lower body flexible, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/physicians_oconnell-jennifer.asp" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jennifer O’Connell" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69616c0be4b08ce691f7cdea" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.hss.edu/physicians_oconnell-jennifer.asp" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Jennifer O’Connell&lt;/a&gt;, a physiatrist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, added that “one of the problems with sitting in a chair is that it’s a position where your hamstrings tend to be tight — sitting in a cross legged position may help that somewhat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you aren’t able to get yourself down to the floor, you can still work on your mobility and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remember that these positions don’t necessarily have to be on the floor. You can, on a couch, get in to the cross-legged sitting position, or you can use different sitting positions on the couch that will also increase your range of motion, as well,” Bise explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a good range of motion is important as you age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining your range of motion is important for many reasons — you’ll be better able to get around your house, do your errands, and play with children and grandchildren as your years increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I think one of the things that happens when we get older is ... we become less flexible because we begin to slow down ― but we don’t have to be less flexible,” Bise said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And when you think about the treatments you’re going to receive from a physical therapist ... one of the first things they’re going to do is assess both your joint mobility and your muscle flexibility for the muscles around your joints and see how they’re moving,” Bise continued. “And when we have bones and joints and muscles that are inflexible, that are stiffer, we’re not going to move as well or as efficiently as we could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going from sitting on the ground, to the chair, to walking and exercising is a great way to keep yourself mobile and flexible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the ability to actually get into and out of a seated-on-the-floor posture is also important, Bise said. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/older-patients-aging-geriatricians_l_6515e29ee4b055cbc0a72975" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Older adults" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69616c0be4b08ce691f7cdea" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="6515e29ee4b055cbc0a72975" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Older adults&lt;/a&gt; are prone to falls, he said, but if they have the ability to rise and lower to and from the floor, they’ll be more able to prevent falls in the future or get themselves up if need be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: PeopleImages via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;PeopleImages via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Sitting on the ground can be a good way to maintain your range of motion and flexibility. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sitting on the ground can work your core, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting on the ground engages your core muscles in a way that just doesn’t happen when you’re sitting on a chair, according to O’Connell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without back support from a chair, your core muscles automatically turn on, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then just the mere act of getting up from that position is beneficial for your whole body. You’re exercising your hips, your knees, your entire lower chain and your core in order to get up,” O’Connell explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But this doesn’t mean you should sit on the ground &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try sitting on the ground for 30 minutes or so, but you should not plop down on the floor for the entire day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a reason that your Apple Watch reminds you every 60 minutes to get up and start moving again ... some of it is postural, some of it is just simple motion and getting calories going, but some of it is also changing postures as well,” Bise noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Connell said that she routinely tells her patients who work desk jobs to get up and move around — whether that’s walking to get a glass of water or just moving around the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before you know it, an hour to two hours have gone by, you didn’t get up and move.

Many patients have described vomiting “yellow bile” as one of the standout symptoms of their flu infection, according to a report on &lt;a href="https://www.healthandme.com/health-news/unique-symptoms-of-flu-in-2026-and-how-long-infection-now-last-article-153402967" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.healthandme.com/health-news/unique-symptoms-of-flu-in-2026-and-how-long-infection-now-last-article-153402967"&gt;Healthandme.com. &lt;/a&gt;Virologists said they believe this may happen because the flu is suppressing appetite more than usual, leading people to vomit when their stomachs are empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-15" data-gaid="inarticle-15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MAAIGZAR2NCIZBZOJJADL6COYY"&gt;Vomiting and diarrhea are more common in children than adults, the CDC reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-16" data-gaid="inarticle-16"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6VO2NCZUPNEHDLYGNJ4WV2KO3I"&gt;Most common symptoms of the circulating variant include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-17" data-gaid="inarticle-17"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article__unordered-list"&gt;&lt;li id="V4LZ2KUFMVCVJHY4SNKXMMJG5Q"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cough&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="CX3X7JKFXFH5LNMI3RTMEGFQTQ"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sore throat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="DJJ23BQLPNB3ZLPUL44XKQZJFI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Runny or stuffy nose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="QNBLJJVFYBFL7LXRNLPUNJLQJU"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Muscle or body aches&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="ADISOIA5EBGI7M6G2HE3VEWEUI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Headache&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="SJE5WNOMDRGKBATTVBYSRF7LHU"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fatigue &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-18" data-gaid="inarticle-18"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JOLYBYAACZF7TAGZWI6AQZZ3GE"&gt;The flu is more dangerous for the pediatric population, as children can experience more GI symptoms, like vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration, Sharma said, noting that some children may present with a bacterial pneumonia compounded with the flu virus, which can cause breathing difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-19" data-gaid="inarticle-19"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6OF3J2657JF25OEOXCZJNG4K7E"&gt;“Severe complications occur in 6% to 20% of hospitalized children, including pneumonia as well as other bacterial co-infections, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation,’' Sharma said.

Eoghan’s cancer, Ewing sarcoma, was far rarer still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mrs Homan said: “On the island, it’s very difficult, because with paediatric cancer, children are sent away for treatment, and for children that survive — they’re a young family; children have to go back to school and their day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It’s a busy time, and the island really doesn’t have a support group for paediatric cancer caregivers, parents and survivors. It’s a difficult one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Additionally, the drugs powerful enough to fight cancer are highly toxic, she said, complicating the recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“There are issues with diabetes, heart problems, secondary cancers, and there isn’t a lot of awareness about that either.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;St Baldrick’s announced its&lt;a href="https://blog.stbaldricks.org/meet-the-2026-st-baldricks-ambassadors/" id="link-e87feedbc5c9376aa31e2c00d150ebc0" target="_blank"&gt; five ambassadors&lt;/a&gt; this week. Each child represents a different story in the worldwide community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mr Homan said: “Each year, they will pick one child who has passed away. Through the work Niamh has been doing, and the link-up Bermuda Cancer and Health Centre has with St Baldrick’s, they became aware of our story and thought it resonated with what they’re looking to promote.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Eoghan’s story will be highlighted through the foundation and its social media on February 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Beyond education and fundraising, Mr Homan said it marks “a chance to share our experience of being a family dealing with a child going through a cancer diagnosis, and helping people understand what that means”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Eoghan was a distinguished runner, and shared the sport with his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_image_caption image_text" data-uuid="c2c885b1-a720-53e9-bebd-96c027325d52"&gt;Eoghan Homan breasts the tape at the finish line of the 2020 Butterfield Front Street Mile, in which he was middle school boys’ champion (File photograph by Blaire Simmons)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In the years since, Mr Homan has taken his marathon running to &lt;a href="https://www.royalgazette.com/running-triathlon/sport/article/20250426/colm-homan-to-run-second-marathon-in-six-days-for-cancer-research/" id="link-4e9bf9255fefe3bb2c389529ed6396c8" target="_blank"&gt;fundraising heights&lt;/a&gt; in tandem with Boston Children’s Hospital, where Eoghan fought through 14 months of gruelling treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mr Homan said: “We had a high level of confidence that he was getting the best care he could, and the best chance that he would have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Unfortunately, one in five children diagnosed with cancer will not survive it. Eoghan was one of those five.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In the marathon next week for the Bermuda Triangle Challenge, father and daughter will run together to fundraise for the Boston Children’s Hospital research fund named in Eoghan’s memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mr Homan will run the full marathon, and join Aisling at the halfway mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He said: “We should be able to meet up and run the rest of it together — if I can keep up with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It’s been really special that she’s taken to running with passion, having never run more than a mile just five months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It means a lot that she is going to be running for Boston Children’s Hospital and the fund we have named after Eoghan specifically targeting research into Ewing sarcoma and neuroblastoma, which we know are two of the rarer cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;He added: “That’s one of the things St Baldrick’s has done a great job with, identifying projects specifically around those lesser-known cancers, so that there is hope for people that receive one of those diagnoses, and they’re able to work through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Mr Homan said: “I think cancer should be almost redefined. There are so many that are totally treatable and it’s not the end of your life. Others are extremely severe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;St Baldrick’s will proceed with its signature head-shaving fundraiser in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;In the meantime, Eoghan’s family join the other work connected with the movement — sharing the lessons of their experience and joining the broader support network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“It’s more than the fundraising,” Mrs Homan said. “It’s the awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist drugs, like the popular weight-loss jabs Wegovy and Ozempic, have proven to be immensely effective. Beyond allowing patients to significantly reduce their weight, they’ve been shown to have a &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/glp-1-ozempic-benefits-map"&gt;constellation of other health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-delays-aging-scientist-claims"&gt;lowering the risk of heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and staving off &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/semaglutide-diabetic-kidney-disease"&gt;diabetic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/doctors-surprised-patients-semaglutide-cured-other-conditions"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/ozempic-lowered-alzheimers-risk"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But the harsh reality of &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/glp1-weight-gain"&gt;what happens when monthly injections stop&lt;/a&gt; is raising a grim wrinkle: will patients ever be able to &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; taking these extremely expensive drugs, or are they signing onto a lifetime habit they won’t be able to break without suffering severe consequences?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-085304" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at the University of Oxford, which reviewed 37 existing weight loss medication studies involving over 9,000 participants, has found that patients who stopped taking GLP-1 weight-loss medications regained weight four times as fast as those who used alternative behavioral programs, like diets and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;On average, participants returned to their original weight just 1.7 years after stopping the medication. Patients who went off the drugs &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn98pdpyjz5o" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt; that the hunger came roaring back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“It was like something opened up in my mind and said: ‘Eat everything, go on, you deserve it because you haven’t eaten anything for so long,'” Tanya Hall, who has been on and off GLP-1 injections, told the broadcaster at the time, adding that she felt “completely horrified” by the amount of food she was consuming after just a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Worse yet, the Oxford-led research team found that the secondary health benefits of the drugs dissipated as well. They observed that health markers, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, bounced back to original levels within an average of 1.4 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This review found that cessation of [weight management medications] is followed by rapid weight regain and reversal of beneficial effects on cardiometabolic markers,” the researchers wrote. “These findings suggest caution in short-term use of these drugs without a more comprehensive approach to weight management.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The researchers suggest that the drugs alone don’t form lasting lifestyle changes that persist after you stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This faster regain could be because people using drugs don’t need to consciously practise changing their diet to lose weight, so when they stop taking the medication, they might not have developed the practical strategies that could help them keep it off,” said senior author and Oxford associate professor Dimitrios Koutoukidis in an &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2026-01-08-new-study-finds-stopping-weight-loss-drugs-linked-faster-regain-ending-diet" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;official statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The scientists are now calling for a more careful approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“These medicines are transforming obesity treatment and can achieve important weight loss,” said lead author and University of Oxford research scientist Sam West in the statement. “However, our research shows that people tend to regain weight rapidly after stopping — faster than we see with behavioral programs.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;However, that doesn’t mean GLP-1 drugs aren’t still astonishingly effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“This isn’t a failing of the medicines — it reflects the nature of obesity as a chronic, relapsing condition,” West added. “It sounds a cautionary note for short-term use without a more comprehensive approach to long-term weight management, and highlights the importance of primary prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Others advocate for a more holistic prescription model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Weight loss drugs can be effective tools for managing weight and type 2 diabetes risk — but this research reinforces that they are not a quick fix,” Diabetes UK research communications lead Faye Riley &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/jan/07/weight-loss-jabs-regain-two-years-health-study" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “They need to be prescribed appropriately, with tailored wraparound support alongside them, to ensure people can fully benefit and maintain weight loss for as long as possible when they stop taking the medication.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on GLP-1s:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/health-medicine/glp1-weight-gain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something Grim Is Happening to People Who Go Off GLP-1s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Two weeks after the first twinge of pain in her belly, doctors diagnosed Umanita with colon cancer. It granted her unwanted membership to a growing club of young adults who have developed a cancer once thought to primarily affect the elderly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Everything felt like it was out of a dream — well, a nightmare, I guess,” Umanita said. “It just didn’t feel real.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For years, researchers have noted an alarming rise in &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/07/22/metro/rise-cancer-among-younger-people-worries-puzzles-doctors/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/07/22/metro/rise-cancer-among-younger-people-worries-puzzles-doctors/"&gt;colorectal cancer in younger people&lt;/a&gt; that’s not fully explained away by growing awareness and testing. People under 55 accounted&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for one-fifth of the 145,000 new colorectal cancer diagnoses in 2019, an &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf"&gt;American Cancer Society report&lt;/a&gt; showed — double the rate in 1995.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;By 2024, it had become the leading cause of cancer deaths in men under 50 and the second for women in that age group, according to the &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21820" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Scientists are zeroing in on some likely culprits, particularly diet and ultraprocessed foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Those issues are of particular interest to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said such foods are “poisoning” people and contributing to high incidence of health problems in the country. On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/07/nation/new-us-dietary-guidelines-processed-foods-added-sugar/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/07/nation/new-us-dietary-guidelines-processed-foods-added-sugar/"&gt;Kennedy issued new dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that encourage a “dramatic reduction” in highly processed foods with added salt and sugar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Boston’s academic medical centers are at the forefront of research&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the role of such foods, harnessing data from patients such as Umanita to investigate why otherwise healthy young adults are developing devastating cancers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A recent study led by MGB researchers found &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2841354?guestAccessKey=f519cbac-0500-444e-a957-91e4ae77c2e7&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=111325" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2841354?guestAccessKey=f519cbac-0500-444e-a957-91e4ae77c2e7&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=111325"&gt;a connection between consumption of ultraprocessed foods&lt;/a&gt; — premade foods that are often high in sugar, salt, saturated fat, and additives — and the development of precancerous polyps. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve been focusing on some things that we know to be risk factors in older adults, but we know that’s not the complete answer,” said one of the study’s authors, Dr. Andrew Chan, at Mass. General. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There’s still a lot more to be discovered,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As promising as the new research is, experts are still flummoxed by the high numbers of colorectal cancer in young adults. Some cancers have clear causes: lung cancer is almost always caused by smoking. Nearly all cervical cancer cases are tied to human papillomavirus. But colorectal cancers are likely the result of a kaleidoscope of factors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Everyone in Umanita’s life, it seems, has an opinion on what caused her  cancer, since she had no obvious genetic predisposition. Some people say it was her diet. Her parents think it’s microplastics. Others blame the COVID-19 vaccine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“And of course that’s not true,” Umanita said. “But they try to look for an answer of why a girl my age would get cancer and I don’t have one.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It didn’t hit Umanita until she was home from her initial hospital stay. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The hospital was distracting. There were constant tests, endless blood draws. She was fed through a tube, unable to eat by mouth for days. She dreamed of getting out and eating grilled cheese with tomato soup and special lemon Twizzlers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Once she was able to, Umanita started her cancer treatment. Many people in her position might take the semester off, but she couldn’t stand the idea of spending her days thinking only about her diagnosis. She opted to take a full courseload and work as a teaching assistant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "&gt;&lt;span class="caption | margin_right_half"&gt;Massachusetts General Hospital &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit uppercase"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Other doctors noticed an uptick in colon cancer in middle-aged and even young adults around that time. They weren’t sure why. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Screening explains some of the increased diagnoses. An American Cancer Society study found that screening in the 45 to 49 age group increased by 62 percent from 2019 to 2023 after the group lowered its age recommendation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But this doesn’t catch individuals under 45, whose colon cancer rates have also climbed. Younger patients are more likely to ignore the subtle symptoms — pain, irregular bowel movements, bloody stool — that point to trouble. Often, they arrive at the oncologist sicker than elderly patients with the same disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are established risk factors for colon cancer, Chan said, including being overweight or physically inactive. In older adults, diets heavy in red meat and high-sugar foods were also linked to the disease. Was this the case for younger adults too? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Chan and other researchers are furiously investigating potential causes, by studying healthy individuals over their lifetime as well as those such as Umanita who come into the hospital diagnosed with early-onset colon cancer. She is a subject in one of Chan’s studies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/13/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-colorectal-cancer-women/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/13/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-colorectal-cancer-women/?p1=BGSearch_Overlay_Results"&gt;His team’s recently published a study&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Oncology showing that soda, chips, and other ultraprocessed foods could be at least partially to blame for the polyps that precede colon cancer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;They analyzed the diets of nearly 30,000 women under the age of 50 and found those who ate the highest levels of ultraprocessed foods had a 45 percent higher risk of developing precancerous polyps in the colon, compared to those who ate the lowest levels of ultraprocessed foods. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The connection between food and cancer didn’t surprise Dr. Lilian Chen, chief of colorectal surgery at Tufts Medical Center, who referred to herself as a “surgical plumber.” Chen was not involved in the study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Whatever goes into our body, basically the inside of our colon is seeing and processing,” Chen said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Still, ultraprocessed foods alone don’t explain the rise in colon cancer. There are many patients Chan sees who have healthy diets and are physically active. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“These standard risk factors don’t apply to everybody,” Chan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The other big question is whether damage from years of unhealthy eating can be undone. That’s what Chan plans to study next. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In March, after surgery and 12 rounds of chemo, Umanita rang the bell at Mass. General to signal when a patient is done with cancer treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The hard part was over, she thought. But the transition back to normal life took her by surprise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Umanita’s oncologist, Dr. Aparna Parikh, said the most emotionally difficult visit they had was in October, more than six months after she finished her last cycle of chemo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve gotta keep a close eye on her and support her mental health through this, because she’s not OK, even though she has this entire time been strong and resilient,” Parikh recalled thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;During Umanita’s treatment, everything was moving at light speed. Then, one day, it just stopped. She no longer had that to focus all her energy on. And because of her youth, few people around her could relate to her experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vl58t000x27nnauii6pyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Teresa Sanchez was in Mexico for a medical procedure nearly four years ago when she kept feeling dry, poking sensations in her right eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700063b6po3n97ycm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She chalked it up to a potential rip in her contact lens, the general dryness she had felt since she started wearing monthly contacts instead of dailies or her body possibly fighting off an illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700073b6pyzv6zc7m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But what she wouldn’t know for another three months was that a little invader was waging war against her cornea, permanently destroying her vision and causing intense, burning pain that radiated &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/29/health/migraine-explainer-wellness"&gt;throughout her head&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700083b6pib0khks5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I couldn’t have my blinds open in my room, because that would trigger really, really bad pain in my eye,” Sanchez, 33 and based in Las Vegas, said of a harrowing moment after about three months&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; of being misdiagnosed by optometrists. “That’s how I knew it was something serious, and I started doing my own research.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700093b6poy4wrrfq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sanchez learned online that her symptoms appeared consistent  with those of a rare disease, acanthamoeba keratitis. An eye specialist later confirmed Sanchez’s suspicion. Keratitis refers to inflammation of the cornea, the eye’s protective, dome-shaped outer layer that plays a key role in vision.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000a3b6pcy9szbgw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acanthamoeba, a single-cell organism that doesn’t need a host to survive and is commonly found in water and soil sources, is one of many pathogens or microbes that can cause keratitis, said Dr. Jacob Lorenzo-Morales,     professor of parasitology at the University of La Laguna in Spain, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000b3b6pqbhbi1ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once the opportunistic parasite is on the eye’s surface, it adheres to the cornea, said Dr. Paul Barney, an optometric physician and center director of the Pacific Cataract and Laser Institute in Anchorage, Alaska. If there are breaks in the corneal epithelium — a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21562-cornea" target="_blank"&gt;thin, barrier layer&lt;/a&gt; of cells that are extremely sensitive to pain — they allow the parasite to burrow into the cornea, Barney said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000c3b6p6gwhj552@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare disease, noted Barney, also a trustee of the American Optometric Association. There are over 23,000 cases worldwide annually, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876034123001016" target="_blank"&gt;according to 2023 data&lt;/a&gt; on just 20 countries, including Brazil, Canada, the United Kingdom, India and the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000d3b6p6p6dkgcd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But it’s worth noting that about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12194555/" target="_blank"&gt;85% to 95%&lt;/a&gt; of the people who get infected wear contact lenses, which create conditions favorable to acanthamoeba. Contacts can cause those corneal abrasions that provide the pathogen with a point of entry; acanthamoeba can also hitch a ride on the surface of a lens or become trapped between a contact and the eye, making burrowing deeper possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000e3b6peyl4pkdz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having acanthamoeba keratitis “can be quite devastating if it’s not diagnosed promptly and treated aggressively,” Barney said. “It basically uses the cornea as its food source, and that causes inflammation and tissue damage and then can eventually cause permanent loss of vision.” Some patients’ vision can be somewhat restored with proper treatment or fully resolved by getting a cornea transplant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000f3b6pf7x2lvm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The hardy  parasite is also highly attuned to threats and responds with formidable defense mechanisms — prolonging a treatment process that’s already months to years long and often fraught with other hurdles and pain.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Because of acanthamoeba’s extraordinary resilience and the eye’s sensitivity, working closely with your eye professional and following their guidance is crucial.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000g3b6pv3pftfi9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Diagnosing acanthamoeba keratitis early on can be challenging for a few reasons.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000h3b6plnthgnpr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rarity of the condition means many optometrists don’t know about it — which likely explains why many contact lens wearers never hear about acanthamoeba keratitis until they contract it themselves or see viral social media posts on the condition, such as &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZThJTECwd/" target="_blank"&gt;Sanchez’s TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;. Many contact-wearing commenters on these posts say they are shocked they had never been warned by optometrists or the fine print on contact lens packaging about not showering or swimming while wearing contacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000i3b6pio8erawy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Contact Lens Society of America said via email that “contact lenses are medical devices, and care and hygiene instructions — including avoiding contact with water while swimming, showering, or sleeping — are an important part of routine contact lens care.” The CLSA is a network of members from the eye care field and the contact lens manufacturing and services industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000j3b6pq6vfe27h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The society added that it “encourages clear, ongoing communication by providers and active engagement by patients — including asking questions, reviewing written materials, and talking through any uncertainties about safe lens use.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000k3b6pyn07lls6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to pain, light sensitivity and obscured vision, acanthamoeba keratitis &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acanthamoeba/hcp/clinical-overview-acanthamoeba-keratitis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;can also cause&lt;/a&gt; redness, dryness, excessive tears and a sensation of a foreign body in the eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000l3b6p7j0fc1sg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lack of awareness of the disease and some acanthamoeba keratitis symptoms mimicking those of other corneal infections make it easy for optometrists to misdiagnose patients, Barney said. The most common misdiagnosis is herpes simplex keratitis, &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/ophthalmology/research_herpes.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;a leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of infection-induced blindness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000m3b6p6m9mfk22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the earliest stages, acanthamoeba keratitis can even seem like pink eye, which Sanchez said was her optometrist’s diagnosis when she saw him about a month after she started having symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000n3b6p30kmmh1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Accordingly, the treatments misprescribed can be ineffective at best and harmful at worst, all while the parasite further destroys the cornea. Drops for viral pink eye blurred Sanchez’s vision, she said. A second optometrist thought Sanchez had bacterial pink eye; antibacterial drops worked for a bit before she completely lost vision in the infected eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000o3b6p8dr3t6xz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grace Jamison, a 20-year-old woman in the western United States, had a similar experience. Jamison developed acanthamoeba keratitis in both eyes after wearing her contacts while showering in the Dominican Republic in May. When she arrived back home several weeks later, her optometrist misdiagnosed her and prescribed steroid drops. After just another week, Jamison was blind — and she remained that way for about two months before she began proper treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000p3b6prtymcvuk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of the time, we don’t realize how good life is or how there’s so many things that can go wrong,” Jamison said. “It’s so sad that we don’t appreciate what we have when we do have it. When I was completely blind in both of my eyes, I regretted not taking advantage of how I could see before.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000q3b6pbqtc0atn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I regretted not being on screens less, just looking at how beautiful outside is, or looking at people that I know and love.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000r3b6pcvb6szym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The cause of Jamison’s clouded vision is damage from an inflammatory response to the pathogen.
    &lt;/p&gt;





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000s3b6pggm3o03o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s times when I get really sad and I wish that my right eye didn’t look like it didn’t have a pupil,” Jamison said. “And occasionally I get people in public that are like, ‘What’s going on with your eye?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001b3b6pv7o9ax62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Want to reduce your chances of getting acanthamoeba keratitis? When cleaning and storing contacts, always use store-bought or prescription   contact solution instead of water, experts said. The solution in your contacts case should also be changed every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001c3b6pmdz8niqx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washing and drying your hands before applying contacts is important for preventing eye infections from various sources. Never wear your lenses while asleep, either, since that can cause dryness, irritation, abrasions and entrapment of germs that can lead to serious infections. Using daily disposable contacts instead of monthlies can also lower risk for infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001d3b6p8u341a0u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If doing water-based activities without wearing contact lenses isn’t safe for you, you can try glasses or prescription goggles. But the concern may also be a good reason to discuss vision correction surgery with your doctor, said Dr. Ashley Brissette, an ophthalmologist at Kelly Vision, a LASIK and cataract surgery center in New York City.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001e3b6pnfj9e6yl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Such procedures include &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25076-smile-eye-surgery" target="_blank"&gt;Smile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/photorefractive-keratectomy-prk-eye-surgery" target="_blank"&gt;PRK&lt;/a&gt; (photorefractive keratectomy) or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21805-lasik-eye-surgery" target="_blank"&gt;LASIK&lt;/a&gt; — all laser-based surgeries — and &lt;a href="https://us.discovericl.com/" target="_blank"&gt;EVO ICL&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for “evolution implantable collamer lens,” Brissette said. Each of those surgeries has its pros and cons, she added, and what works for one person may not for another, depending on one’s eye shape, health and prescription. Brissette underwent LASIK and found it “life-changing,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000t3b6p528xejr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Accurately diagnosing acanthamoeba keratitis begins with taking a careful history of a patient’s recent contact-wearing and lens care habits, Barney said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000u3b6plw2yvljn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are a few tests, including a corneal razor scraping, swabbing or biopsy that can be processed in a lab via culturing or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, which diagnose based on the organism’s genetic information, experts said. A confocal microscopy, an advanced imaging technique, allows professionals to see the amoeba in the cornea once it encapsulates itself as a cyst, Barney said. In this form, the organism can lie dormant for months to years in response to harsh environments, including those created by the human host’s immune response or medications meant to kill the parasite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000v3b6pr2klmz8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, these tests, especially the more advanced ones, aren’t readily available everywhere, and neither are the specialists who administer them, he added. Testing is usually found in university settings or conducted by cornea specialists, and there aren’t many of them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000w3b6pjq3ffbhh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not getting accurately diagnosed until seeing a cornea specialist, as in Sanchez’s and Jamison’s cases, is a common experience for patients with acanthamoeba keratitis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000x3b6pdnftk4r0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re experiencing any concerning&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;symptoms and know you were recently engaging in a high-risk behavior, see a cornea specialist as soon as possible, sources recommended.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000y3b6pghvgehyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Early recognition can really help to improve your outcomes,” Brissette said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47000z3b6pc7vace9f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trying to kill an acanthamoeba while protecting the eye is complicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700103b6p612jfzu4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first-line treatments are anti-amoebic eye drops such as chlorhexidine, propamidine isethionate, hexamidine &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/11206721221124684" target="_blank"&gt;or PHMB&lt;/a&gt;, which is unlicensed in some countries, including the United States, Lorenzo-Morales said. Some of these drops, especially the chlorhexidine, can cause intense pain due to toxic effects on the cornea, adding to the agony the parasite is already causing — hence a need for new treatments, Lorenzo-Morales added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700113b6p34m45fdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The drops are so, so painful but it’s not deep pain — it feels more surface level, like extremely raw and dry,” said Hannah, a 26-year-old woman who has had acanthamoeba keratitis since September 2024. Hannah asked that her last name not be used due to privacy concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5wl327002f3b6ply1g6nfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the treatment wasn’t as bad as the pain from the infection itself, which gave Hannah “the worst migraine of my life,” she said. “I would be on the floor in my bathroom in fetal position, crying and throwing up.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700123b6pt0qt44b6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients are sometimes prescribed two types of medication simultaneously and must apply several drops of each one every half hour or hour, for days to weeks before they can start to reduce    dosage and frequency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700133b6phwqgw918@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s been horrible,” Jamison said of her treatment over the past four months. “You have to get (the eye drops) specially compounded, and they have to be refrigerated at all times because there are no preservatives in them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700143b6pgsee3cag@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hannah keeps a mini fridge by her bed, and an insulated travel     bag on hand, to minimize how much treatment interferes with her sleep, running errands or socializing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700153b6plyo4zj2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes when a patient’s eye has scarring on — or thinning or perforation of — the cornea, a cornea transplant is necessary, said Brissette, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700163b6pufb0zkdb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The scarring in my right eye is right in the center of my vision and covers my whole pupil,” Jamison said. She said her doctor was looking into&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;securing a scleral lens, which is made of breathable plastic: “That’s to hopefully shave down the scarring to make it more smooth, which could help improve my vision.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700173b6pw1qcce3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jamison still has to endure about a year of treatment, and her vision has improved slightly. From her right eye, she mostly just sees white, or shapes or lights when she squints. She has to get her face really close to whatever she’s reading, and she can’t drive.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700183b6p19luefp9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But her vision will never be better than 20/40 unless she gets a cornea transplant, she added. That isn’t an immediate solution — a bit of the patient’s own cornea is still required for a transplant. And there is a risk of the parasites becoming dormant for years before reactivating and destroying a new cornea. So, doctors must first give a patient’s eye at least several months without treatment to ensure sufficient healing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu4700193b6p9dfhueik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sanchez had a cornea transplant in October, about 2 ½ years after contracting acanthamoeba keratitis. She then developed a cataract that was removed this October. “So far, 20/20 vision is where I’m at right now,” she said. “I feel very, very blessed that this is my outcome.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001a3b6p1ezada4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hannah has largely recovered but needs to continue treatment for a couple of months, and her vision in one eye is much blurrier than that of the other, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001f3b6pzvlovv3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people being treated for acanthamoeba keratitis, Sanchez’s “biggest advice is that they trust their doctors and to be patient and not compare their journey with everybody else’s journey.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001g3b6pfzxjcubb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was angry at the fact that my doctors didn’t want to go the fast route and do the transplant sooner, do the cataract surgery sooner,” Sanchez said. “But I’m glad that I trusted them, because had I not, I don’t think that 20/20 vision would have been my outcome, even though it came to me three years later.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001h3b6pe3syqcs6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hannah and Sanchez also recommended joining an online support group, which can be helpful emotionally but also practically. Members of their groups have suggested doctors to help expedite diagnosis and treatment plans or advised ways to cope with the effects of the condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk5vtu47001i3b6pufyplhkh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I know it’s tough, but hang in there. It’s going to get better,” Hannah said, though what’s “better” varies for every patient.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUBA has been overwhelmed by a disease known as “the virus” – leaving hospitals on the verge of collapse as the Communist regime faces accusations of a cover-up. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High fevers, red spots, peeling skin, swollen joints, vomiting and diarrhoea are among symptoms crippling the island’s population – but Cubans have no idea what they are suffering from. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week the Canadian government announced health screenings and quarantine of up to seven days for those coming back from the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in December, Spain told its citizens to stay away from Cuba due to a “serious epidemic”. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Known just as “the virus” to many, reports suggest one third of the &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15732905/trump-warns-communist-cuba-ready-fall-after-maduro-capture/"&gt;Cuba’s population&lt;/a&gt; has been infected – and the British Medical Journal described the “surge” as the country’s most serious crisis in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cuba reported 52 deaths from the virus as of December 17, most of which were children, and officials recently reported more than 38,000 suspected cases of the diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many Cubans say the true numbers are far higher than the state will admit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manuel Cuesta Morúa, a prominent &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/human-rights/"&gt;human rights&lt;/a&gt; activist in &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15578321/maduro-sleeping-beds-cuban-henchmen-trump-war/"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, said the outbreak started in Matanzas about five months ago where sudden deaths began to occur.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, he said, the government hid the figures by issuing death certificates that &lt;span id="d4a5aa9f-be3a-4b34-8e8c-4e972b98405b" class="suggested-link"&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt; to mention the virus. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He told The Sun: “These deaths were never officially recognised as resulting from the virus and were instead presented as ‘natural causes’.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“It was in the provincial &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/hospital/"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt; of Matanzas that a nurse, later expelled from her job and silenced, raised the alarm about the unusually high number of deaths being recorded.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15701457/airport-passengers-exposed-worlds-most-infectious-disease/"&gt;virus spread&lt;/a&gt;, the regime stayed silent. &lt;/p&gt;



		
						
						
		



&lt;p&gt;By late October, health officials said there had been 13,000 new fever cases across the country in a week. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In areas like Camagüey and Holguín, cemeteries have reportedly been overwhelmed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Three months after the disease spread across the island, the &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15600615/donald-trump-expands-us-travel-ban-kristi-noem/"&gt;Cuban government&lt;/a&gt; recognised the crisis as an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the regime still refused to declare a national &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; emergency. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disease has been called a type of “combined arbovirus” – where people are infected with multiple viruses at the same time and it becomes difficult to diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s thought to include dengue, Oropouche and Chikungunya, as well as other infectious respiratory viruses such as H1N influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and Covid-19. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dengue causes fever, severe headache, pain or pressure behind the eyes and rashes – and, in more severe cases, shock, difficulty breathing, severe bleeding and serious organ complications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya, a osquito-borne infection, presents with fever and intense, debilitating joint pain that can persist for months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuban officials insist these are common diseases for the islanders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They are neither new, nor are they rare or unknown,” Public Health Minister José Ángel Portal Miranda said in October. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He then dismissed speculation about a cover-up, claiming: “No one can hide an epidemic or the dead.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dengue has been endemic in Cuba for two decades and it is common for several thousand infections to be recorded each year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Chikungunya had barely been detected previously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the capital city of &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15381791/cuba-russia-troops-recruit-trick-putin-war/"&gt;Havana&lt;/a&gt;, a tourist hotspot, Chikungunya infections have become common.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many tourists arrive from southern &lt;a href="https://www.vax-before-travel.com/destination/florida"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;, especially Miami.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Florida Department of Health confirmed 149 cases of Chikungunya among people who have travelled to Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		
		


&lt;p&gt;According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the situation calls for urgent attention to prevent the virus spreading further.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So far, there has been no indication the epidemic has reached Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Michael Lima, director of rights-focused NGO Democratic Spaces, works closely with Cuban human rights activists on the island.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He told The Sun the epidemic is not an “isolated emergency” but points to more sinister undertones in Cuba that have been “developing for years”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He said: “The country is facing a profound collapse of essential services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Chronic failures of the electrical grid, widespread shortages of food and medicines, the deterioration of sanitation services, breakdowns in garbage collection, environmental sanitation and severe social distress.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A nurse from a clinic in Matanzas told El Pais: “It is not a lie to say that we are dying.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Added to this, Melissa – one of the strongest storms on record in the &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/caribbean/"&gt;Caribbean&lt;/a&gt; – slammed into the island in November 2025, causing major flooding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bins overflowed on the streets as water treatment stalled, creating ideal conditions for mosquitoes – accelerating infections. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With daily &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/blackouts/"&gt;blackouts&lt;/a&gt;, Cuba lacks the fuel to guarantee fumigation whilst insecticides are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It comes as &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/37816260/trump-warns-communist-cuba-ready-fall-after-maduro-capture/" rel=""&gt;Donald Trump issued a stark warning to the Latin American state that Cuba is “ready to fall” without military action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cuba is experiencing its highest levels of repression in decades, according to Amnesty International. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Independent NGOs are not allowed to operate &lt;span id="77604cb9-86cc-4334-a6ae-30020e549f99" class="suggested-link"&gt;freely&lt;/span&gt;, Lima said, and the free press are stifled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He added: “In this context, there is no transparency, no accountability, and no mechanism for early warning or independent oversight—conditions that are particularly dangerous in a public health emergency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This crisis is not accidental.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure id="attachment_15739628" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patients treated in Carlos Manuel de Céspedes Hospital&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Facebook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_15716210" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Men work through mounds of rubbish littering the streets in Cuba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure id="attachment_15739634" class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-caption alignnone aligncenter"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cuba reported 52 deaths from the virus as of 17 December&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Credit: Facebook/Yonimiler del Río Polo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In a country with a collapsed health system, 70,000 workers in the sector have quit and more than 30,000 doctors have emigrated in the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile hospitals have closed, including the Aballí Children’s Hospital in Arroyo Naranjo, and others have been left overcrowded with patients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Manuel said: “Authorities waited months before publicly acknowledging the scale of the chikungunya outbreak and initially downplayed its severity, leaving citizens to rely on &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/social-media/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt; and independent outlets for information. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Even after recognising the epidemic, official updates have remained opaque, offering limited data on hospitalisations, regional spread, or deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has led many Cubans to accuse the regime of a cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October, the Cuban intellectual Alina Bárbara López posted on &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/topic/facebook/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; that authorities were “manipulating” the “extremely serious situation” in Matanzas, the city where she lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She said: “The order to deny the deceased of ‘arbovirosis’ is given.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have a hungry, ageing, stressed population, without medication for a long time to treat their chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While the epidemic became stronger town by town, they have hardly sold paracetamol or rehydrating salts in pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Such a scenario makes possible deaths that would not have happened at any other time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If, as the authorities say, the number of dead has not grown, how can it be explained that at the Faustino Perez provincial hospital a ‘bottling’ occurred in the morgue last weekend because they took time to bring the coffins because the people who put them were also sick. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Is it common for so many people to pass away on a weekend?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Sun has approached the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment.&lt;/p&gt;


		&lt;div class="article-boxout"&gt;
			&lt;p class="article-boxout__header theme__background-color"&gt;
				&lt;h3 class="article-boxout__headline"&gt;What is ‘combined arbovirus’?&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div class="article-boxout__content theme__background-color-rgba-20"&gt;
				
									&lt;p class="article-boxout__content__intro"&gt;
						COMBINED arbovirus is not a single disease, but a category of infections that share similar traits, symptoms, and methods of transmission.					&lt;/p&gt;
				
				&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term describes a patient’s condition that fits the profile of an insect-borne viral infection before a specific virus has been officially identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most arboviral illnesses follow a standard “incubation” period. After being bitten by an infected mosquito or tick, symptoms usually appear within 3 to 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors treat these as a “combined” group because they are clinically indistinguishable&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arboviral illnesses typically present in one of three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Systemic/Febrile (Most Common):&lt;/strong&gt; A sudden flu-like illness.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High fever and chills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe headache (often behind the eyes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle aches (myalgia) and joint pain (arthralgia).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skin rash and fatigue that can last for weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroinvasive (Most Serious):&lt;/strong&gt; The virus crosses into the central nervous system.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meningitis:&lt;/strong&gt; Stiff neck, fever, and light sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encephalitis:&lt;/strong&gt; Confusion, altered mental state, seizures, or tremors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paralysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Sudden weakness in limbs, similar to polio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemorrhagic (Specific Viruses):&lt;/strong&gt; Seen in diseases like Dengue or Yellow Fever.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unexplained bruising, bleeding gums, or internal bleeding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

From cleaning routines to hygiene, and even decorating a living space, these are the things that actually make a difference in our general well-being. That’s part of the reason why small details and mundane habits can also often be “red flags” for how someone’s feeling internally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if it’s clutter or unopened mail, if you notice these details in someone’s home, they’re probably struggling emotionally. They might seem like unimportant things to someone who feels happy and emotionally regulated, but they’re more influential and telling to someone with a lot going on inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If you notice these 11 details in someone’s home, they’re probably struggling emotionally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

That’s why it’s common for people struggling with chronic stress or depression to lean on comfort shows on a regular basis — they know what to expect and can unwind without considering uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you notice these details, like stacks of the same movies on their TV stand, in someone’s home, they’re probably struggling emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/if-you-watch-same-tv-show-over-and-over-again-it-probably-means-these-things-about-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Watch The Same TV Show Over And Over Again, It Probably Means These 11 Things About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

I’ve been through surgery and radiation treatments. According to the oncologists, I should now consider myself a “survivor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MBZUCJH6JREPXE7YVPLZVKNXSI"&gt;Since I have scars, I’m taking medication for the next 10 years that has potentially really bad side effects, and the chance of reoccurrence is a definite possibility, I don’t feel like a “survivor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SQUYB6RWXNDPTMV2BZITH7EJII"&gt;I readily admit that I’m depressed. I maintain that this is a perfectly reasonable reaction to something bad that has upended and changed my whole life for the foreseeable future. I’m not suicidal, and although some mornings are hard, I get up every day, shower, brush my hair and teeth and maintain my usual schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XUHIXRLPBNEPHOKA5J3ERPWUEU"&gt;The worst thing to me about cancer is that I can’t talk to anyone because I’ve gone from an actual person with thoughts and interests to people only wanting to know about the cancer. It’s all anyone asks about. That being the case, I tried to talk to people about how I feel, but the word “depressed” freaks people out more than “cancer.” Now I just say I’m fine or OK to make others feel comfortable, which applies to my doctors as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JXAJRIO2OFGBBBU3GHTGJXJSWM"&gt;I don’t need medication, and I tried online and in-person group discussions a few times, and they aren’t for me. I’ve noticed the same thing with people who lose a loved one or have something else bad happen -- they aren’t allowed to be depressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="S7C3CERC5RE3VEHQS7N6ENPKIQ"&gt;When did it become shameful and something that needs to be fixed when people have a true human emotion to events? Sad things should understandably make us sad -- and maybe depressed?

What is troubling is feeling you have to hide it -- especially from your doctors, who need the full picture, whether it’s pretty or not. You’re allowed to say, “I’m getting through it, but it’s still hard,” and you deserve people in your corner who can hear that without panicking or minimizing it, no matter how uncomfortable it may make them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SRAXQVTSCZA7PMRSEMOM5OH2YI"&gt;Healing doesn’t happen overnight.

There was a feeding tube snaking down one of my nostrils, there were IV’s in both my arms, and a catheter was running from the lower part of my body. The breathing tube that had painfully gagged me during fleeting moments of half-consciousness was mercifully gone. But I couldn’t move my hands and feet, which was disturbing. They were covered in bandages so I just assumed the hospital staff had wrapped the bandages way too tight. Not so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A doctor came and told me I had contracted meningococcal disease, a form of bacterial meningitis that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2014/02/16/277030414/worth-the-pain-a-life-transformed-overnight-by-meningitis" rel&gt;transformed me overnight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a perfectly healthy 22-year-old college student, working at the school newspaper and playing just about every intramural sport, to a comatose ICU patient, fighting for my life on a ventilator. The infection, which I may have gotten just from sharing a drink with someone, had ravaged my bloodstream. Heavy doses of antibiotics eventually killed the bacteria and after three weeks the hospital staff had been able to stabilize my internal organs. But the blood flow to my extremities had not fully returned, and never would.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have tissue damage equal to third-degree burns over 30 percent of your body,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the staff removed the bandages I saw what that meant: My arms and legs had turned pitch black, and my fingers and toes were dried up, lifeless claws. My limbs were rotting while still attached to me. My initial response to this was just straight-up denial. I couldn’t process what I was seeing or deal with it emotionally, so at first I just didn’t even try. Those weren’t my arms and legs. And even if they were, they were going to come back and be fine, no matter what those doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But during the following three months in the hospital’s burn and wound unit, things became too real to deny. First there was “debridement,” a process wherein doctors, nurses, and wound techs sliced off layer after layer of dead tissue, searching for something that would bleed, in an effort to save as much of my limbs as possible. I was awake for that, and had nightmares about it for years afterwards. Then multiple skin-grafting procedures, in which a plastic surgeon took the top layer of skin from my thighs and stapled it over debrided areas that were so big they wouldn’t scar over on their own. Then surgeries to amputate my fingers and toes because hospital staff had debrided down to the bones and tendons and nothing was left alive; only my right thumb was spared. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some photos of what’s described here—graphic patient images—appear below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, denial gave way to the other stages of grief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger: “Why did this happen to me? I don’t deserve this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bargaining: “God, if you give me back one of my hands, just &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, then I’ll spend the rest of my life feeding poor kids in Africa.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression: Laying in bed, bawling my eyes out, thinking, “How can I go on?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceptance: “My old life isn’t coming back, as much as I want it to. I have to figure out how to make something of this new life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was one of the lucky ones. Meningococcal disease kills 10 to 15 percent of people who get it—often within twenty-four hours of their first symptoms. Another 20 percent suffer permanent damage, including amputations like mine, but also brain damage, hearing loss, or vision loss. Multiple doctors have told me it’s one of the illnesses they fear most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But vaccines help. After a broad-based vaccine that prevents meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y was added to the CDC schedule in 2005, the number of cases each year &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7372499/" rel&gt;declined precipitously&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, going from thousands to hundreds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So it’s baffling that Donald Trump, RFK Jr., and their hand-picked vaccine advisers recently decided it’s no longer necessary to protect children from this highly preventable disease and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2026/01/07/cdc-vaccine-recommendations-schedule-revisions/" rel&gt;sidestepped the usual process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to take it, and other vaccines, off the CDC schedule.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For someone like me who has spent the last twenty years trying to explain the dangers of meningitis and convince people to protect themselves through vaccination, their decision to unilaterally remove the meningitis shot from the CDC’s recommended schedule was mind-boggling, dispiriting, and infuriating. It also may be against the law. As a writer with the Association of Health Care Journalists &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2026/01/covering-the-big-changes-in-the-cdcs-recommended-childhood-vaccine-schedule/" rel&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; this week, the Trump administration “has not provided a scientifically or legally sound explanation for the change.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meningitis is a rare disease, but for the last few years &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/meningitis/cdc-data-show-sharp-rise-rates-meningococcal-disease" rel&gt;rates have been rising&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and no one really knows why. Now is not the time to discourage vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;KNOWING HOW HELPFUL A VACCINE CAN BE, I have spent twenty years testifying in state legislatures to add meningitis to the list of shots required for school attendance. When a new vaccine was approved in 2015 for serogroup B meningitis, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/meetingcoverage/acip/52292" rel&gt;I testified before the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with a group of other advocates to try and get the CDC to recommend it for all adolescents as well. They declined, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/adult-non-flu-vaccines/acip-endorses-individual-choice-meningitis-b-vaccine" rel&gt;citing a lack of long-term data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This is how I knew that statements RFK Jr. and FDA commissioner Marty Makary made last year about previous versions of ACIP and CDC being “rubber stamps” for vaccines were false—I was there in 2015 and they didn’t give me the stamp I was looking for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The meningitis vaccine will still be available based on “shared clinical decision-making,” but the general public &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/confusion-surrounds-cdc-s-shared-clinical-decision-making-paradigm-childhood" rel&gt;doesn’t really know what that means&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It causes confusion for parents already exhausted from having to make a thousand decisions a day, and results in lower vaccination rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’ve already seen proof of that with meningitis vaccines. About &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/vaccines/types.html" rel&gt;90 percent of American adolescents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; currently get at least one dose of the MenACWY vaccine—the one RFK Jr. and company just removed from the CDC schedule. The MenB vaccine prevents &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;the exact same disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but because it’s not on the universally recommended schedule, only about 37 percent of adolescents get it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m hopeful that uptake of the MenACWY shot won’t drop that low. Thankfully, it will remain on most states’ required lists, at least for a while, and a majority of Americans understand that the current administration has no credibility when it comes to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s also encouraging to see some prominent Republicans already pushing back on the changes, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician from Louisiana, whose vote helped get RFK Jr. confirmed as HHS secretary. Cassidy rightly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5673618-vaccine-schedule-reduction-criticized-cassidy/" rel&gt;stated that the new vaccine guidelines are not based on scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and would make America sicker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there has been a concerning lack of leadership from others who should know better, including &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/RogerMarshallMD/posts/todays-updated-cdc-childhood-vaccine-schedule-is-a-smart-step-toward-restoring-t/1409257663898664/" rel&gt;a glowing statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; about the changes from Sen. Roger Marshall, a physician and a Republican from Kansas, the state where I lived when meningitis nearly killed me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When vaccines got sucked into the vortex of COVID-19 partisan polarization it caused &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/once-covid-vaccines-were-introduced-more-republicans-died-than-democrats" rel&gt;Republicans to become more likely to die of COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; than Democrats. I fear the same will happen with meningitis—that kids will die or become disabled for no reason except for the political party their parents identify with. That’s appalling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I continue to struggle with the effects of meningococcal disease to this day. I recently had my leg amputated below the knee because the toeless stump of my right foot had deteriorated in the last few years, causing chronic pain that made it hard to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is the time for serious, organized opposition to these drastic vaccine changes. Anti-vaccine activists will inevitably try to align state laws with these new CDC guidelines. That’s unthinkable. No one should have to go through an experience like mine—not when there is a safe, simple shot that can prevent it. I hope our country can step back from this madness before too much irreversible damage is done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/my-life-shows-the-horror-of-rfk-jr-vaccine-guidelines-acip-cdc-hhs?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/my-life-shows-the-horror-of-rfk-jr-vaccine-guidelines-acip-cdc-hhs?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery" class="gallery-Phxj1j"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-gap-8 pc-reset"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="imageCaption-iHC8xR"&gt;(Photos courtesy of the author)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andy Marso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; was a member of the guideline development group for the World Health Organization’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/defeating-meningitis-by-2030" rel&gt;Defeating Meningitis by 2030&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; roadmap.

Most treatment strategies focus on blocking a frequently mutated cancer gene known as KRAS. While this approach can work in some cases, many PDAC tumors eventually evade these therapies. Researchers believe that combining treatments that hit additional molecular targets could someday help doctors overcome this resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, researchers in the lab of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Professor Adrian Krainer identified a protein called SRSF1 as an early trigger of PDAC tumor formation. By taking a deeper look at data from that study, a new team led by former CSHL graduate student Alexander Kral discovered that SRSF1 is not acting on its own. Instead, it operates as part of a three-part molecular system that drives the cancer to become more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our theory was that some of the changes caused by increased levels of SRSF1 were playing a role in the accelerated tumor growth we were seeing," Kral explains. "We homed in on a molecule we thought could be an important driver of this called Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We found it's part of a complex regulatory circuit that includes not only AURKA and SRSF1, but another key oncogene called MYC."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How a Self-Reinforcing Cancer Circuit Works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this system, SRSF1 controls AURKA by altering how its genetic instructions are processed through a mechanism known as alternative splicing. This leads to higher levels of AURKA, which then helps stabilize and protect the MYC protein. MYC, in turn, boosts production of SRSF1, setting the entire process in motion again and allowing the cancer-promoting loop to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Bits and pieces of this circuit were known previously, but we didn't have the full picture until now," Krainer says. "Once we figured out alternative splicing of AURKA was involved, we could start looking into ways to disrupt it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collapsing the Circuit With a Single Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To interfere with this process, the team created an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to alter how AURKA is spliced. ASOs are short synthetic molecules that the Krainer lab has extensive experience developing. The group previously created Spinraza, the first-ever FDA-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on their earlier findings, the researchers expected the new ASO to block AURKA splicing. Instead, in pancreatic cancer cells, the effect was far more dramatic. The treatment caused the entire cancer-driving circuit to fall apart. Tumor cells lost viability and activated apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like killing three birds with one stone," Krainer explains. "SRSF1, AURKA, and MYC are all oncogenes contributing to PDAC progression. Just by targeting AURKA splicing with our ASO, we see the loss of these other two molecules as well."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Toward Future Cancer Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Krainer lab is continuing to improve the ASO, although any potential use in patients remains far in the future. Krainer emphasizes that major medical advances often begin with this kind of foundational research. Spinraza followed a similar path before going on to save thousands of lives. With further refinement, this work could one day contribute to a new and effective treatment for pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turmeric may help reduce inflammation and joint pain, and it may support heart and gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Safe intake of turmeric supplements is considered up to 8 g, but long-term effects are unknown.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Possible side effects include nausea, diarrhea, liver injury and medication interactions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re exploring ways to spice up your wellness routine, chances are turmeric supplements have caught your attention. Praised for their ability to stamp out inflammation, these golden capsules have become popular among those seeking natural ways to support their health. Turmeric supplements are often formulated with enhanced absorption and a higher concentration of potent compounds than what you’d find in the spice you’d typically use in cooking. But do they really live up to their claims?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We spoke with registered dietitians to break down the benefits, potential risks and what you should know before adding turmeric supplements to your daily regimen.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289544/why-turmeric-is-so-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Turmeric&lt;/a&gt; is a golden-yellow spice that comes from the root of the &lt;em&gt;Curcuma longa &lt;/em&gt;plant, native to Southeast Asia. With its distinctively warm and earthy flavor, turmeric has been used as a culinary spice and traditional medicine for thousands of years.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s particularly valued for its beneficial compounds. Most notably, turmeric contains active compounds called curcuminoids that have been isolated and studied for their positive effects on the body, says &lt;a href="https://www.meghanpendleton.com/about-me-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meghan Pendleton, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian. Within the class of curcuminoids, curcumin is commonly promoted as a beneficial supplement for a myriad of health conditions, as outlined below.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Lower Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While short-term inflammation is a natural and necessary part of the body’s healing process, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prolonged inflammation&lt;/a&gt; (aka chronic inflammation) can contribute to the onset of chronic conditions. Among natural remedies, turmeric is widely recognized for its ability to combat inflammation. “Its active compound, curcumin, is the driving force behind its anti-inflammatory effects,” says &lt;a href="https://www.anywherenutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Emily Niswanger, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a functional registered dietitian. Curcumin supplements have been shown to reduce inflammation by suppressing the pathways that lead to an inflammatory response, Niswanger explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She adds that curcumin also functions as an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2051586/best-antioxidant-rich-foods/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;antioxidant&lt;/a&gt;, helping to clear free radicals from the body that damage healthy cells and tissues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Reduce Joint Pain &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turmeric’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties have also been shown to alleviate joint pain. “Curcumin can reduce joint pain and stiffness by inhibiting inflammatory pathways, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are often overactive in arthritis,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionrewired.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Erin Kenney, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian. She emphasizes that studies have shown that turmeric supplementation can be as effective as some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in relieving osteoarthritis symptoms without the associated side effects, such as indigestion, constipation, drowsiness and dizziness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, more high-quality research is needed to confirm its effectiveness and determine the optimal dosage for relieving joint pain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The curcumin in this golden spice may even boost your heart health. “Curcumin helps reduce systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and LDL cholesterol oxidation, all of which contribute to heart disease,” says Kenney.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She highlights that it also improves endothelial function, which supports healthy blood vessel function and circulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some research suggests that turmeric supplements may help lower systolic blood pressure when taken for more than 12 weeks. However, no impact has been observed for diastolic blood pressure, says Niswanger.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As a reference, systolic blood pressure is the upper number in your blood pressure measurement, whereas diastolic blood pressure is the lower number.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While these findings are encouraging, additional research is needed to fully understand the long-term impact of turmeric supplements on heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The benefits of turmeric supplements may also extend to the gut. “Due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, curcumin can help reduce inflammation in the gut, potentially benefiting conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),” says Kenney.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She explains that curcumin may also promote a balanced gut microbiome by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria and reducing harmful ones.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, she notes that it may support bile production, which is required for fat digestion and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;overall digestive health&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pendleton says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8044818/what-happens-to-your-brain-as-you-age/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protecting the brain&lt;/a&gt; from inflammation and oxidative damage is crucial for maintaining cognitive function, as both are closely linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Curcumin has shown potential in several studies for reducing these harmful processes and improving cognitive outcomes in people with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, Pendleton highlights that, while these results are promising, more long-term human studies are needed to fully assess turmeric’s impact on chronic neurological conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is generally safe at doses up to 8 grams, it does come with risks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Kenney notes that some individuals may experience common gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, diarrhea and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291129/sneaky-causes-of-belly-bloat-and-how-to-prevent-them/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bloating&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, turmeric supplements may interfere with iron absorption, particularly affecting those with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7676216/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-iron-deficiency/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;iron-deficiency anemia&lt;/a&gt;, explains Pendleton.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rare but serious side effects, such as liver injury, have been reported in case studies involving high-potency curcumin supplements, says Niswanger. Fortunately, symptoms of liver toxicity typically resolve once supplementation is discontinued.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Kidney issues, including an increased risk of kidney stones, have also been linked to turmeric supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The lack of standardized formulations in turmeric supplements raises concerns about quality and safety. Pendleton says that without chemical analysis of every batch, it’s difficult to know the precise composition of the product you’re taking. She adds that contamination with heavy metals, stemming from the soil in which turmeric is grown, is another potential risk due to inadequate safety testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While some people may benefit from taking turmeric supplements, others may need to avoid them. “Caution is advised for individuals with gallbladder issues, bleeding disorders, kidney stones, or hormone-sensitive conditions,” says Kenney. Pregnant and breastfeeding individuals should avoid high-dose turmeric supplements, as their safety has not been adequately studied in these groups. In addition, people taking certain medications such as blood thinners, antidiabetics, antacids, immunosuppressants and hormone therapies should consult a health care provider before supplementing with turmeric due to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/turmeric-and-medication-interactions-8430624" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potential adverse interactions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;choosing the ideal turmeric supplemen&lt;/a&gt;t, Niswanger recommends sourcing it from a reputable company that performs independent verification. This ensures the supplement is free from high contaminants and contains the ingredients and dosages stated on the label.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For better absorption and enhanced effectiveness, Kenney suggests choosing a turmeric supplement that contains black pepper extract (piperine)—unless contraindicated. She also recommends taking it with a meal that contains healthy fats to further boost absorption and maximize its benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turmeric supplements offer a convenient and concentrated way to tap into the potential benefits of curcumin, particularly in reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. While research is promising for conditions like joint pain, heart disease, IBS and Alzheimer’s, more research is needed to confirm its effectiveness. As with any supplement, it’s important to consult a health care provider to discuss your unique medical history, potential side effects and medication interactions associated with taking turmeric. “Turmeric is much safer and more delicious eaten as a whole spice versus a highly concentrated supplement form,” says Pendleton. However, if you do choose to take a turmeric supplement, it’s important to ensure it fits into a well-balanced dietary regimen.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who take medications like blood thinners, antidiabetics, antacids, immunosuppressants and hormone therapies should avoid taking a turmeric supplement. Combining turmeric with these medications can interfere with their effectiveness or cause adverse side effects. Therefore, it’s always best to consult your health care provider and err on the side of caution when taking herbal and conventional medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

LDL is commonly known as the "bad" cholesterol responsible for transporting cholesterol, fats and proteins throughout the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;In contrast, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), often called "good" cholesterol, works to carry excess cholesterol from bodily tissues back to the liver for disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr Naveed Asif, a GP at &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.thelondongeneralpractice.com/" target="_self" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" tabindex="0"&gt;The London General Practice&lt;/a&gt;, described cholesterol as a "waxy, fat-like material present in every cell of the body" that is "essential for the production of hormones, vitamin D, and compounds that aid in digestion". Nevertheless, excessive amounts of "bad" cholesterol can lead to plaque building up in the arteries and trigger various health complications, including atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr Asif added: "Elevated cholesterol levels can greatly heighten the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular conditions. An excessive buildup of LDL cholesterol in the arteries can cause atherosclerosis, a condition characterised by the hardening and narrowing of the arteries, which restricts blood flow. This can lead to severe health problems, such as heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr John Field, associate clinical director at &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.bupa.co.uk/" target="_self" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" tabindex="0"&gt;Bupa Health Clinics&lt;/a&gt;, concurred that raised levels of particular cholesterol types can "increase your risk of cardiovascular disease - for example, heart disease and stroke". He added: "This is because one type of cholesterol can cause fatty deposits to build up inside your arteries. Over time, these can make your arteries narrower and narrower, which restricts the flow of blood to organs such as your heart. This can affect other parts of your body too, including your arms and legs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Regular exercise, keeping to a healthy weight, cutting back on alcohol and stopping smoking can all contribute to reducing high cholesterol levels, though adjusting your diet is frequently the simplest initial step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr Saira Bano, a seasoned &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/nhs" target="" aria-label="" rel="follow" tabindex="0"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; and private GP with more than 10 years of clinical experience, observed that medical professionals widely acknowledge that foods high in soluble fibre and smart fat substitutions assist in lowering LDL cholesterol levels. Nevertheless, she pointed out, "oats and barley tend to top the list".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;She explained: "Oats and barley tend to top the list because their beta-glucan fibre lowers LDL, with about 3g per day from porridge or oat bran being a realistic target. Beans, lentils, and chickpeas most days, along with fruit and vegetables rich in soluble fibre such as apples, berries, citrus, aubergine, and okra, help bind cholesterol in the gut and support bile acid excretion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;"A small daily handful of nuts, roughly 30g of almonds, walnuts, or pistachios, plus soya foods like tofu, edamame, and soya milk or yoghurt a few times a week, can support LDL reduction while adding heart-healthy fats and plant protein. Seeds and fibre supplements also have a role: one to two tablespoons of ground flax or chia, or around 10g of psyllium, can meaningfully lift soluble fibre intake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image-group"&gt;&lt;button class="SlideViewerButton_slide-viewer-button__BDJoG" aria-label="Open image viewer" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-controls="image-lightbox"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX false" data-testid="imageembed-10746742" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10746742" data-tmdatatrack-type="image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageCaption_caption__j7HRu" data-testid="image-caption"&gt;&lt;p aria-label="It can be hard knowing what to eat to lower cholesterol" class="ImageCaption_caption-title__ccyQU" data-testid="caption-title"&gt;It can be hard knowing what to eat to lower cholesterol&lt;cite aria-label="Image: ollo via Getty Images" class="ImageCaption_caption-credit__wlx1W" data-testid="caption-credit"&gt;(Image: ollo via Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Numerous health professionals advocate for the use of plant sterol or stanol-enriched products (such as Benecol) spreads or yoghurts, consumed at 1.5-2g daily. These can reduce LDL cholesterol by approximately 7-10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Additionally, replacing butter or ghee with olive or rapeseed oil when cooking is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr Adam Staten, resident doctor at &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://onedaytests.com/" target="_self" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" tabindex="0"&gt;One Day Tests&lt;/a&gt;, the UK's premier next-day blood results clinic, highlighted that the "traditional advice" for managing cholesterol centres on the Mediterranean Diet. This eating pattern emphasises abundant fruit and vegetables, limited red meat, moderate amounts of chicken and oily fish, and the substitution of butter or ghee with olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;He further suggested incorporating nuts and soluble fibre sources such as oats, lentils, beans and barley into one's diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Research cited by the expert revealed that individuals consuming nuts five or more times weekly experienced a 20% reduction in their risk of ischaemic heart disease compared to those who rarely ate nuts. Crucially, the nuts should preferably be consumed raw and unsalted for maximum benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Adding to the discussion, a biomedical scientist with expertise in haematology, immunology and diagnostics, Tobias Mapulanga, emphasised the importance of soluble fibre in managing cholesterol levels. He stated: "Food sources of soluble fibre like beans, lentils, oats and barley, help improve cholesterol by reducing the absorption of cholesterol in the gut and should also be eaten regularly by anybody looking to lower cholesterol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Mapulanga further recommended foods that replace saturated fats with unsaturated ones for lowering LDL cholesterol. He explained: "Regular oats or barley for beta-glucan, along with beans, lentils, chickpeas, and fruits such as apples, pears, and citrus for pectin, help reduce cholesterol absorption in the gut and lower LDL. A small handful of nuts on most days, soy foods like tofu or soy milk, and seeds, including flax and chia, add extra fibre and plant sterols while supporting a healthier lipid profile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;He also suggested dietary changes for cooking and dressings, advising: "For cooking and dressings, it helps to swap butter, ghee, and coconut oil for olive or rapeseed oil to reduce saturated fat and increase monounsaturated fats, and to include oily fish a couple of times a week for overall cardiometabolic benefit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;For those seeking an additional boost, Mapulanga mentioned sterol- or stanol-enriched spreads and yoghurts, stating: "If you want an added push, sterol- or stanol-enriched spreads and yoghurts providing around 1.5-2g per day can further lower LDL when used alongside these foods, though they are not intended for children or during pregnancy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr Richard Allison, a nutritionist at &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.herbalife.com/en-gb" target="_self" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" tabindex="0"&gt;Herbalife&lt;/a&gt;, has recommended adopting a heart-healthy diet rich in soluble fibre from sources such as oats, beans and fruits to maintain balanced cholesterol levels. He also advocates for the inclusion of unsaturated fats found in avocados, nuts and olive oil, as well as omega-3s from oily fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;In addition to dietary changes, Dr Allison emphasises the importance of regular physical activity, suggesting at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week to help raise HDL (good cholesterol) and lower LDL (bad cholesterol). He advises: "Reduce saturated fats (found in red meat, full-fat dairy, and processed foods) to below 20-30g daily, replacing them with unsaturated fats. Secondly, eat at least five portions of fruits and vegetables daily, whole grains, and foods high in soluble fibre (e.g. porridge, lentils) to lower LDL by 5-10%. And lastly, include oily fish twice weekly for omega-3s, and limit added sugars and salt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image-group"&gt;&lt;button class="SlideViewerButton_slide-viewer-button__BDJoG" aria-label="Open image viewer" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-controls="image-lightbox"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX false" data-testid="imageembed-10746739" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="10746739" data-tmdatatrack-type="image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageCaption_caption__j7HRu" data-testid="image-caption"&gt;&lt;p aria-label="Oats were universally recommended by all the experts" class="ImageCaption_caption-title__ccyQU" data-testid="caption-title"&gt;Oats were universally recommended by all the experts&lt;cite aria-label="Image: 4nadia via Getty Images" class="ImageCaption_caption-credit__wlx1W" data-testid="caption-credit"&gt;(Image: 4nadia via Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;He further recommends: "Aim for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (e.g. brisk walking, cycling) plus strength training twice weekly.

She explained: "Consuming foods which are high in fibre can help to lower cholesterol, as it binds to cholesterol in the gut and stops it being absorbed into the body. Soluble fibre, which draws water into the gut, is best for this. It's found in oats, barley, legumes (beans, lentils, peas and soybeans), chia seeds and fruits, especially apples and berries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;"Oats and barley contain a type of soluble fibre called beta-glucans, with a bowl of porridge providing around half of the daily recommended amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;"In addition to fibre-rich foods, antioxidants found in berries, leafy green vegetables and brightly coloured vegetables, such as lycopene in tomatoes, support healthy cholesterol levels, reduce inflammation and aid heart health in general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;She further advised incorporating five portions of fruit and vegetables daily, consuming foods abundant in omega-3 fatty acids like oily fish and flaxseed, along with monounsaturated fats present in olive oil, nuts and avocados. She also highlighted nuts as a valuable source of plant sterols, natural compounds that prevent cholesterol absorption into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;NHS GP Dr Dave Nichols, who serves as resident doctor for at-home testing brand &lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://myhealthchecked.com/" target="_self" aria-label="" rel="nofollow" tabindex="0"&gt;MyHealthChecked&lt;/a&gt;, offered five simple suggestions for cholesterol management, emphasising fibre-rich foods such as oats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;He said: "Focus on foods rich in fibre (like oats, legumes, fruits, and vegetables) and healthy fats (like those in nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish). Cut back on saturated fats, trans fats, and processed foods."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;He further advised incorporating regular physical activity—approximately 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days—alongside maintaining a healthy body weight, giving up smoking, and limiting alcohol intake. He also suggested using an at-home cholesterol testing kit to easily track total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph"&gt;Dr Asif stressed the importance of following a heart-healthy eating plan to keep cholesterol levels in check.

LDWF declares emergency after chronic wasting disease detected in Concordia Parish deer
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONCORDIA PARISH - Parts of Pointe Coupee Parish are affected by a declaration of emergency from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries regarding a deer being detected with chronic wasting disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The declaration affects all of Catahoula and Concordia parishes alongside portions of Avoyelles, LaSalle, Pointe Coupee and Rapides parishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The declaration was made after a &lt;span&gt;white-tailed buck in Concordia Parish was confirmed to have Chronic Wasting Disease; the disease is infectious, always fatal and has no treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The areas affected will have restrictions on baiting and feeding, which will become effective on Feb. 1. In addition, deer carcass transport rules are included that prohibit the export of certain deer parts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The full map is available &lt;a href="https://www.wlf.louisiana.gov/assets/Resources/Publications/Commission_Action_Items/DE---Chronic-Wasting-Disease-Control-Areas---RKY.pdf"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That includes 17 reported child deaths, one of whom was in Wisconsin. The CDC is currently classifying this flu season as moderately severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Wisconsin, flu hospitalizations have quadrupled since Dec. 20. Dr. Mary Beth Graham, infectious disease specialist with Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin, said the system's hospitals started to see declines at the end of December. But that could quickly reverse itself, she said, as flu can spike more than once a season. That's what happened last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Statewide, the virus seems to be hospitalizing more children than in past years, Graham said. Residents over 65 make up the largest share of hospitalizations, but she doesn't see that as something particular to the way this virus is acting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;What has changed, she said, is fewer people getting the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;About 30% of Wisconsinites &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/influenza.htm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;have received a flu vaccine this season&lt;/a&gt;, a percentage that has been steadily declining in recent years. Roughly 60% of those 65 and older have gotten it, also the lowest in a few years, and about 22% of 5 to 17-year-olds. The state's target for &lt;strong&gt;widespread protection from the flu is 70%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although this year's vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2026/jan/06/super-flu-subclade-k-influenza-vaccine/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;was formulated before the new variant emerged&lt;/a&gt;, Graham said it's still a good idea to get it, because it offers protection against other strains that often pop up later in the season. She said she also recommends that people with underlying conditions that make them more susceptible to severe flu symptoms keep at-home flu tests on hand so they can quickly determine if they have it and get treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Flu is not a benign disease for people who have underlying comorbidities," she said. "Even someone who's nice and healthy, they can feel horrible from influenza."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Overall flu activity in Wisconsin, which is based on emergency department data, was &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/disease/respiratory-data.htm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;very high, but decreasing&lt;/a&gt; the week ending Jan. 3, which is the latest data available from the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To get vaccinated, residents can check with their doctor, health department, pharmacy or other community clinic. People who do not have health insurance can use programs such as the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/vfc-parent.htm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Vaccines for Children program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/vfa.htm" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Vaccines for Adults program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madeline Heim covers health and the environment for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Contact her at 920-996-7266 or &lt;a href="mailto:mheim@gannett.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;mheim@gannett.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxPY2pXbWRTS0t0NXZBczdhRi0teVIyVzhIQXBGZEdGeU9mdzVHRXk5bS1UcjBtdi12S3c3R0dpeWt0eGtoLUlGMlRTcjY1aWRnSnU4WlBzYWpQaWwxV3hBTDBmd19LaHExazk2OWNaemU5MmE2bTlJa2tFWTZvY2s0UXA0LWhIaGg4OTg3TUZDUDd5NjMyZ1Q3VXJxLWt5SnhVaDBHVlJrbHBEMWZiTDZVRGx5WTduOUxaN0M1QzJ5WXpQQk9VRVM0WF9NRHVuQQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
