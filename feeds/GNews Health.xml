He said that would include stem cells, vitamins, peptides and chelation therapy, which involves removing heavy metals from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If you want to take an experimental drug — you can do that, you ought to be able to do that,” Mr. Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“And of course you’re going to get a lot of charlatans, and you’re going to get people who have bad results,” he added. “And ultimately, you can’t prevent that either way.

This gentle technique significantly improves cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage—a critical function that declines with age and contributes to cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used fluorescent tracers in mice and monkeys to uncover a new drainage pathway connecting facial lymphatics to deep lymph nodes, which remains intact even in older individuals. A handheld device that lightly strokes the skin restored youthful CSF flow in aged animals, opening up exciting potential for wearable treatments that prevent or slow neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Drainage Route:&lt;/strong&gt; Scientists mapped a previously unknown CSF drainage pathway through facial lymphatics to submandibular nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Gentle mechanical stimulation of the face and neck enhanced CSF clearance without drugs or surgery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Proof Vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; Superficial facial lymphatics retain function in aging, making them ideal targets for therapeutic stimulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) have uncovered a non-invasive method to boost the brain’s natural waste drainage system—a discovery that could open new avenues for tackling age-related neurological disorders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in Nature, researchers from the IBS Center for Vascular Research, led by Director KOH Gou Young, along with senior researchers JIN Hokyung, YOON Jin-Hui, and principal researcher HONG Seon Pyo, demonstrated that precisely stimulating the lymphatics under skin on the neck and face can significantly enhance the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—the liquid that cushions the brain and helps remove toxic waste—through lymphatic vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110671"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When applied to aged mice, the device restored CSF clearance to youthful levels, dramatically improving drainage without disrupting natural lymphatic contractions.Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offers a new approach to clearing brain waste using safe, non-invasive mechanical stimulation, rather than relying on drugs or surgical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain produces waste at a high rate compared to other organs, and clearing it efficiently is essential for healthy brain function. This clearance is primarily carried out by CSF, which removes harmful substances such as amyloid-β and tau proteins—key factors in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, as we age, this drainage slows down, contributing to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBS Center for Vascular Research previously published landmark studies in Nature (2019 and 2024) demonstrating that CSF drains to deep cervical lymph nodes via meningeal lymphatic vessels at the base of the skull and the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus. They also showed that age-related degeneration of these lymphatics impairs CSF clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the team found that CSF drainage could be enhanced or suppressed pharmacologically by targeting cervical lymphatic vessels outside the skull. However, clinical applications remained limited because these lymphatics are located too deep in the neck for non-invasive access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research not only completed the map of cerebrospinal fluid drainage pathways that clear brain waste, but also provided a new method to enhance CSF drainage from outside the brain,” stated KOH Gou Young, Center Director and corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect this will serve as a milestone for future research on neurodegenerative diseases including dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, using genetically modified mice and monkeys with fluorescent tracers, the researchers have mapped out a new CSF drainage route from the brain to superficial cervical lymph nodes—via a network of lymphatic vessels in the face, nose, and hard palate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older animals, many of these routes had degenerated—except for the vessels just beneath the facial skin, which retained full functionality despite aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We confirmed that lymphatic vessels beneath facial skin connect to submandibular lymph nodes through various pathways,” explained JIN Hokyung, Senior Researcher and co-first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through these connections, we can regulate the reduced cerebrospinal fluid drainage function seen in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to determine how this newly identified pathway can be applied in actual patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this, the team developed a force-regulated mechanical stimulator—a handheld device that gently presses and strokes the skin in a controlled manner. When applied to aged mice, the device restored CSF clearance to youthful levels, dramatically improving drainage without disrupting natural lymphatic contractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased that we found a safer and more effective method to enhance cerebrospinal fluid drainage from outside the skull,” said YOON Jin-Hui, co-first author and neurovascular physiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are conducting follow-up studies to investigate how this newly identified drainage pathway is altered in various brain disease patients and how this new stimulation method can be applied therapeutically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique could pave the way for wearable or clinical devices that enhance brain waste clearance in older adults or patients with neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now investigating how this drainage system behaves in diseases like Alzheimer’s—and whether mechanical stimulation could serve as a preventive or therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

A canceled effort to develop a bird flu vaccine. An infectious new COVID variant and changing federal guidance about who should get boosted. In recent weeks, drama in D.C. has buried several vaccine-related developments. Todayâ€™s newsletter explains whatâ€™s new and what it means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;Last month, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926 "&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC would no longer recommend that healthy children and healthy pregnant women receive COVID booster shots, altering Biden-era guidance that everyone older than 6 months get boosted annually. The CDC appeared to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;slightly soften Kennedyâ€™s guidance&lt;/a&gt;, saying that healthy kids and pregnant women â€œmayâ€� get boosters if their doctors recommend it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;The administration has tried to narrow the pool of people it says should get boosted. But where some of the changes reflect reasonable readings of the science, others do not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah, a top CDC official during the Biden administration, said experts debate whether younger children should get boosted. When Shah was in government, he recommended it. But many other countries donâ€™t, noting that most young children have a low risk of serious illness. The mRNA technology used in some COVID shots can also have side effects, including a condition called myocarditis that mostly affects boys and young men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But Shah, who previously led Maineâ€™s CDC and is now at Colby College, says the evidence is much less debatable in the case of pregnant women. Not only are boosters safe and effective for them, but getting them protects babies in utero and up to 6 months old &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-booster-safety-science-vs-rfk-jr-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-booster-safety-science-vs-rfk-jr-guidance/"&gt;who canâ€™t get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The way Kennedy made the changes has also troubled experts. Normally, health agencies gather outside advisersâ€™ input before making new recommendations. But Kennedy seems to have acted unilaterally. His announcement, made in a minutelong social media video, &lt;a href="https://wapo.st/4kmgCit" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://wapo.st/4kmgCit"&gt;surprised CDC officials&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;ðŸŽ�&lt;/b&gt;). â€œWhat it suggests is that some of the conclusions are foregone,â€� Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy argues that health experts made mistakes that undermined public trust during the pandemic. Shah acknowledges that, to a point. Some experts, he said, tried to squelch dissenting views or didnâ€™t effectively communicate that scientistsâ€™ understanding of COVID would evolve, causing confusion when public health guidance changed. Other experts overstated &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/11/cdc-exaggerates-outdoor-transmission-rate-covid-19-experts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nypost.com/2021/05/11/cdc-exaggerates-outdoor-transmission-rate-covid-19-experts/ "&gt;the risk of outdoor transmission&lt;/a&gt; or supported extended school closures that caused severe learning loss &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk8.RR9s.7SvgrzaRad7b&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk8.RR9s.7SvgrzaRad7b&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;while doing little to contain infections&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;ðŸŽ�&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the administrationâ€™s approach risks sowing further confusion. Kennedyâ€™s announcement conflicts with an article that two Trump-appointed FDA officials published days earlier, which listed pregnancy as one factor that puts women â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;at high risk for severe COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.â€� The fact that Kennedy â€” who has long spread vaccine misinformation and says he doesnâ€™t â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/nation/rfk-jr-hhs-first-100-days/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/nation/rfk-jr-hhs-first-100-days/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;think people should be taking medical advice from me&lt;/a&gt;â€� â€” made the changes could also corrode trust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;â€œWhat worries me is that when we get into another emergency situation, if trust in federal health authorities has waned, thatâ€™s a problem,â€� Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, COVID keeps evolving. A variant called NB.1.8.1 has recently driven up cases in China and elsewhere. But for now, Shah isnâ€™t hugely concerned. NB.1.8.1 descended from Omicron, a variant that swept the United States in late 2021 and early 2022. So even if cases rise, existing vaccines and antibodies from prior infection will likely help protect against severe illness. The World Health Organization says the new variant â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON572" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;suggests no increased public health risk&lt;/a&gt;â€� so far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;A few months ago, bird flu was spreading rapidly among cows and chickens, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/29/metro/officials-say-widespread-bird-flu-outbreak-is-largest-state-has-seen/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/29/metro/officials-say-widespread-bird-flu-outbreak-is-largest-state-has-seen/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;killing birds and other animals&lt;/a&gt;, and sickening dozens of people. Since then, the outbreak has slowed; the last reported human cases were in February, and only one person has died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;Bird flu may be seasonal, which &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cdc-8857e56c7b91d82613042beaba169a31" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;could explain the ebb&lt;/a&gt;. But another possibility is that cases are going unreported because fewer people are getting tested. In February, the administration &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/trump-fired-bird-flu-hires-00206334" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;fired, and then scrambled to rehire&lt;/a&gt;, officials involved in bird flu testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Given the uncertainty, some experts have faulted the administration for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707"&gt;canceling contracts with Moderna&lt;/a&gt; to develop a bird flu vaccine. The effort aimed to adapt the companyâ€™s versatile mRNA technology, which Kennedy has repeatedly cast doubt on despite overwhelming evidence of safety. (The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-moderna-covid-vaccine-rcna210250" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; a new mRNA COVID booster from Moderna last weekend.) Instead, the administration is funding a project aimed at developing a bird flu vaccine using technology &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/"&gt;similar to seasonal flu shots&lt;/a&gt;, which can take longer to produce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;Cases of the highly contagious virus continue to rise nationwide, but slowly. The largest outbreak, in West Texas, seems to be abating. Three Americans have died this year, all unvaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;A slowing case rate is good news, although many more people could have gotten sick than the official numbers reflect. The measles vaccine is safe, highly effective, and decades old, but Kennedy was slow to full-throatedly recommend it as the outbreak grew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_center"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;ðŸ§© &lt;b&gt;3 Down:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;amp;id=32a060d85a&amp;amp;e=6856f9c7b9" title="https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;amp;id=32a060d85a&amp;amp;e=6856f9c7b9"&gt;Repeat verbatim&lt;/a&gt; | â˜€ï¸� &lt;b&gt;90Â°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/04/metro/heat-humidity-and-hazy-skies-continue-across-boston-and-new-england/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/04/metro/heat-humidity-and-hazy-skies-continue-across-boston-and-new-england/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;Hot, humid, and hazy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

            More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, and the highly contagious virus has put people at risk while they wait in ERs and doctor’s offices — but also at a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/shakira-measles-new-jersey-texas-mmr-25022a0b7c69a23c27b0ccdbf818ee86" target="_blank"&gt;Shakira concert&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey, at a &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles060225.html" target="_blank"&gt;mall&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota, at a &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/02/25/measles-outbreak-exposure-texas-new-braunfels-buc-ees/80309897007/" target="_blank"&gt;Buc-ee’s store in Texas&lt;/a&gt; and in airports and planes in several states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000a3b6m7lgg9e6s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;recently updated travel notice&lt;/a&gt;. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000b3b6mbyn4dfjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a situation that may feel unfamiliar for US travelers. In 2000,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region." target="_blank"&gt; measles was declared eliminated from the US&lt;/a&gt; due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/measles-elimination-declaration-2000-texas-new-mexico-vaccines-mmr/" target="_blank"&gt; 85 cases&lt;/a&gt; were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiekfyp00083b6mv63s7rz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of this year’s cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieywbg000f3b6mm7vnvrpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they’ve gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there’s a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiez6bs000h3b6majhmf2q5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000d3b6m7ffn9kth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000f3b6m2wc0jkqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year’s outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000g3b6m92llb34j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That means, then, that you’re going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you’re going to give three doses,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000i3b6m5d5437aw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000j3b6m9psbirsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is not recommended for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-pregnancy/moms-to-be/index.html#:~:text=Live%20virus%20vaccines%2C%20such%20as,also%20recommended%20for%20pregnant%20women." target="_blank"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbifcsml000j3b6m9s9999j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can’t be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbifk29x000q3b6m9g9uc3po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they’re exposed to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000m3b6mfv3kh7dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000l3b6mac87ej4q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidvax900003b6m9a1hxsdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbie5oxo00053b6mfxq26b20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiely3x000e3b6mywvyabk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn’t need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieyo4v000d3b6mw7n53f9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbie8r1m00073b6mjmih0k3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/pack-smart" target="_blank"&gt;travel guidance&lt;/a&gt; such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list" target="_blank"&gt;country-specific travel health notices&lt;/a&gt; on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000n3b6m3a5cbal1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don’t just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000o3b6m6lpffj8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5779523/" target="_blank"&gt;four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate&lt;/a&gt;. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000p3b6msvvvf0xh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieck5q00093b6mr84yusx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we’ve brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it’s still a lot. And we’re seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We’ve had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Kidney disease is often diagnosed incidentally during routine blood or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/urologist-reveals-the-one-trick-to-check-your-kidney-health-without-any-test-101748933204888.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="urine tests"&gt;urine tests&lt;/a&gt; for other conditions.

&lt;p&gt;A dream that Mikael Genberg has nurtured for more than a quarter century could come true today (June 5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish artist's "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/moonhouse-artwork-mikael-genberg-ispace" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/moonhouse-artwork-mikael-genberg-ispace"&gt;Moonhouse&lt;/a&gt;," a project he devised way back in 1999, is set to touch down on &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/55-earths-moon-formation-composition-and-orbit.html"&gt;the moon&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon aboard &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/astronomy/moon/japanese-company-ispace-will-attempt-historic-moon-landing-on-june-5" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/astronomy/moon/japanese-company-ispace-will-attempt-historic-moon-landing-on-june-5"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt;, a lander operated by the Japanese company ispace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artwork — a tiny replica of the red-and-white houses that dot the Swedish countryside — is mounted on the front bumper of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/ispace-mini-moon-rover-tenacious" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/ispace-mini-moon-rover-tenacious"&gt;Tenacious&lt;/a&gt;, a microrover built by ispace's European subsidiary. If Resilience touches down safely today and everything thereafter goes to plan as well, Tenacious will deploy from the lander and drop the Moonhouse onto the lunar dirt, giving the gray landscape a solitary spark of vibrant color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space.com caught up with Genberg via email recently to discuss the Moonhouse, how he's feeling with the touchdown try just around the corner and what a successful landing would mean to him. The questions and answers are presented below in their entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;"The Moonhouse" artist Mikael Genberg. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: The Moonhouse/Mathias Nordgren)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: How and when did you first get the idea to put a little Swedish house on the moon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mikael Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;Working as an artist is, in many ways, about trying to describe the world, life, and human beings from different perspectives. All culture is essentially that: describing and re-describing what it means to be here. The house, as a symbol, holds in my mind a unique combination of survival and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first imagined a typical Swedish house standing on the moon, I instantly felt the power of the image, but also its impossibility. I had no competence, no funding, no connections. Still, the thought didn’t leave me. I started talking about it, first with close friends, then with others. Gradually, a sense of shared purpose, or something like that, began to form around the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KrhZc67tqxUANDgbvgEy9U" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KrhZc67tqxUANDgbvgEy9U slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, the concept managed to survive, and even grow, for 26 years, carried forward by its own poetry, craziness and hardship and by the incredible support of people who believed in it. That persistence of the idea itself is kind of an artwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What does this piece mean to you? What do you hope it achieves, or how do you hope it affects people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg:&lt;/strong&gt; To me, the Moonhouse is both a shared achievement, something made possible by the efforts of many individuals, but also a profoundly personal thing. Being able to touch the moon with a small house that I painted in the kitchen of our red house from 1758 creates deeper emotions than I expected. It’s like putting my finger on that distant white disc in the sky. An impossibility that comes to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a small house in a vast, empty place, a symbol of belonging, curiosity, and vulnerability. I hope it invites people to reflect on our relationship to space, and to recognize the fragility and uniqueness of our own world, this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/pale-blue-dot-voyager-1-photo-30th-anniversary.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/pale-blue-dot-voyager-1-photo-30th-anniversary.html"&gt;Pale Blue Dot&lt;/a&gt;, packed with life, all related to each other. The Moonhouse doesn’t claim anything except maybe to be art, but even that is of no real interest. It’s a small red house standing on the moon. That’s all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="youtube-video youtube-facade" data-nosnippet&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: How do you feel now, being so close to the lunar landing? What emotions are running through you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg:&lt;/strong&gt; It's a strange mix of awe, anxiety, disbelief, and sheer, childish happiness. So many things have had to go right just to reach this point. There's excitement, of course, but also a deep sense of humility in understanding the challenges that still lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm trying not to get swept away by the emotions entirely, but instead to stay present in this moment. Whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What would mission success — Tenacious deploying the Moonhouse onto the gray dirt — mean to you? What would it mean to humanity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;If it works, if the Moonhouse actually stands there on the lunar surface, I think it would be a moment of something extraordinary. Maybe more poetry than art. For me personally, it would be the culmination of imagination, persistence, and collaboration with so many wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for what it might mean to humanity, that's really up to each person. I love that people have already responded in their own creative ways: sending us songs, children's drawings, poems. That, to me, is success, when an idea sparks new ideas in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope the Moonhouse can become a small cultural marker. Something that says: we were here, and we brought not just our technology, but our dreams, our symbols of home. We come in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space.com: What if Resilience fails during its landing attempt on June 5? Will you still regard the Moonhouse project as a success?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genberg: &lt;/strong&gt;That's hard to say. In the moment, I'm sure I would feel deep disappointment. But with some distance, I believe I'll be able to see how the Moonhouse has already succeeded in many ways. It exists. It was built. It sparked thoughts, conversations and creativity across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I hope it lands safely. But I also accept that space missions are, by nature, super-risky. No matter what happens, the House will reach the moon. The only question is in what shape.&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p&gt;On May 14, 2025, the Division of Overdose Prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that the number of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/10/05/overdose-may-be-decreasing--but-not-for-everyone/" target="_blank"&gt;overdose deaths&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-statement-from-cdcs-national-center-for-injury-prevention-and-control-on-provisional-2024.html"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; 27%. This was an extraordinary, even historic announcement, given overdoses had risen relentlessly for more than 33 years, resulting in the deaths of more than a million Americans, with another 1 million projected to die before this decade is over. Now, for more than a year, overdose deaths have decreased every single month, most dramatically for deaths caused by &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/fentanyl" target="_blank"&gt;illicit fentanyl&lt;/a&gt; — considered the toughest problem, given the opioid’s high potency, simplicity of manufacture, and ease of smuggling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That very same day, the new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/14/rfk-jr-congress-testimony/"&gt;testimony before Congress&lt;/a&gt;, made no reference to overdoses, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-statement-from-cdcs-national-center-for-injury-prevention-and-control-on-provisional-2024.html"&gt;number one killer of Americans 18 to 44 years of age&lt;/a&gt;, nor to the recent success. A week later, in his agency’s 72-page “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assessment.pdf"&gt;Making America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” manifesto, the word “opioid” was never mentioned. Instead, he went on to propose that CDC should be disassembled, along with the other principal agencies responsible for addressing the overdose crisis.  Those proposals, as part of the administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf"&gt;2026 fiscal year budget&lt;/a&gt;,  passed the House and await action by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For nearly thirty years I was a CDC scientist. I have been outspokenly critical of how CDC and those other agencies have handled the opioid crisis, but the solution is not to take a wrecking ball to the institutions that protect us, particularly when we seem to be making progress. What will be the consequences? A health secretary who systematically ignores mention of the major killer of adult Americans is clearly not interested in research on what could account for a decrease in deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But among recent national initiatives, the push to increase availability of the opioid overdose antidote, &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/05/16/why-everyone-should-learn-how-to-administer-naloxone/" target="_blank"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt; (brand name Narcan), has clearly played a role. Between 2021 and 2023, the number of naloxone doses dispensed from retail pharmacies doubled, &lt;a href="https://end-overdose-epidemic.org/highlights/ama-reports/2024-report/"&gt;and millions of additional doses were distributed by harm reduction organizations&lt;/a&gt;. Then in March 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-over-counter-naloxone-nasal-spray"&gt;over-the-counter distribution of a nasal spray version&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been outspokenly critical of how CDC and those other agencies have handled the opioid crisis, but the solution is not to take a wrecking ball to the institutions that protect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the year, &lt;a href="https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/emergent-biosolutions-continues-broaden-access-awareness-and"&gt;20 million doses had been dispensed&lt;/a&gt;. The decline in overdose death rates started the month after the nasal spray became widely available. Temporal sequence is not causation, but in a public health crisis, a plausible step is mass distribution of an antidote easily administered by lay persons. Few interventions in medicine are more cost-effective than saving a life in ten seconds for $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after being put in charge of the U.S. health care system in February 2025, Kennedy, called for &lt;a href="https://washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/02/trump-naloxone-overdose-funding-cuts"&gt;immediate decreased funding for naloxone&lt;/a&gt;. And he didn’t stop there. Slated for &lt;a href="https://fabbs.org/news/2025/04/hhs-budget-leaked-includes-nih-reorganization/"&gt;abolition is the National Institute for Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, the research group at the National Institutes of Health that helped develop the nasal version of naloxone. NIDA is currently researching opioid analgesics with lower addiction risk and developing wastewater detection systems to provide early warning of new illicit drugs. What is left of NIDA will be absorbed, with other decimated institutes, into a single entity focused on “behavioral health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the chopping block is the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/hhs-addiction-mental-health-rfk-samsha-e83db20b4ef801971cd25d07eb41bcf9"&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which provides the major funding for state and local naloxone distribution and drug treatment programs. CDC’s Division of Overdose Prevention, which is responsible for monitoring the drug epidemic, is marked for demolition too, despite having just reported the unprecedented reduction in overdose deaths. Adding to the threat of a renewed overdose explosion, the CDC issued the stark warning of a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7348a2.htm"&gt;seven-fold rise in overdoses from illicit carfentanil&lt;/a&gt;, an opioid 100 times more potent than fentanyl — so potent that the drug is used to sedate elephants and minuscule amounts can easily kill a person. Remnants of SAMHSA and the CDC’s Division of Overdose Prevention will be folded into the new “Agency for Healthy America." Even if we assume that every cent of the budgets of the &lt;a href="http://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/samhsa-fy-2025-cj.pdf"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/budget-information/fiscal-year-2025-budget-information-congressional-justification-national-institute-drug-abuse"&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/injury/budget-funding/overdose-prevention-funding.html"&gt;drug control groups&lt;/a&gt; is eliminated, the total reduction in the &lt;a href="https://usafacts.org/answers/how-much-does-the-us-federal-government-spend/country/united-states/"&gt;federal budget&lt;/a&gt; would be one-tenth of one percent, or considerably less than the cost of one &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/meet-the-navys-new-13-billion-aircraft-carrier/"&gt;aircraft carrier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the new director of the Office of Management and Budget, Russell Vought, these &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/05/20/federal-workers-trump-mental-health/"&gt;transformations&lt;/a&gt; should be done in a way to assure that the federal workforce will “be traumatically affected,” and “viewed as the villains.” What should the few remaining traumatically affected villains do about the drug crisis? Kennedy, who attributes his heroin recovery to 12-step abstinence, made that clear in his 2024 documentary: “We’re going to build hundreds of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/02/28/there-is-no-evidence-rfk-jrs-plan-for-healing-farms-somehow-helps-people-quit/" target="_blank"&gt;healing farms&lt;/a&gt;” — places where people with addiction “learn the discipline of hard work” and “get re-parented,” all the while bringing “a new industry to these forgotten corners of America.” Antidotes, treatment, prevention? These are at best irrelevant — more likely, a moral hazard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you learn in public health is that all victories are temporary. Back in 2000, the CDC group where I worked demonstrated that ongoing transmission of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2025/03/11/you-dont-want-to-throw-a-measles-party/" target="_blank"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; — the most infectious pathogen known to humankind — had been eliminated from the U.S., thanks to nationwide hard work to raise immunization levels. A quarter-century later, because of lowered immunization levels consequent to a torrent of vaccine misinformation by Kennedy and others, there have been more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;1,000 measles cases in 30 states&lt;/a&gt; over the first five months of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is now before Congress: If the agencies battling the drug epidemic are disabled, will a renewed explosion of deaths result? The last time the current president was in office, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"&gt;overdose rates rose more than 44%&lt;/a&gt; over the course of his tenure — the largest overdose increase in American history, with more than 300,000 lives lost. This time, we may never know if history is repeating itself since the systems that monitor overdose deaths are themselves subject to elimination. However, families of future overdose victims may still wonder if 2025 was the year we helped make Americans die again.&lt;/p&gt;

The variant, which was first discovered in China earlier this year, currently accounts for 10% of the SARS-CoV-2 sequences tested from around the world, according to recent &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;surveillance data&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DU6FHVGHHZHBXCWXWEHF5PUEAQ"&gt;That’s a huge leap from 2.5% four weeks ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LHCEUEY6UNH4BLTL6547VQNLII"&gt;A Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency is in regular contact with international partners about the activity of NB.1.8.1. Currently, only 20 NB.1.8.1 sequences have been identified in the US – which is below the threshold that’s needed for a variant to appear on &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variants-genomic-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variants-genomic-surveillance"&gt;the agency’s COVID dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4FHM5BDMOFBSVABEKKXMQPJPAQ"&gt;The spokesperson even added that as soon as its prevalence increases, the new variant would show up on the tracker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HDB3IOZQQRBS5DF3UJKXR4XJ64"&gt;One important thing to note: according to infectious disease specialists, there are no alarming differences between the symptoms of NB.1.8.1 and those caused by other versions of SARS-CoV-2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OOGV6KR77FGXJP26OUUY27IDJI"&gt;“Currently, it appears that NB.1.8.1 would have similar symptoms to other COVID variants that have recently been circulating,” &lt;a href="https://www.pediatrix.com/find-care/doctors/hoy-zachary-1629399019" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Dr. Zachary Hoy,&lt;/a&gt; a pediatric infectious disease specialist with Pediatrix Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="D2CZWWEWEJG6ZH7DKUR24RTXF4"&gt;Here’s what you should know about the newest COVID variant that’s making its rounds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3QHAFMV4EFGLPMGT6EAQ6O3XRQ"&gt;Compared to the current variant that’s dominating the U.S., which is LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1has multiple new mutations on the spike protein that could enhance its ability to bind to our cells, according to the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BBAI4LTNMNGPZD6SRUX4P5KSMM"&gt;These mutations could increase the virus’ transmissibility and potentially diminish the effectiveness of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706198/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8706198/"&gt;neutralizing antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that prevent pathogens from latching to our cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AP6QB73WMNHTFDEWIESR44JE5M"&gt;In simpler terms, the variant could be skilled at evading some of our defenses, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00015-5/fulltext"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WWGS54YCFBHVNJAE5DFWWXXFXU"&gt;When it comes to the signs and symptoms of the new variant, NB.1.8’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; are the same as those seen with SARS-CoV-2 variants, according to &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3528/amesh-adalja"&gt;Dr. Amesh Adalja&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious diseases expert and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3XXGSVZJQBHKDFLYC4ZBMUFYQA"&gt;Two of COVID’s telltale symptoms are a mild, but persistent dry cough and nasal congestion.

The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the paper that the team initially thought the results were “too good to be true”, adding that they hoped the new nanoparticle design could be a “new pathway to an HIV cure”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gWMNUM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/05/7/52/iStock-656712076.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="HIV can ‘hide’ itself in white blood cells, meaning the immune system and treatment drugs is unable to find and tackle them." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-51323"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;HIV can ‘hide’ itself in white blood cells, meaning the immune system and treatment drugs is unable to find and tackle them.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So we had to believe it.

&lt;p&gt;We all know stretching is good for us—that’s why it feels so good—but did you know that there are two types of stretch that have different benefits?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static stretching involves holding a stretch and lengthening a muscle for an extended period of time, while dynamic stretching uses controlled and active movement to increase mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Jill Drummond, a NASM-certified Pilates instructor and personal trainer at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bodybarpilates.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://bodybarpilates.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;BODYBAR Pilates&lt;/a&gt; to understand the differences, and Drummond shared a routine that combines both types to help you develop your overall mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a static stretch?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Static stretching is what most people envision when they think of stretching—it involves holding a position for 30 to 60 seconds to target a specific muscle,” says Drummond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This type of stretching helps elongate muscles, increase range of motion and alleviate stiffness and soreness.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Static stretches are also great for increased blood flow, reduced muscle tension and stress, and enhanced relaxation and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is a dynamic stretch?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dynamic stretching, a fundamental component of Pilates, involves controlled, active movements that take joints and muscles through their full range of motion,” says Drummond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These movements mimic real-life activities, helping to improve mobility and overall joint function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic stretching contributes to improved blood circulation, reduced stiffness in muscles and joints, enhanced flexibility and mobility, better performance in daily activities and workouts and injury prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the best results, you should combine both static and dynamic stretches in your routine.

Gently pull your elbows back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoulder stretch: &lt;/strong&gt;Reach your right arm to the left across your body, place your left elbow under your right elbow and use your left forearm to gently pull your right arm into your chest. Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triceps stretch: &lt;/strong&gt;Raise your right arm and bend your elbow so your right hand is behind your head. Use your left hand to gently pull your elbow back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It means there is a reservoir of the HIV in the body, capable of reactivation, that neither the immune system nor drugs can tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"global-development","tags":[{"id":"global-development/global-development","type":"Keyword","title":"Global development"},{"id":"global-development/global-health","type":"Keyword","title":"Global health"},{"id":"society/aids-and-hiv","type":"Keyword","title":"Aids and HIV"},{"id":"science/medical-research","type":"Keyword","title":"Medical research"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/kat-lay","type":"Contributor","title":"Kat Lay"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/global-development","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Global Development"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"global-development/2025/jun/05/breakthrough-in-search-for-hiv-cure-leaves-researchers-overwhelmed","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne, have demonstrated a way to make the virus visible, paving the way to fully clear it from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is based on mRNA technology, which came to prominence during the Covid-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/nov/01/flu-cancer-hiv-after-covid-success-what-next-for-mrna-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;when it was used in vaccines&lt;/a&gt; made by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60001-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper published in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers have shown for the first time that mRNA can be delivered into the cells where HIV is hiding, by encasing it in a tiny, specially formulated fat bubble. The mRNA then instructs the cells to reveal the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Globally, there are &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;almost 40 million people&lt;/a&gt; living with HIV, who must take medication for the rest of their lives in order to suppress the virus and ensure they do not develop symptoms or transmit it. For many it remains deadly, with UNAids figures suggesting one person died of HIV every minute in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It was “previously thought impossible” to deliver mRNA to the type of white blood cell that is home to HIV, said Dr Paula Cevaal, research fellow at the Doherty Institute and co-first author of the study, because those cells did not take up the fat bubbles, or lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), used to carry it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team have developed a new type of LNP that those cells will accept, known as LNP X. She said: “Our hope is that this new nanoparticle design could be a new pathway to an HIV cure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When a colleague first presented test results at the lab’s weekly meeting, Cevaal said, they seemed too good to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We sent her back into the lab to repeat it, and she came back the next week with results that were equally good. So we had to believe it. And of course, since then, we’ve repeated it many, many, many more times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We were overwhelmed by how [much of a] night and day difference it was – from not working before, and then all of a sudden it was working. And all of us were just sitting gasping like, ‘wow’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further research will be needed to determine whether revealing the virus is enough to allow the body’s immune system to deal with it, or whether the technology will need to be combined with other therapies to eliminate HIV from the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study is laboratory based and was carried out in cells donated by HIV patients. The path to using the technology as part of a cure for patients is long, and would require successful tests in animals followed by safety trials in humans, likely to take years, before efficacy trials could even begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the field of biomedicine, many things eventually don’t make it into the clinic – that is the unfortunate truth; I don’t want to paint a prettier picture than what is the reality,” stressed Cevaal. “But in terms of specifically the field of HIV cure, we have never seen anything close to as good as what we are seeing, in terms of how well we are able to reveal this virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“So from that point of view, we’re very hopeful that we are also able to see this type of response in an animal, and that we could eventually do this in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Michael Roche of the University of Melbourne and co-senior author of the research, said the discovery could have broader implications beyond HIV, with the relevant white blood cells also involved in other diseases including cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jonathan Stoye, a retrovirologist and emeritus scientist at the Francis Crick Institute, who was not involved in the study, said the approach taken by the Melbourne team appeared be a major advance on existing strategies to force the virus out of hiding, but further studies would be needed to determine how best to kill it after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He added: “Ultimately, one big unknown remains. Do you need to eliminate the entire reservoir for success or just the major part? If just 10% of the latent reservoir survives will that be sufficient to seed new infection? Only time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, that does not detract from the significance of the current study, which represents a major potential advance in delivery of mRNA for therapeutic purposes to blood cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tomáš Hanke of the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford, disputed the idea that getting RNA into white blood cells had been a significant challenge. He said the hope that all cells in the body where HIV was hiding could be reached in this way was “merely a dream”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 05:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxPYm45c0VSS3llblk1QU81MDhLT1RsTlpRYzUxYjFXc1FDSGlodlU0WE1IR21JSVFBalJTZldZS2tINEd2cTRfSlppM004a3RoWUJuU3REQXYyM090Um1TODc0OVZPYlE0cFVqeDlDcVluRS02aWlVbkhJbWhvWDcwNzI1b25hQXJySmlMY19tX2Y0dGNDeThXcHV4dG54VXRxRWliUWxqWlFsRFFUWU1mTy1weWVIemlJRkNTTHM5ZnFVdG8</guid></item><item><title>我尝试了这个“5-2-4 fartlek”步行锻炼一周—这是一个改变游戏规则的人-汤姆的指南 | I tried this '5-2-4 fartlek' walking workout for a week — and it’s a game-changer - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPOS1NVTkxdFQwcWV4b0xONUNMZEZ4c2wyM3drTVdQNHFqZlJ3MjZfMnZhTTFuWmVJTGZsR3BaZGdHbVVkM25RS1Z5WDhqQUlmUVY3V0tBV09MbDIzSU5YY0JwbmtCQzRKZ3BkU0hyaE1aYnlDN0s4Q3BoemRTeHZiLVJELVR2Sk9GTml5NnhCTmNnUXU3NGJKOElPN3NxUGVrcEZaWFVpZ195UjZnLVNPNDl3aWdFX2t0SXlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking workouts are all the rage at the moment — from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina"&gt;silent walking&lt;/a&gt; for your mental health, to the military-inspired &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-i-tried-rucking-instead-of-regular-walking-for-one-week-and-its-a-game-changer" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/forget-10-000-steps-i-tried-rucking-instead-of-regular-walking-for-one-week-and-its-a-game-changer"&gt;rucking technique&lt;/a&gt; to build muscle. But one form of walking workout making headlines is the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-the-japanese-walking-method-for-a-week-and-im-hooked"&gt;Japanese Interval Walking Training&lt;/a&gt; (IWT), which promises to burn more fat and lower your blood pressure by alternating your pace. Unlike walking 10,000 steps, this science-based method raises your heart rate and boosts your cardiovascular fitness in less time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t an entirely new phenomenon, however. "Fartlek" walking has been around for a while, and translates to ‘speed play’ from the native Swedish. It’s all about varying the pace and difficulty throughout your walk, mixing intervals of faster-paced walks with slower rambles, allowing you to catch your breath. A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S1715531224000115?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/abs/pii/S1715531224000115?utm_source=chatgpt.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that alternating periods of brisk and slow walking speeds can improve cardiovascular fitness, boost your overall fitness, and help control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keen to give a new workout a try, I built my own fartlek walking session, and repeated it every morning for seven days. Read on to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-5-2-4-walking-workout-3"&gt;What is the 5-2-4 walking workout? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to get walking? Here’s the workout:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm-up:&lt;/strong&gt; For me, this was a five-minute walk at a reasonable pace, but it might be some bodyweight exercises or stretching.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 minutes:&lt;/strong&gt; Walking at a brisk pace, this is a 7/10 walking effort — you should be working hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 minutes:&lt;/strong&gt; Recovery walk at a slower pace. This should be a 4/10 effort max — you’re still moving, but you should easily be able to hold a conversation with someone next to you, and your heart rate and breathing should return to normal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat four times.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the warm-up, this workout took me around 30 minutes every morning. I programmed the workout onto my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review"&gt;Apple Watch 10 &lt;/a&gt;to avoid having to look at my wrist every few minutes — my watch would buzz when it was time to switch pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this workout is suitable for all levels, as you’re walking speed will be based on your exertion levels, if you’re new to fitness, or you’re returning to exercise following an injury or pregnancy, it’s always a good idea to speak to your doctor before taking on a new routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-tried-this-5-2-4-fartlek-walking-workout-for-a-week-and-it-s-a-game-changer-3"&gt;I tried this 5-2-4 fartlek walking workout for a week — and it’s a game-changer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s my verdict after a week of walking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-W5YcNqZ6Fpo4gD98YStFrV" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-W5YcNqZ6Fpo4gD98YStFrV slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-was-a-step-up-from-the-japanese-walking-method"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was a step up from the Japanese walking method &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who haven’t tried it, the Japanese Interval Walking Training method involves three minutes at a low intensity, then three minutes walking at a high intensity for 30 minutes. This was a slight step up, as the high-intensity part of the workout was longer, and the recovery blocks were shorter. I found that I didn’t have long to catch my breath before I was picking up the pace again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally loved the extra challenge of walking at a brisk pace for five minutes. I thought about my walking technique — engaging my core so my abs were working, keeping my chest open and shoulders down, and swinging my arms as I moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to fartlek walking, or you’re getting back into fitness, it might be a good idea to try the three-minute intervals first and build up to five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-got-a-lot-done-in-30-minutes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I got a lot done in 30 minutes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all working parents will appreciate, I have a lot to juggle, and despite writing about fitness for a living, sometimes it’s my workouts that suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite only being 30 minutes long, I felt like I’d worked hard with this interval walk. I’d raised my heart rate higher than I would typically do on a dog walk, and I’ve found interval walking is a great option for those who want to reap the benefits of walking, without the time to take a longer stroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking can help improve your overall fitness, build muscle, strengthen your bones and joints, and help boost your mood and lower stress. You’ll also burn more calories doing a fartlek walk than you typically would walking at the same pace for the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-lose-weight-and-get-in-shape-by-walking"&gt;walking for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, remember the key is to be in a calorie deficit, burning more calories than you consume. One of the easiest ways to keep an eye on your pace, heart rate, and calorie burn is to strap one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-m-still-hooked"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m still hooked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was instantly hooked after a week of the Japanese walking method, and I equally enjoyed this fartlek workout. As a runner, I use my walks as a form of active recovery, but this was a great way to work on my cardiovascular endurance, without the impact of running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also helped me de-stress and boost my mood, plus, it gave me the excuse to take a break from my laptop and spend 30 minutes outdoors in nature — something we should all do more of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If fitting long workouts into your routine feels overwhelming, this can be done with no equipment, on your lunch break, in your local park or even on the treadmill at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the joy of fartlek is the freedom to play with your pace — if structured intervals feel too much, just walk faster for two blocks, then slower for a block, or use street lights as your markers. However fast or slow you walk, you’re getting fitter and healthier with every step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A woman in Texas has died from a rare brain infection after flushing her nose with water stored in the tank of a recreational vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lab tests on the 71-year-old woman's cerebrospinal fluid confirmed she was infected with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naegleria_fowleri"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Naegleria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt; fowleri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny, free-swimming &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"&gt;protozoan&lt;/a&gt; also dubbed 'the brain-eating amoeba,' which causes the highly lethal disease &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naegleriasis"&gt;primary amoebic meningoencephalitis&lt;/a&gt; (PAM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This killer bug hangs out in warm bodies of fresh water like ponds, lakes, and even neglected swimming pools. Most infections occur while swimming or engaging in water sports in these places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;The patient had no recreational exposure to fresh water; however, she had reportedly performed nasal irrigation on several occasions using non-boiled water from the RV potable water faucet during the four days before illness onset," a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;CDC case report&lt;/a&gt; details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;Despite medical treatment for a suspected PAM infection, the patient developed seizures and subsequently died eight days after symptom onset."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities were unable to detect the amoeba in samples from the RV tank or the campground water supply, which may be because they took samples 23 days after the possible exposure took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But testing did indicate the water had inadequate levels of disinfectant to prevent microbes from building biofilm communities that can protect pathogens like &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri. &lt;/em&gt;The water was more cloudy than what is recommended for drinking water, another sign that disinfectant levels may have been inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why you really shouldn't flush tap (or RV tank) water up your nose for nasal irrigation: the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/naegleria/prevention/sinus-rinsing.html"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; only distilled or sterilized water be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because while &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; likes things lukewarm, it &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;loves hotter liquids: the kinds sloshing around inside our bodies, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it enters a human body, &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri &lt;/em&gt;passes a temperature threshold – about 25 degrees Celsius or 77 degrees Fahrenheit – that transforms the bug from its flagellate state into an insatiable &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophozoite"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophozoite"&gt;rophozoite&lt;/a&gt;, a form in which the microbe is actively feeding and reproducing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any other entryway to the body, and &lt;em&gt;N. fowleri&lt;/em&gt; will be politely escorted out by our immune system or burned up by stomach acids. But via the nose, it has an alarmingly straightforward route to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This ravenous pathogen chews through the membrane we use to smell with, the olfactory epithelium, and follows the nerve fibers that carry scent signals back to our brains, nibbling at astrocytes and neurons along the way until it reaches its cerebral target.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163765" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163765" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-642x425.jpeg" alt="US Woman Dies From Brain-Eating Amoeba After Flushing Sinuses With RV Water" class="size-medium wp-image-163765" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-642x425.jpeg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-627x415.jpeg 627w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-768x508.jpeg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-1536x1017.jpeg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-2048x1356.jpeg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/Meningo-encephalite_amibienne_primitive-600x397.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163765" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Direct fluorescent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="163623" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; stain showing amebic meningoencephalitis due to &lt;em&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;While this disease is very rare, the prognosis is dire: of the 164 cases reported in the US between 1962 and 2023, only 4 people have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;This case reinforces the potential for serious health risks associated with improper use of nasal irrigation devices, as well as the importance of maintaining RV water quality and ensuring that municipal water systems adhere to regulatory standards," the report &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full CDC report is available &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/health-ministry"&gt;Health Ministry&lt;/a&gt; issued an unusual statement Wednesday regarding a sperm donor who carried a rare genetic mutation that increases the risk of cancer among offspring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ministry urged offspring in their forties and fifties who were born from sperm donations in private clinics in the central region to go directly to one of the genetic institutes across the country for testing as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case began several months ago when the family of a deceased sperm donor informed the Health Ministry that he had Lynch syndrome, a condition that increases the risk of developing various cancers, including colon, uterus, stomach, ovaries, and other organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deceased had donated sperm at private fertility clinics in central Israel between 1974 and 1985, before regulated sperm banks were established. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unknown how many children were born from his donations, but the Health Ministry estimates it could be dozens, or even over a hundred. The offspring themselves do not know who the sperm donor is, but it is known that he donated only at private clinics in the central region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt; The program is part of a national effort to alleviate the Israeli doctor shortage. (Illustrative). (credit: INGIMAGE)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Ministry, the risk of carrying the mutation among children born from these sperm samples is 50 percent. For carriers, there is now a structured medical surveillance program designed to detect cancer at an early stage and thereby save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Health Ministry called on women and families who received sperm donations during those years in private clinics in the central region to inform their offspring and recommend that they contact one of the 10 genetic institutes across the country directly to check for the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No referral from a doctor is needed, and one can approach directly. The test is not covered by insurance and costs 633 shekels. Those who are found to be carriers will be eligible for full medical treatment, including early detection tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Talia Eldar-Geva, head of the &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/fertility"&gt;Fertility&lt;/a&gt; and Reproduction Department at the Health Ministry, said: “We are aware of the complexity of the situation, especially given that some families who received sperm donations 40-50 years ago may have hidden the fact from their offspring, and may now decide to reveal the ‘secret’ only because of this incident. But since detecting the carrier status and then performing all the early detection tests can lead to early diagnosis, early treatment, reduced risk of illness, and sometimes even save lives — the Health Ministry feels obligated to address this case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Israeli case joins a series of troubling incidents reported in recent years in Europe and the United States, where sperm donors carried rare genetic mutations that were passed on to their offspring, sometimes without them ever knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, at the recent European Genetics Conference in Milan, a case was presented of a sperm donor from Europe found to be a carrier of Li-Fraumeni syndrome — a very serious genetic condition that causes a high risk of early-onset cancers, including leukemia, breast cancer, and brain cancer. That donor fathered at least 67 children in eight different countries, ten of whom have already been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation in that case affects the TP53 gene, known as the “guardian of the genome” due to its role in repairing &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/dna"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; damage. At the time of donation in the early 2000s, the mutation was not yet recognized as a clear risk factor. But today, with advances in genetic testing, it has been identified as a particularly dangerous mutation, and the lab in France that received the samples determined unequivocally that it is cancer-causing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, all the offspring were referred for genetic testing and regular medical supervision. Ten of them have already been diagnosed with cancer, and 23 others were found to be carriers of the mutation. Medical recommendations include regular MRI scans, breast and abdominal checks, and sometimes even periodic blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fake-br-for-article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A drug used to relieve the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397"&gt;debilitating symptoms of menopause&lt;/a&gt; may also be reducing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/breast-cancer-is-rising-in-young-american-women-and-we-dont-know-why"&gt;invasive breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, a new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="163357" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; by Northwestern University suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 60,000 women a year are diagnosed with a &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/dcis-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ/"&gt;contained form of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; that can indicate a higher risk of developing invasive tumors later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-invasive  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="163357" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; is typically detected during routine mammograms, accounts for up to 25 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses, and has a 98 percent recovery rate after 10 years when removed by surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to increase their chance of remaining cancer-free many patients also undergo treatments like radiation and hormone therapy following surgery. These treatments often have debilitating side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojddACFfVa8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02694809"&gt;The phase two clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; recruited 141 postmenopausal women who have a form of contained breast cancer called &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/dcis-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ/"&gt;ductal carcinoma tumors&lt;/a&gt;. Half of them were given a medication for managing symptoms of menopause called Duavee; others were administered a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="163357" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; for the month between diagnosis and breast cancer surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duavee is composed of estrogen hormones and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazedoxifene"&gt;bazedoxifene&lt;/a&gt; – a molecule that either promotes or dampens the use of estrogens in the body, depending on the type of tissue it is in. This estrogen receptor modifier is also used to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2019.1615882"&gt;help treat osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who took the drug had notably less cell growth in their breast tissue by their surgery date. &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/2025-asco-annual-meeting/16337?presentation=243651#243651"&gt;There was also&lt;/a&gt; "no impact on quality of life compared to placebo."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What excites me most is that a medication designed to help women feel better during menopause may also reduce their risk of invasive breast cancer," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/05/menopause-drug-duavee-may-help-prevent-invasive-breast-cancer-clinical-trial-finds/?fj=1"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern University surgeon Swati Kulkarni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163364" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BreastCancerCellsWithGreenFluroProteinMarkersNCI.jpg" alt="Rounded clumps outlined in green with blue clusters withing." class="wp-image-163364 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BreastCancerCellsWithGreenFluroProteinMarkersNCI.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/BreastCancerCellsWithGreenFluroProteinMarkersNCI-364x415.jpg 364w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163364" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Breast cancer cells highlighted in green cell surface protein markers and DNA in blue. (&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/biology"&gt;Tom Misteli/Karen Meaburn/&lt;/a&gt;NCI)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, trial participants taking Duavee did not experience the intolerable side effects associated with other cancer drugs. Rather, it tends to increase the quality of life in people already struggling with menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While larger studies are still needed to confirm Duavee's ability to prevent breast cancer, Kulkarni and team suggest that, for now, those with elevated risk for breast cancer as well as menopausal symptoms would most likely benefit from Duavee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially given women with prior cancer lesions can't resort to hormone treatments to ease their menopause symptoms because they can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(19)31709-x"&gt;increase the risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; returning.&lt;/p&gt;

Even then they were not discovered after every vaginal delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers say their findings do not justify the practice of vaginal seeding,  where some new parents smear babies with a swab taken from the vagina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The good bacteria seem to be coming from the end of the mother's digestive system, an idea known in the field as the "first lick".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I feel pretty confident in saying that vaginal seeding is not a good thing," said Prof Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the long-term ambition is to come up with microbial therapies – like a probiotic yogurt – that could be given to babies to set their microbiomes on a healthy path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Louise Kenny, from the University of Liverpool and a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: "A caesarean section is often a life-saving procedure, and can be the right choice for a woman and her baby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She said that while the benefit was seen only in babies born vaginally, it was not in every child born that way so "further research is needed to create a full, nuanced picture".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:48:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE96UXZzbVdpQTZZSjAtMFY0RlVYS3YyNEJ1UncxRjc5SzY0cmpHVGw4N3BiRy1LTHhwLWJ2d1FMR3k5Tjh2NVl1OF9jZkRxQUxRZXk5ZHU5Wi13UdIBX0FVX3lxTE9wSHcyazJkbDF2WEV3Uk51LXZQekpHME4tbHRCcktLYmFLQjZkdlpkUGcwbmFFdW5JLTZmTFdTQ1VTVjNyQURJaGplc1NoTDhZWUVCc2prN01EQnFYMjNR</guid></item><item><title>15种富含视黄醇的食物刺激胶原蛋白- VOGUE | 15 Retinol-Rich Foods To Stimulate Collagen - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXEFVX3lxTE1vNm5mei1FblZVRmRHTk54bEI2emFWZ0UtLXl5eHpOeGkzQ2VtQkI3YklHb0tnUXhVbG5hVkVsb08tV0ltT1haREJfcUFrYUFpNklwYlI3cWljX25T?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that topically applying &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/retinol-retinoids-guide-fine-lines-sun-damage-healthy-glow" target="_blank"&gt;retinol&lt;/a&gt; can make a major difference when it comes to reversing damage to your skin. An active form of vitamin A, retinol is considered the gold-star anti-aging ingredient when it comes to smoothing lines, clearing acne, and reversing sun damage. But you don't have to simply incorporate it into your nighttime routine: Vitamin A is available in your diet, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diet plays a significant role in our skin’s health and appearance,” says Manhattan-based board-certified dermatologist &lt;a data-offer-url="http://www.drdendyengelman.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"http://www.drdendyengelman.com/"}' href="http://www.drdendyengelman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dendy Engelman, MD, FAAD&lt;/a&gt;. “There are studies to support that increased vitamin intake helps skin in both the aging space and acne.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's how you can take advantage of vitamin A in your diet to improve your skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin (more on that later) that is key for a healthy body. “The human body does not produce vitamin A, so it must be obtained externally through our diet and skincare,” Dr. Engelman says. “Retinol, like other retinoids, is a derivative of vitamin A. When applied topically to the skin, it is converted to retinoic acid, the active form of vitamin A in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the edible form, vitamin A comes in two forms: retinol, which is found in foods that originate from animals, and carotenoids, which are derived from plant-based foods and converted into vitamin A when digested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Appropriate vitamin A intake helps support healthy skin, hair, and nails,” Dr. Engelman adds. “Vitamin A plays a role in regulating sebum production and cell turnover, which are important for maintaining a healthy skin barrier (including the scalp) and supporting the hair growth cycle. Vitamin A is also necessary for the synthesis of keratin, which is a vital structural protein for both hair and nails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daily requirement of vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily vitamin A requirements vary depending on age, sex, and health conditions (if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, that changes it, too). According to the Mayo Clinic, adult males should take 900 micrograms (mcg) and adult women should take 700 mcg. It is important to note that the body does not need large amounts of vitamin A every day, but regular, balanced intake is essential to maintain the right balance and prevent deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A warning about vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to note that consuming too much vitamin A can actually be very toxic for the human body, leading to a condition known as ‘hypervitaminosis A,’” adds Dr. Engelman. “This can result in a number of unwanted and potentially dangerous side effects—including, ironically, a disrupted and unhealthy skin barrier, and hair loss. Therefore, it is very important to avoid excessive consumption of vitamin A (or any compound!) and speak with your doctor to determine the diet that’s best for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;15 vitamin A-rich foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 ounces of liver (especially beef or chicken), which will &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;meet the daily dose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 cup of fortified dairy products like milk, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;185 mcgs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup cantaloupe, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;135 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 large hard-boiled egg, &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;75 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 ounces of salmon, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;60 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup raw carrots, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;460 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup spinach, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;570 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;½ cup raw red peppers, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;120 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 sweet potato with skin, which will &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;meet the daily dose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;chard, roughly &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1"}' href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content?contenttypeid=76&amp;amp;contentid=11147-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 dried sulfured apricots, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;65 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;peaches, roughly &lt;a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/sshw/message/message.php?p=Health&amp;amp;m=301" target="_blank"&gt;24 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 whole mango, roughly &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;115 mcg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 00:31:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE1vNm5mei1FblZVRmRHTk54bEI2emFWZ0UtLXl5eHpOeGkzQ2VtQkI3YklHb0tnUXhVbG5hVkVsb08tV0ltT1haREJfcUFrYUFpNklwYlI3cWljX25T</guid></item><item><title>这就是为什么蚊子比其他人更能叮咬某些人的原因- BuzzFeed | So THAT'S Why Mosquitoes Bite Some People More Than Others - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFBVck1MUnFfN0ZtUzZmQmVMblQ4NmhCZHAtUEM4bjRHOGM3Q3ZBdkhRazhqMWRBV0FtUlR2N0gyczdlbVlHVWFhX05iLW41ZVNuTjVKdmdETjRUZlU0VnlQU3JUdGxsM284VEpYMlRPNUZ6ckhTNmE2TA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--long__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Despite the controversy over the health effects of DEET, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/deet" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;a 2014 review by the Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; re-concluded that normal use of DEET products does not pose a risk to one’s health, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;including&lt;/a&gt; children, pregnant women and breastfeeding women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEET is the most effective,” Piliang said. “If you are going to be in a mosquito-prone place, knowing that they carry disease, it is your best bet. Take a shower later to wash it off, and put on just a little bit.” Always read the directions on a spray before using it, and help children apply products by following the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while you may have heard that candles containing natural repellents like citronella oil can be useful, there is no &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/17/1/24/2996380" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7884082" data-affiliate="true"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to support it yet. Instead, keep the fan on or hang out in a breezy area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mosquitoes can’t get around very much,” especially in wind, Piliang said. “You can run a fan to keep air moving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do end up with a bite, you may or may not be bothered. “This all depends on how allergic you are to the chemicals in the saliva of the mosquito, and that can vary based on the type of the mosquito or how reactive you and your skin are to things in the environment,” Piliang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it is itchy, the worst possible thing you can do is scratch it.&lt;/p&gt;

Major, 26, started using Mounjaro to lose weight before planning to try for her third baby in a few years' time, but was shocked six weeks later to find she was pregnant. She was taking the contraceptive pill at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I have polycystic ovaries as well, so I can't get pregnant easily or quickly.

&lt;p&gt;At only 14 years old, Siddarth Nandyala has created a heart disease detection app that can identify early signs of cardiovascular issues in seconds. The app is called Circadian AI, and it could be a powerful tool for early intervention, especially in regions where access to healthcare is limited.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite being the leading cause of death worldwide, early symptoms for heart disease often go unnoticed. That’s because diagnosis depends on invasive tests, advanced imaging, or costly procedures that are not accessible to everyone. And this delay can be fatal, as many individuals discover their condition only after a stroke or heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Nandyala set out to solve this problem by developing a non-invasive, affordable way to screen for heart abnormalities before serious complications arise. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/this-14-year-old-built-an-app-that-detects-heart-diseases-in-seconds-180986700/"&gt;According to &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/this-14-year-old-built-an-app-that-detects-heart-diseases-in-seconds-180986700/"&gt;Smithsonian Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.circadian-ai.com/"&gt;Circadian AI&lt;/a&gt; uses the microphone on your smartphone to record a user’s heartbeat. The sound is then cleaned up using advanced noise-cancellation, and analyzed in the cloud using a machine learning model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within seconds, the app identifies patterns linked to arrhythmia, heart valve issues, early signs of heart failure, or coronary artery disease. The interface presents users with a summary that highlights any abnormalities and encourages further testing when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech. Entertainment. Science. Your inbox.&lt;/h4&gt;	&lt;p class="signup-form-info"&gt;Sign up for the most interesting tech &amp;amp; entertainment news out there.&lt;/p&gt;		&lt;p class="signup-form-tos"&gt;By signing up, I agree to the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/terms-of-use/" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; and have reviewed the &lt;a rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank"&gt;Privacy Notice.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;	&lt;span class="success hidden text-white font-bold items-center"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a full-fledged replacement for medical devices like ECGs, of course. But it does provide an effective pre-screening tool for early awareness. And, the app has already been tested in clinical settings. Trials in the United States involved approximately 15,000 participants, while additional testing in India included around 3,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the simple app detected signs of heart disease with over 96% accuracy. Results were later confirmed through traditional diagnostic methods. For now, the app is limited to trained professionals as it undergoes regulatory review and clinical validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nandyala is already working on expanding the heart disease detection app to pick up on lung-related illnesses like pneumonia and pulmonary embolism using similar sound analysis. This is just one more way AI has helped us find new ways to detect deadly diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you think about the rise of artificial intelligence, one thing is clear: AI in medicine can be handy. From &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/tech/crazy-new-ai-can-tell-if-youre-sick-just-by-looking-at-your-tongue/"&gt;AI-powered doctors&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/doctors-left-a-sick-man-for-dead-but-then-ai-saved-his-life/"&gt;AI that saves lives&lt;/a&gt;, there are plenty of ways we can put automated systems to work and make life for both doctors and patients easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbohydrates can be part of a nourishing and balanced eating pattern. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategically choosing carbs that are higher in fiber and nutrients and lower in added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other habits like staying hydrated and being consistent can help support your nutrient needs more than totally avoiding any food group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbohydrates-8423291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;, or carbs, have gotten a bad reputation over the years, often demonized in popular diet trends and wellness influencers. However, the truth about carbohydrates is far more nuanced than what you'll see on social media or hear from the latest fad diet gurus. Cutting carbs drastically may offer temporary results, but for many people, this approach isn’t sustainable. Plus, cutting carbs may result in nutritional gaps or other undesirable outcomes. Can a low-carb diet be beneficial for certain people? Absolutely. But it’s not for everyone. Instead of seeing carbs as the enemy, it’s time to take a more balanced approach that fosters a positive relationship with food and keeps your body functioning at its best.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbs are one of the primary &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291112/what-macros-are-right-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;macronutrients&lt;/a&gt;, alongside fats and proteins. They serve as a major energy source for the body, particularly for the brain and muscles. Carbs are often broken down into glucose, which fuels everything from your daily activities to intense workouts. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290631/what-is-a-complex-carbohydrate/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Complex carbs&lt;/a&gt;, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, also come packed with essential vitamins, fiber and other nutrients that your body needs to thrive. Restricting carbs, or completely cutting out certain nutrient-dense carbs, means you could miss out on key nutrients and energy your body needs to function properly.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Restricting carbs might seem appealing at first, especially given that low-carb diets like keto or Atkins are often touted for their rapid results. But here’s the catch! What works in the short term may fail when it comes to long-term wellness. Here’s why.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You May Experience Nutritional Gaps &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Many carb-rich foods like starchy vegetables, whole grains, fruits and legumes are also extremely nutrient dense,” shared &lt;a href="https://www.feedyourzest.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;McKenzie Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.feedyourzest.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;, M.P.H., RDN.&lt;/a&gt; “Cutting carbs can result in inadequate intake of important nutrients and food compounds including folate, antioxidants and fiber,” McKenzie added. A 2025 study shows that low-carb diets are linked to deficiencies of micronutrients like vitamin C, iron and magnesium, which may result in negative implications in the long run.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study published in 2022 looked at the eating habits of 307 U.S. adults who followed a low-carbohydrate diet and compared what these individuals are to the daily nutritional goals outlined in the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The study found that people on low-carb diets were consuming too much saturated fat, total fats, and sodium. At the same time, they weren’t getting enough fiber, magnesium, potassium and several important vitamins like A, E, D and, in some cases, C and folate.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “One reason why cutting carbs can backfire is because it often leads to low energy,” shared &lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha DeVito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samanthadevitonutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Carbohydrates are your body’s preferred fuel source, especially for your brain and muscles, so when you drastically reduce your intake, you might feel sluggish, irritable or find it harder to concentrate,” DeVito explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Simple carbohydrates, often found in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/added-sugar-drinks-study-8760752" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-added-sugar foods&lt;/a&gt;, can lead to energy crashes and have been linked to poorer brain health and reduced cognitive performance over time. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates, like those found in whole grains, fruits and vegetables, provide a steady, long-lasting source of energy and have been associated with improved memory and better brain health as we age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Unsustainable for Most People &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the biggest reasons cutting carbs backfires is the sheer difficulty of maintaining such a restrictive diet. Eventually, most people revert to their previous eating patterns, often feeling like they’ve “failed.” This cycle of deprivation and overindulgence can harm not just your physical health but also your mental well-being.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cutting carbs completely can seem effective at first, but it often leads to burnout; not because people lack discipline, but because it’s logistically and socially unrealistic,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johannahkatz/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Johannah Katz, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Carbs are part of most meals, cultures and shared experiences. When they’re demonized or off-limits, it can create an ‘all-or-nothing’ mindset, which makes people feel like they’ve failed if they have even a small amount,” she explained. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cultural, religious and economic barriers pose unique challenges to achieving nutritional compliance with low carbohydrate diets.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Rigidity fuels guilt, yo-yo dieting, and ultimately, a strained relationship with food. Sustainable progress comes from flexibility and learning how to include the right kinds of carbs (understanding complex vs simple carbohydrates), not avoid them altogether,” Katz explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Negatively Impact Your Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “By cutting carbs, you could be compromising on your gut health,” explained &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Fiber, which is critical for a healthy gut, is a type of carbohydrate.  90% of people are already not meeting their fiber recommendations so by cutting carbs you could also be making it harder to reach your fiber goals,” she explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you were to cut carbs then you might notice an increase in constipation and it could result in gut microbiome changes,” Sauceda added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing your carbs, it’s important to choose the right ones. Eating high-quality carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits and vegetables is linked to a 33.7% lower risk of constipation. On the flip side, consuming less nutritious carbs like high-added-sugar snacks and refined grains increased constipation risk by 83.4% in an analysis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If cutting carbs isn’t the answer, what’s the alternative? The good news is that you don’t have to totally avoid carbohydrates to feel your best. Instead, focus on incorporating a balanced, sustainable approach to eating that works for you personally.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Quality Over Quantity&lt;/strong&gt;: Not all carbs are created equal. Refined carbs, like white bread and high-added-sugar drinks, are stripped of certain nutrients and may cause blood sugar spikes. On the other hand, complex carbs, like whole grains, sweet potatoes and brown rice, are a natural source of fiber, vitamins and minerals. Focus on adding these nutrient-dense options to your meals rather than avoiding carbs altogether.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Your Meals Balanced&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of fixating on cutting out a particular food group, aim to create balanced meals that include protein, healthy fats and carbohydrates. For instance, pair whole-grain pasta with lean protein like chicken or plant-based options, plus some olive oil and a handful of veggies. This approach ensures you’re fueling your body with what it truly needs without feeling deprived.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Consistency Over Perfection:&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than aiming to eat “perfectly,” focus on consistent habits that support your overall well-being. That might mean having oatmeal for breakfast most days while occasionally enjoying a donut when the mood strikes. Balance is key. There’s no need to label foods as “good” or “bad”.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Active and Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;: Physical activity and hydration are essential compliments to your nutrition. Exercise helps regulate blood sugar and supports gut health, while drinking enough water can help keep gut health in-check too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are not the villain they’ve been made out to be. Your body needs them to function properly and to feel its best. Cutting carbs may offer short-term results, but it often leads to long-term frustration, fatigue and health challenges. By focusing on balance, variety, and listening to your body, you can create a way of eating that nourishes and sustains you over the long haul.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, eating is not about perfection; it’s about supporting your life in a way that feels good and works for you. The right carbs included!

Anyone present in the building (or in any business located within the building) during certain hours is considered likely to have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CCHD said on Wednesday that a person from Hill County came to Great Falls for an appointment on Tuesday, May 27, at Prospect Heights Medical Center (in the vicinity of the 1400 block of Fourth Street South).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, the person began experiencing symptoms of measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abigail Hill, the health officer for Cascade County, explained, "Because measles is airborne, because it entered that building, the entire building is considered exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HILL TALKS ABOUT MEASLES EXPOSURE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Montana Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Human Services says says you can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to two hours after that person has left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of exposure locations associated with the person's visit in Great Falls includes Central Montana Orthopedic Specialists, Sun River Health, Atlas Neurology, the office of Dr. Susan Avery, Quest Diagnostics, and Northwest Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;CCHD GUIDANCE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you may have been exposed but do not receive notice from CCHD within the following several days, you may contact CCHD at 406-791-9242 for directions. Exposed individuals with presumed immunity (see below) do not need to quarantine but should monitor for symptoms for 21 days after the exposure; individuals who do not have presumed immunity are advised to stay home for 21 days and monitor for symptoms. Anyone exposed to measles should also talk to their healthcare provider to understand their individual risk of measles and should consider postponing routine medical care at least 21 days from their last exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first symptoms of measles usually appear about 7-14 days after exposure: fever, cough, runny nose, red watery eyes, and/or white spots in the mouth. A red rash—usually beginning near the hairline and moving downward—typically begins about 2-3 days after the first symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop symptoms, you should continue to stay home except for testing or urgent/emergency treatment. Please call Benefis Health System at 406-731-8300 to arrange for testing or urgent care. It is extremely important that you do not enter a clinic building without calling ahead to the clinic so that precautions can be taken to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are presumed to have immunity to measles if you: have written documentation of adequate vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR); OR laboratory evidence of immunity; OR laboratory confirmation of disease; OR were born before 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure of your vaccination status, call CCHD at 406-791-9242 to check your Montana electronic vaccine records and/or for direction on other ways to obtain your records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/CCHDmeasles"&gt;click here to visit&lt;/a&gt; the CCHD website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;MEASLES IN MONTANA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Montana Department of Public Health &amp;amp; Human Services, all 17 cases of measles in the state are Montana residents, and newly-identified cases are isolating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 17 cases have been reported in four counties in Montana: 10 in Gallatin; three in Hill; two in Flathead; and two in Yellowstone. Two of the cases required hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five cases of measles were reported in Gallatin County in April 2025 - the first confirmed measles cases in Montana since 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/4dHKSlc"&gt;Hill County&lt;/a&gt;, the three cases were all unvaccinated children, and all were reported in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yellowstone County cases were an adult and a child — both unvaccinated — who became ill while traveling outside of the country. Those cases were confirmed this week by the Yellowstone County health agency, who said that the two cases had fully recovered and were no longer contagious by the time they returned to Yellowstone County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No details have been released about the two cases in Flathead County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABOUT MEASLES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the DPHHS &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/MeaslesDPHHS"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;Measles is a highly infectious airborne disease that typically begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, white spots in the mouth, and a red rash that appears about 14 days after exposure. The rash usually starts on the face and spreads downward to the rest of the body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is particularly dangerous for infants for whom vaccination is generally not recommended until 12 months of age. Maintaining a high level of vaccination in the community helps protect infants who are too young to be vaccinated, as well as individuals who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Measles continues to be prevalent in many regions worldwide, resulting in an estimated 300 deaths every day. Cases in the U.S. are generally rare but have been increasing in recent years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best way to protect against measles is vaccination. No changes have been made to the existing measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine recommendations in the United States. Two doses of MMR, a measles-containing vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, are 97 to 99 percent effective in preventing measles. Measles vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1963, and two doses have been recommended for children since 1989.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DPHHS also says that measles is highly contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It is so contagious that if one person has it, 9 out of 10 people around him or her will also become infected if they are not protected. The agency says you can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, even up to two hours after that person has left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An infected person can spread measles to others even before he or she develops symptoms—from four days before they develop the measles rash through four days afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ACROSS THE U.S.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of May, the federal Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported 1,088 cases spread across 33 states, including Montana. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s up from just 285 confirmed cases of measles last year and is the highest number of measles cases our country has seen in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst of the outbreaks has been in the South Plains region of Texas, where more than 600 cases have been reported, most in children under the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are concerned that you have measles or may have been exposed to someone with measles, please contact your &lt;a class="Link" href="https://krtv.org/MontanaHealthAgencies"&gt;county or tribal health department&lt;/a&gt; or primary care provider before seeking care, if safe to do so, for instructions about how to avoid exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Fenugreek seeds offer this mineral in amounts that make it easier to reach the recommended daily target. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have associated magnesium with basic metabolic reactions and muscle relaxation. This connection means that those who include fenugreek in their diets might notice fewer nagging muscle strains during busy weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fenugreek-packs-a-nutritional-punch"&gt;Fenugreek packs a nutritional punch &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek has more than protein and magnesium. The first mention of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/galactomannan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;galactomannan&lt;/a&gt; in fenugreek highlights the presence of a type of soluble fiber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This component seems to support a balanced digestive system by regulating intestinal movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the seeds also provide additional minerals, like iron and potassium, though &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/magnesium-threonate-is-best-supplement-for-improving-brain-health-says-neurologist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; often takes the spotlight for its role in muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some find fenugreek seeds a bit chewy and slightly aromatic, especially when lightly crushed. Toasting them in a dry pan helps soften their sharper notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who prefer milder textures can soak them overnight and blend them into dips for an easy way to boost daily protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-muscle-support-and-normal-digestion"&gt;Muscle support and normal digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet with plenty of protein often supports muscle tissue. Fenugreek participates as an excellent plant-based source that contains amino acids, which may aid in muscle repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those dealing with a hectic schedule can &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hemp-seeds-could-be-a-game-changer-as-an-alternative-protein-source/"&gt;toss &lt;/a&gt;these seeds into rice dishes or soups. Substituting other condiments with crushed fenugreek seeds may enhance taste and add a nutrient advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber in fenugreek seeds also promotes satiety, which can help manage portion sizes. Combined with water, certain components in these seeds expand and encourage a feeling of comfortable fullness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calmer digestive experience often follows, because fiber is &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.906690/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a steady glycemic response as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is more stable energy, which comes in handy for maintaining an active routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-everyday-pointers-for-using-fenugreek"&gt;Everyday pointers for using fenugreek&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground fenugreek powder goes well with marinades or rubs on lean meat. It can also flavor vegetarian stews, giving them a subtle, savory edge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some prefer a cooled fenugreek “&lt;a href="https://fullleafteacompany.com/pages/what-is-fenugreek-tea-history-benefits-more?srsltid=AfmBOopmdXsVkS1d6fw4b7tTWDF-z15ud4uWYDuOdHXPFxNPH_ZWKWgt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;,” steeped briefly to highlight its mild, nutty essence. Others go for fenugreek sprouts in salads or sandwiches, which add an extra crunch packed with vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alu’datt and colleagues emphasized that moderate daily intake of fenugreek can contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/klotho-s-kl-protein-discovered-boosts-lifespan-muscle-brain-power-with-one-dose/"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; support and digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recommended consistent use in small amounts, but cautioned that guidance from a health professional is essential before introducing new ingredients into a regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nursing-mothers-and-fenugreek-seeds"&gt;Nursing mothers and fenugreek seeds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenugreek may also help women during breastfeeding. In a clinical trial with 78 nursing mothers, those who consumed fenugreek seed tea reported increased milk supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies in that group showed improved growth in weight, length, and head circumference compared to those in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seed may also play a role in blood sugar balance. Another recent &lt;a href="https://www.foodandnutritionjournal.org/volume12number1/glycemic-index-lowering-effects-of-defatted-fenugreek-seed-flakes-fenuflakestm-on-some-indian-food-preparations-a-randomized-controlled-clinical-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; involving 62 people with type 2 diabetes showed that taking fenugreek powder twice daily for two months led to reduced blood glucose and body mass index. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe this effect comes from the seed’s high &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002136.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which can slow sugar absorption and blunt post-meal spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-improves-well-being"&gt;Improves well-being&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent bloating or other digestive troubles motivate many individuals to look for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-foods-promote-weight-loss-regardless-of-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant foods&lt;/a&gt; that are less burdensome. Fenugreek’s soluble fiber might soothe common issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can support the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87559120600586315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microbiota&lt;/a&gt; that line the gut, which may encourage both nutrient absorption and comfort after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many simply appreciate how fenugreek offers variety in the kitchen. Livening up everyday staples with an extra layer of flavor encourages healthy eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds might also suit those exploring legume-based diets, since fenugreek belongs to the same family as lentils and beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sensible-measures-and-professional-advice"&gt;Sensible measures and professional advice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy adults often do well with moderate amounts of fenugreek, but cautious steps are wise for some. If individuals have special conditions, it’s good to speak with a dietitian or physician before altering meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most find no problems when integrating fenugreek into a varied diet. A steady intake of these seeds can &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/archaeologists-find-hallucinogenic-seeds-in-ancient-bones-black-henbane/"&gt;complement&lt;/a&gt; a plan that includes quality proteins, vegetables, and fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes and those who train regularly sometimes find fenugreek beneficial due to its &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-high-protein-fruit-prunes-strengthens-muscles-and-bones-in-people-over-45/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high protein&lt;/a&gt; content. It’s considered a simple way to refuel muscles without an abrupt shift in meal routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding water-rich vegetables with fenugreek seeds can also enhance hydration, which is valuable during intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.16970" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Food Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 23:10:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQSjRjN282ZDZjRGdfRVVmbTFhYmcxamhmMDQxMFNsVm9kWEJ0c01Ka3dCbE94UWVJeFZ6WldIUkRPa0tNcGZUYWtzVG9GOUZJUlEtMElyREVERE1HMHRKZWY3UngtblZOejBJaXVKTTd2MWZBNVFvVzB0S3ptZmg3dndDd1JleU1OLWkzUmNEZV91TzhjdlVucHFfRQ</guid></item><item><title>犹他州卫生官员监测犹他州西南部潜在的麻疹暴露- KSL.com | Utah health officials monitoring potential measles exposure in southwestern Utah - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPTUM1MWRuRG04dTBHWGhFYWdxMTAyemk2QUFtaFpZMEg5VWlWeG13Ym1wWWZCanZmRGFpeW5laXhkQ1VQVjFrQ2FJZEFkRnJ0Y2ZXd21KbU9JN3NGRnVxLWtjNXhzU2hTYTVoSVh6S0lKMXF4OFVzWEJaM2NMVWJWclhLcldtNy0xN2F0TFB2dUlkdFFCMVdYVVNkeWNvUEhYLXZ6dkhubjVpMnZiZjJyV1NvS1c4WlJk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

In addition, we know they visited with unvaccinated individuals," the department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department said the risk to the general population is low, but it wants to inform the public of the "increased risk of measles in this region and the increasing number of cases in surrounding states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the department has limited details about who was exposed but is working to provide information and protection to those it can identify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Earlier incident&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest measles case follows closely on the heels of an earlier case that also entered the state last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case first came to light Monday during a Summit County Board of Health meeting. The state health department confirmed that the individual was vaccinated, significantly reducing the risk of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This individual had previously been vaccinated and posed a low risk of infection to others," the department said in a statement Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 19, an international traveler flew from Canada to Salt Lake City and rented a car to drive to southern Idaho. Utah health officials emphasized that the person did not make any stops in Utah before leaving the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the stay in Idaho, the individual became symptomatic and was diagnosed with measles, and all exposure concerns were in Idaho, according to the department. A few days later, the individual returned to Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On May 23, that same individual came back to Salt Lake, again didn't make any stops but did get on board an airplane while symptomatic," said Derek Moss, Summit County nursing director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department explained that the individual had been cleared by public health to fly, as they were deemed to have passed their infectious period before boarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake County health officials contacted passengers from the flight and provided resources to prevent infection and said, at this point, no additional measles infections have been reported among exposed passengers. Health officials continue to monitor those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's statement from the state health department said that due to the ongoing spread of measles cases throughout the country, public health and medical providers recommend the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to the increase in measles spread across North and South America, we encourage Utahns to talk to a pharmacist or health care provider to verify their vaccination status prior to summer travel," reads the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributing:&lt;/strong&gt; Shara Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people are quite concerned about the amount of radiation that comes with a CT scan.  Radiation can increase the risk of cancer down the line… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;but by how much?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" title="" target="_blank"&gt;A new study was published in &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; recently that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jwatch.org/na58693/2025/04/24/new-estimate-ct-scan-associated-cancer-risk" target="_blank"&gt;updates &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;our best estimates.  As a primary care doc I order my fair share of CT scans, but I always try to make them worth the risk for the patient.  Whenever possible and appropriate I will favor an ultrasound or MRI, but these options are not all equivalent in terms of what they can see, how fast they see it, and how often insurance companies will pay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so for this quick boost I’m going to efficiently review the risks of radiation from CT scans as reported in this most recent study.  Then we will briefly review CT versus MRI versus ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope you find this post both &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reassuring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;alarming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CT scan cancer risk study: key findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This comprehensive &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;analyzed cancer risks from the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;93 million CT scans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; performed on 62 million Americans in 2023 alone, providing updated estimates of radiation-induced cancer risks (using detailed radiation dose data and national utilization patterns).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Individual cancer risk per CT scan&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;absolute risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; of developing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;single CT scan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; varies dramatically by age:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infants (&amp;lt;1 year)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Little ones have the highest risk at approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 additional cancers per 1,000 CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (2% absolute risk). Infants under 1 year old have dramatically higher radiation-related cancer risks because their rapidly dividing cells are more susceptible to DNA damage from ionizing radiation, their small body surface area means they receive a higher radiation dose per unit of body weight during CT scans, and they have many more years of life ahead for radiation-induced cancers to develop and manifest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teenagers (15-17 years)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Much lower at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 cancers per 1,000 CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (0.2% absolute risk), but still more than any of us would like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Risk continues decreasing with age, though specific per-scan rates weren't provided for all adult age groups. The authors emphasize that the risk is highly variable and depends on multiple patient and examination factors.  And yet I decided to go there and I think this calculation from their data is a good ballpark:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;90 million adult CT scans in 2023 were projected to result in 93,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This yields approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.03 cancers per 1,000 adult CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These figures represent the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lifetime excess cancer risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a single CT examination, meaning the additional cancer cases beyond what would normally occur in the population.  This linear dose model suggests that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;risks are additive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; - meaning:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Relative risk context&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study authors offer a pretty sobering conclusion: if current CT practices continue, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT-associated cancers could account for 5% of all annual cancer diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the United States. This places CT radiation exposure on par with other significant cancer risk factors like alcohol consumption (5.4%) and excess body weight (7.6%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Cancer types and demographics&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common projected radiation-induced cancers are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lung cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 22,400 cases (70% in women due to higher radiation sensitivity)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colon cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 8,700 cases (59% in men)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leukemia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 7,900 cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bladder cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 7,100 cases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breast cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: 5,700 cases in women&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children face higher per-scan risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; but account for only 9,700 of the projected cancers due to lower CT utilization. Pediatricians and pediatric specialists really go out of their way to try other imaging techniques.  Perhaps we should all be doing this more vigorously for adult patients, but it’s tricky (see below).  The most common childhood cancers from CT exposure are estiamted to be thyroid (3,500 cases), lung (990 cases), and breast cancer (630 cases).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;High-risk examination types&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abdomen and pelvis CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; pose the greatest population risk, accounting for 37% of projected cancers (37,500 cases) despite representing 32% of examinations. This reflects the higher radiation doses from multi-phase scanning commonly used in these studies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Population-level impact&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study projects approximately &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;103,000 future lifetime cancers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (90% confidence interval: 96,400-109,500) will result &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;from CT scans performed in 2023 alone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Sensitivity analyses suggest this number could range from 80,000 to 127,000 cancers depending on various assumptions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This represents a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-4 fold increase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; from a similar 2009 analysis that projected 29,000 cancers from 2007 CT use. The increase stems from 30% higher utilization, improved dosimetry methods revealing higher actual radiation doses, and better accounting for multi-phase scanning techniques.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a radiologist, nor an oncologist.  I welcome any dissenting opinions or references.  But as a primary doc trying to keep up with the latest across multiple disciplines, this potential cancer risk as published in a respected journal is by necessity something I need to know, consider at the point of care, and report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Key implications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the discussion of this study emphasizes that CT scans are often lifesaving, the massive volume of use (93 million annually) means even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;small individual risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; translate to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;substantial population health impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The authors stress the critical importance of justifying each CT scan and optimizing radiation doses, particularly avoiding unnecessary multi-phase examinations when single-phase scanning would suffice diagnostically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need for continued efforts to reduce unnecessary CT utilization while maintaining the significant clinical benefits these examinations provide. Remembering to substitute ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging whenever possible is a good cancer-prevention tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;When CT scans are needed&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If it were simple, we would order nothing but MRIs and ultrasounds, as these tests do not use ionizing radiation (associated with DNA damage and slightly increased cancer risk).  So here is a quick primer for the layperson that might help in our next discussion with a doc who is about to pull the trigger on an imaging study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; are frequently chosen over radiation-free alternatives like &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; because they offer unique diagnostic advantages that often outweigh radiation concerns, particularly when evaluating abdominal pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; avoids radiation entirely, it has significant limitations in abdominal imaging due to interference from intestinal gas, operator dependence, and poor visualization through bone or air-filled structures. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MRI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, though excellent for soft tissue contrast and bowel evaluation with specialized techniques like MR enterography, requires 30-60 minutes to complete, may not be readily available in urgent situations, and can be limited by motion artifacts and patient factors like claustrophobia or metallic implants. MRIs often require days to get insurance company authorization, and are much more expensive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In contrast, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CT scans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; can comprehensively evaluate multiple organ systems within minutes, providing excellent visualization of bones, soft tissues, and bowel structures regardless of patient body weight or bowel gas. This speed and reliability make CT particularly valuable for detecting time-sensitive conditions like appendicitis, bowel obstruction, pulmonary embolism, or internal bleeding, where rapid diagnosis can be life-saving. If you are in the ER and need imaging, chances are a CT will be ordered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For patients with vague abdominal pain, like in primary care outpatient settings, CT's ability to simultaneously assess the liver, kidneys, pancreas, bowel, and other structures helps identify serious pathology that might present with non-specific symptoms, often providing definitive answers that guide immediate treatment decisions and avoid prolonged diagnostic uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;One sentence conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I hope this does not scare people into avoiding recommended CT scans, but rather gives some &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;individual reassurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;population-scale pause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, so that we can all be more thoughtful when getting that imaging study.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;--—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Among 343 participants, those who had taken classic psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin reported significantly lower anxiety and PTSD symptoms than those who used other substances or none at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that certain psychedelics may influence the brain’s processing of trauma, potentially offering insight into new treatment pathways. However, researchers caution that these results do not endorse unsupervised psychedelic use and call for more controlled studies to understand the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower PTSD Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; Classic psychedelics were linked to reduced anxiety and trauma symptoms in festival survivors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controlled Variables:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings held up after accounting for age, gender, psychiatric history, and prior use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution Emphasized:&lt;/strong&gt; Authors stress that this is not a call for recreational use but a prompt for further therapeutic research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Reichman University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A groundbreaking new study conducted by researchers from Reichman University and other Israeli institutions explored the psychological aftermath of the deadly terrorist attack at the Nova Festival in southern Israel. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack, which took place on October 7, 2023, claimed the lives of nearly 400 people and left hundreds more physically and psychologically wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110663"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg" alt="This shows people and a swirly background." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/psychedelics-PTSD-neuroscinc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study’s findings show that survivors who had used “classic” psychedelics — including hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin), LSD, mescaline, and 2C-B — reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms compared to those who had not used psychedelics or who had consumed other substances, such as MDMA, cannabis, or alcohol.

Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three weeks after the massacre, the researchers administered in-person psychological questionnaires to 343 survivors aged 18–64, examining the participants’ mental state, the psychoactive substances they consumed before and during the festival, and the ways those substances may have affected their physical and psychological response to trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the phenomenon of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety following exposure to war and terrorism is becoming an increasingly pressing global mental health concern, scientific understanding about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the development of these conditions remains partial and limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, most knowledge in the field is based on research in animal models, rather than on direct evidence from humans exposed to extreme traumatic events — especially not under the influence of mind-altering substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what makes the Nova Festival an exceptional event — it was a real-world situation, as opposed to a laboratory simulation, in which trauma and psychedelics intersected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings show that survivors who had used “classic” psychedelics — including hallucinogenic mushrooms (psilocybin), LSD, mescaline, and 2C-B — reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms compared to those who had not used psychedelics or who had consumed other substances, such as MDMA, cannabis, or alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results remained statistically significant even after controlling for factors such as age, gender, previous psychiatric history, and prior psychedelic use. For example, while the average anxiety symptom score across the entire sample was 1.90, it dropped to 1.38 among the survivors who had taken classic psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zohar Rubinstein of the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University said: “This is a powerful example of the simultaneous exposure of almost 4,000 people to a traumatic event on a massive scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The survivors’ willingness to cooperate with us during such a difficult time allowed us to examine the effects of psychedelics at a relatively early stage of symptom onset, and in a more natural setting (compared to therapeutic settings). These data are of great clinical importance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einat Karp Barnir, a clinical psychologist at the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University, said: “A few days after October 7th, I began volunteering as a clinical psychologist in a healing space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After dozens of conversations I had with survivors, I started to notice that some of those who had been under the influence of certain substances appeared to show milder symptoms — less anxiety and fewer post-traumatic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around the same time, I came across an article claiming that substance use could increase the post-traumatic stress of those who were at the Nova Festival. The discrepancy between what was being said in the media and what I was seeing on the ground sparked the idea for this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I contacted Dr. Zohar Rubinstein, and we decided to explore the connection between the type of substance taken at the party and the severity of psychological responses after the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At a time when understanding and treating trauma is more relevant than ever, there is still a lack of sufficient information about the factors that influence the formation of traumatic memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study sheds light on the differing effects of various substances and contributes to our understanding of how traumatic memories are formed and retained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such an understanding could one day not only improve treatment, but even help prevent the development of PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Rany Abend of the Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology at Reichman University said: “What the survivors have given us — through tremendous courage — is a unique glimpse into how mind-altering substances affect the formation of trauma, based on their personal experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main finding of our study indicates that the brain systems activated by classic psychedelics are involved in the connection between the experience of a life-threatening event, the formation of a traumatic memory, and the emergence of psychological symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds to a growing body of research on this important topic, provides new insights for researchers and therapists, and presents real-world evidence that the use of classic psychedelics may reduce trauma symptoms — an important finding with implications for both research and clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers emphasize the need for caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s findings are not intended to encourage the free and unsupervised use of psychedelics, nor do they suggest that such use constitutes a form of treatment,” Dr. Rubinstein clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather, they point to potential mechanisms — which need to be further investigated — that may explain how supervised use within an integrative psychological treatment setting may yield therapeutic benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and PTSD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p

responses 3 weeks after exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence indicates the therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds for post-traumatic stress, yet the mechanisms mediating their effects remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delineating the effect of psychedelics on traumatic memory formation could shed light on target therapeutic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report on 343 adult survivors of a single, large-scale terrorist attack taking place during a festival in which different psychedelic compounds were consumed, in whom levels of anxiety and post-traumatic symptoms were assessed 3 weeks following the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings indicated that those who were under the influence of classic psychedelics during the attack reported significantly lower levels of anxiety and post-traumatic responses compared to those who were under the influence of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and those who consumed no psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the protective effects of classic psychedelics for post-traumatic responses manifested more strongly among participants who did not consume additional recreational substances alongside psychedelics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that pharmacologic targets of classic psychedelics may modulate the formation of enduring trauma memories and confer a protective effect against the development of post-traumatic stress and anxiety responses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Put yourself […] in the mind of a 3-, 4-, or 5-year-old,” Oliver Burkeman instructs me. “You just get up every day, and you have no say. I mean, of course, you get some say, but you know what I mean? Where you live, where you’re going — you know that the plans are just completely outside of your control. Which, in a sense, is a very deep truth about the human condition, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this week’s &lt;a href="https://miniphilosophy.substack.com/"&gt;Mini Philosophy interview&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke with the best-selling author and philosopher Oliver Burkeman about his various books, all of which, in their way, explore human mortality and limits. In &lt;em&gt;4000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals&lt;/em&gt;, Burkeman makes the disarmingly stark point that we have only so many days on this planet. &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/thinking/rule-of-saint-benedict-oliver-burkemans/"&gt;We cannot do everything. We have to choose where and how to spend our time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our conversation, we paused to zoom in on a problem this finitude presents: How can we marry the ideas of mortality and limit with the human need to control things? We imagine ourselves immortal, but the world has a habit of reminding us we’re not. In spite of all the evidence, many people insist on struggling along with some vain, fruitless, and unhappy project to make sure everything goes a certain way. Endless choice. Unrestricted access. Knowledge. Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, where does that need come from, and is there a better way available to us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-need-to-control"&gt;The need to control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Burkeman pointed out, children have no problem being told what to do. I’m sure many parents or teachers are screaming at the screen, “You’ve not met my kids!” Still, most young children, especially, have normalized the idea that “grown-ups” will tell them what to do and give them what they need. The food in the fridge fills up miraculously, the TV just turns on with the click of a button, and “Mom, where are we going today?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hallmark of growing up is taking responsibility. And, as all Uncle Bens of the multiverse will tell you, when you have power, you have responsibility. As an adult gains control over those things previously handed to them by other adults, they feel anxious and stressed. As existentialists like Søren Kierkegaard and Jean-Paul Sartre pointed out, with control comes &lt;em&gt;ennui&lt;/em&gt;, angst, and analysis paralysis. Burkeman put it like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What happens, as you get older, is you start to exert control, or at least influence, or try to get into control of things. And then people get a lot of anxiety when they realize the limits to their control. People are very aware of their vulnerabilities, yet still want to exert control. There’s this anxiety that comes from realizing you’re fragile and finite, yet you keep trying to manage or control that fragility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like some insatiably voracious wolf, we gorge ourselves on more and more control, and groan under the indigestible weight of its inadequacy. And along the way, we forget what simple, calm happiness there is in not being in control. We forget that limits have their comfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-limited-life"&gt;A limited life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the answer to this? Of course, we cannot become children again. The bills need to be paid, that toothache needs fixing, and the fridge won’t fill itself. We cannot flop on the couch and call for Mom to bring us a snack. Nor should we live a life free of morality and responsibility. Our actions matter. We can control and change things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burkeman offers two points here. The first is to reclaim what the word “meaning” means. Over several millennia, a “meaningful life” was often defined in relation to God or some religious ideal. In a modern, secular age, it’s come to be defined as changing the world in a great, sweeping, “I’m going to get a statue” reform. But as Burkeman told me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these implicit definitions of meaning are being smuggled in where it can’t possibly be meaningful to cook dinner for your son or volunteer at some local organization because you’re only helping a few people, and in a millennium, no one will ever know they even existed. To me, that’s just a strange and unhelpful definition of meaning. So, why can’t it be meaningful? Why can’t something be meaningful to do just because it doesn’t become a sort of permanent fixture of the time-space continuum forever or something?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-dancing-monk"&gt;The dancing monk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burkeman’s second point concerns how we can find the balance between anxiously needing to control everything and a despairing, hopeless quietism that says, “&lt;em&gt;Que sera sera&lt;/em&gt;” to absolutely everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a third way, and Burkeman gives me an example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine three people dancing at a wedding. First, there is the child. The child twirls around, giggling and jumping, with the insouciant joy of one who has never been shamed. Dancing is fun, and so they dance. Second, there is a 30-something groomsman who shuffles awkwardly about the dance floor, nervously trying to look cool. Small step to the left. Small step to the right. Safe and inoffensive. Third, there is the dancing monk. They are dancing with the happy abandon of the child, but not from immaturity; rather, with the mature, intellectual recognition that they cannot change other people’s perceptions. The monk knows two things: “I like dancing,” and “I cannot make people like or dislike me.” And so, they dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, for Burkeman, is what a happy life means. It’s one that lives in the joyful space between control and passivity. It’s one that recognizes limits and lives with them. It’s jumping into the boxed walls of the sandpit to make castles and cities. Happiness is a monk dancing at a wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

Regional estimates were based on states with high (Arizona and California), low (Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and Washington), or unknown (all other states and Washington, DC) endemicity from January 2022 to July 2024. They also consulted a sample of 17 coccidioidomycosis experts (12 clinicians and 5 public health officials).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The number of cases is likely substantially higher than the nationally reported total, as surveillance does not capture patients who do not seek medical care or who are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The number of cases is likely substantially higher than the nationally reported total, as surveillance does not capture patients who do not seek medical care or who are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed," the researchers wrote. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Each year, approximately 10,000 to 20,000 cases are reported through US national surveillance, doubling from 8,232 cases in 2014 to 20,003 cases in 2019," they added. "However, coccidioidomycosis is only reportable in 28 states and Washington, DC, and these totals likely represent only a fraction of the true national burden of coccidioidomycosis." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caused by spores in disturbed soil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coccidioidomycosis is caused by inhaling spores of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coccidioides&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; fungus in the soil, mainly in the southwestern United States and parts of Washington state, Mexico, and Central and South America. Outbreaks of the disease are rare and typically occur after weather events that disturb the soil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While many infected people have no symptoms, three-quarters have activity-limiting pneumonia symptoms (eg, cough, fever, fatigue), which last for a few weeks to months, and the infection can result in severe or long-term illness or systemic infections in rare cases. These symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to pneumonia, delaying treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most cases resolve on their own, but people with severe infections are given antifungal drugs and usually recover fully. Each year, direct medical costs and productivity losses in the United States are estimated at $385 million. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic accuracy depended on endemicity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The models estimated that 273,000 (95% credible interval [CrI], 206,000 to 360,000) symptomatic coccidioidomycosis cases occurred in 2019—10 to 18 times the number identified through surveillance—as well as 18,000 to 28,000 associated hospitalizations and 700 to 1100 deaths in 2019.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;States with high coccidioidomycosis endemicity had the greatest burden (125,000 cases), followed by states with unknown endemicity (103,000) and the least-endemic states (46,000). The cases led to an estimated 23,000 annual hospitalizations (95% CrI, 18,000 to 28,000) and 900 deaths (95% CrI, 700 to 1,100).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Based on values obtained through the expert panel, the researchers estimated that 30% of people with symptomatic uncomplicated coccidioidomycosis and 99% of those with severe infections sought healthcare. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The proportion of patients seeking healthcare who were diagnosed accurately for uncomplicated disease depended on state endemicity (high endemicity, 38%; low endemicity, 20%; unknown endemicity, 8%) and severe disease (high endemicity, 80%; low endemicity, 45%; unknown endemicity, 25%).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Highly endemic states made up half of all estimated hospitalizations (12,000), while 7,000 and 4,000 hospitalizations were estimated in states with unknown endemicity and low endemicity, respectively.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need for better education, testing, reporting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The authors estimated that 7 people per 100,000 were hospitalized nationwide: 26 per 100,000 in highly endemic states; 9 per 100,000 in states with low endemicity; and 3 per 100,000 in states with unknown endemicity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These findings suggest that coccidioidomycosis burden estimates substantially exceed nationally reported case counts, highlighting the need for improved awareness, education, diagnostic testing practices, and reporting to inform public health efforts and achieve better patient outcomes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most estimated deaths occurred in highly endemic states (500), followed by states with unknown endemicity (300) and those with low-endemicity (200). The team estimated 0.3 deaths per 100,000 people nationally, with regional rates of 1.1 per 100,000 in highly endemic states, 0.4 per 100,000 in states with low endemicity, and 0.1 per 100,000 in states with unknown endemicity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The expert panel estimated that 32% of accurately diagnosed coccidioidomycosis cases were reported to public health officials in low-endemic states and that 13% were reported in states with unknown endemicity. Based on a comparison of Arizona surveillance data and serologic lab testing data, an estimated 80% of accurately diagnosed patients were reported to public health officials in highly endemic states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;These findings suggest that coccidioidomycosis burden estimates substantially exceed nationally reported case counts, highlighting the need for improved awareness, education, diagnostic testing practices, and reporting to inform public health efforts and achieve better patient outcomes," the authors concluded. "Improved routine surveillance, enhanced surveillance projects, and targeted studies are essential to produce more reliable multipliers from primary data." &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That accounted for about 95 percent of Hickman Farms' bird population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CEO Glenn Hickman held a press conference on May 30 to address the situation. To him, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14530151/government-high-alert-bird-flu-warning-death-sheep.html"&gt;the loss was entirely preventable&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If our pullets had been vaccinated when we started lobbying the federal government in January, our pullets would have been saved by now,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman and Hickman Family farms have been advocating for access to avian &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-8f4ed850-417a-11f0-bc8b-09207515360b"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccines since January.&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hickmanseggs.com/notification/"&gt; According to the company's website&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses the situation, the U.S. government makes a vaccine, but only uses it as an export.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'European countries have now been vaccinating their flocks for a couple of years and are gaining the upper hand on controlling this disease. That vaccine is actually made here in the U.S., but we export to other countries while our flocks go unprotected.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The site encourages customers to contact their representatives in a continued push for access to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CEO Glenn Hickman said that the tragic loss of millions of his chickens was preventable &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Hickman's Family Farms plant, one of the biggest egg producers in the country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'The quicker we can start vaccinating our nation's poultry flock, the quicker we can get back to normalized operations,' said Hickman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman Farms is just the largest of several that have been affected in Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On June 2, the Arizona Department of Agriculture confirmed that another farm in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area was placed under quarantine. The farm still remains unnamed, but per their press release, poultry began showing symptoms on May and tested positive on May 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hickman farms took similar measures to prevent spread, but now is focused on repopulating their farm. According to Hickman, the process of de-populating, cleaning and re-populating will take almost two years. They process will begin in just a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the mean time, Hickman Farms has stopped operations. Hundreds of their 850 employees are out of the job - many of whom are contract workers and inmates. Fortunately, some employees will still be needed during the cleaning process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Customers of Hickman farms and other affected farms in Arizona do not need to be worried about &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14658491/Symptoms-bird-flu-pandemic-america-warning.html"&gt;contracting bird flu through consumption&lt;/a&gt;. The AZDA wrote in a press release on May 20 that eggs from chickens who tested positive have not entered food supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There have been no signs of illness in humans,' they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Consumers in Arizona and around the nation can remain confident in the safety and quality of eggs and egg products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Chickens inside Hickman's Family Farms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to CDC numbers, only 70 human cases of bird flu have been reported in the past 14 months, including one death. The AZDA and the CDC said that humans at highest risk are those who have worked directly with affected poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the outbreak, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.azfamily.com/2025/05/30/hickmans-family-farms-loses-95-arizona-chickens-bird-flu/"&gt;Arizona's Family &lt;/a&gt;reports that for the first time in 81  Hickman Farms will be unable to satisfy all of their customer demand. The company is looking for alternative ways to meet their needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone is upset about the decline in operations. 12 News reports that nearby residents are happy to be rid of the stench that comes with operating a chicken farm. &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/hickmans-family-farms-sued-in-federal-court"&gt;According to Fox 10&lt;/a&gt;, locals and environmental activists sued Hickman Farms in 2018 for polluting the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily Mail reached out to Hickman Family Farms and the Arizona Department of Agriculture for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The Southwest Utah Public Health Department includes Beaver, Garfield, Iron, Kane and Washington counties.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said anyone showing signs of measles should avoid going out into the public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We encourage anyone who has measles-like symptoms to stay at home and away from others for at least 4 days after the rash appears to limit the risk to others in their community," they said. "People who have symptoms should call medical facilities and clinics before they go in to make sure the clinic can protect other patients from potentially being exposed to the measles virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said symptoms could appear as many as 10 to 14 days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Common symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, red or watery eyes and tiny white spots that appear inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek (Koplik’s spots). A rash with small red spots generally begins 3-5 days after other signs of the illness starts," they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first possible case of measles in Utah was reported Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said a traveler flew into the Salt Lake City International Airport before renting a car and driving to Idaho before their symptoms developed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said the case “presented a very limited risk to our community," but they recommended Utahs check their vaccination status before traveling over the summer because of the increased number of cases across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Aubree B.

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://sinclair.hms.harvard.edu/people/kelly-rich"&gt;Kelly Rich&lt;/a&gt; was at Ohio State, her research into ALS and other neuromuscular diseases was promising enough to win her a career training award from the National Institute for Aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike federal grants that are tied to specific institutions, the training award is intended to support young researchers as they complete doctoral studies and transition from student to independent scientist, so Rich could have taken the grant anywhere. She chose the &lt;a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt; lab of &lt;a href="https://sinclair.hms.harvard.edu/people/david-sinclair"&gt;David Sinclair&lt;/a&gt; because of his reputation for work that flips on its head conventional thinking around aging and disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the health threats we fear the most, including heart disease, cancer, and dementia, occur more frequently with age. Medical research has answered or is striving to answer the most pressing questions about these conditions: What goes wrong in the body, how that malfunction translates into disease, and how we can fight back.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sinclair looks at the situation more broadly: If the risk of a given condition rises with age, what is it about aging that increases the risk? His reasoning is that if we can find the answer to that question, we might be able to lower the risk of several diseases at once.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers in his and other labs have made progress toward that goal in recent years. In 2020, Sinclair and colleagues — supported in part by the National Institutes of Health and NASA — made the cover of the journal Nature after they &lt;a href="https://masseyeandear.org/news/press-releases/2020/12/hms-scientists-reverse-age-related-vision-loss-eye-damage-from-glaucoma-in-mice"&gt;turned back the cellular clock&lt;/a&gt; in the optic nerves of lab mice. The team restored the neurons’ ability to generate new axons — the connection between the eye and the brain — and repaired vision in mice with glaucoma and in older mice whose vision was fading with age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the eye’s nerve cells are the same type as neurons in the brain, the work attracted Rich to Harvard. She believes the approach used to reinvigorate the mouse optic nerve holds promise as a way to fight currently incurable conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mda.org/disease/spinal-muscular-atrophy"&gt;spinal muscular atrophy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, however, her work has hit a roadblock. Rich, Sinclair, and other researchers across campus received grant termination notices linked to the government’s campaign to force Harvard to comply with proposed changes to governance and hiring, as well as audits of faculty and student viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re all just looking at each other going, ‘What the hell just happened?’ and it’s slowly sinking in,” Sinclair said. “We’re really trying to be supportive to our lab members, the students who’ve staked their lives on this, and the postdocs, who are the ones most likely to be let go. It’s extremely terrifying for them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sinclair’s lab lost two major grants — a five-year, $1.5 million grant that provides its financial foundation and Rich’s career award of $438,000 over six years, which funds her salary plus a technician to support her research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m still letting the dust settle a bit,” Rich said. “This is an especially tough moment for early career scientists and postdocs and students. The effect of these cuts is to take early career scientists who want to be the next generation of academic leaders and erode their confidence, their trust in the infrastructure that has driven science and science careers. Academia looks very different today.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The termination of Sinclair’s R01 grant — the NIH funding that supports his lab — casts his entire research program into doubt. He thinks that he has enough resources to avoid layoffs for a few months, but he has been scrambling to find private grants to replace federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m traveling around the country and the world to see if I can raise money to keep going and it’s just a race against time,” he said. “I can keep going for a while, maybe a few months, but ultimately, we relied on government money. So I’m looking for support from companies and the public to replace what was lost.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the unsettled environment, Rich said she’s intent on not making “snap decisions” about her next steps. Her preference is to continue to work with Sinclair and move on to an academic career, but she’s also not averse to transitioning toward an industry role, especially with the longstanding research partnership between the federal government and higher ed now in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to stick with where I am for as long as I can right now,” she said. “But I don’t think you can ignore the fact that it seems tougher now than ever to start a lab in academia, given that the infrastructure of federal funding so many early career professors rely on is largely gone. I haven’t made any decisions, but these are things that you can’t ignore. You have to be practical when you’re making decisions about that next step.”&lt;/p&gt;

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;OGDEN — Health officials in Weber and Morgan counties are asking residents to make sure their pets' vaccinations are up to date and to avoid touching bats or other wild animals after a bat found in Morgan County tested positive for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bats play an important role in our ecosystem and the majority of the bats in our population are healthy and tend to keep to themselves," said Amy Carter, communicable disease nurse with the Weber-Morgan Health Department. "However, if you see one in the daylight, or if it's in a place where you or your pet can pick it up, there's a good chance it is ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week's positive test is the Beehive State's first report of a rabies-positive bat in 2025. Carter added that as the weather warms, the chances for coming across a rabid animal increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabies is a virus that impacts the brain and nervous system of infected animals and can be fatal if not treated properly and promptly — which includes pre-exposure vaccination for pets and post-exposure vaccinations for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization, rabies spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through bites, scratches or direct contact with mucosa (eyes, mouth, or open wounds). Feces, blood and urine do not transmit rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Utah, bats are the most common carriers of the rabies virus. Skunks, raccoons, foxes and unvaccinated cats and dogs can also carry the disease, but Utah law requires cats and dogs to be vaccinated for rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Weber-Morgan Health Department provided the following tips when it comes to rabies prevention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your pet's vaccinations up to date. Check the pet's vaccination status with your veterinarian and put your records where you can access them quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from wild animals. Call your local animal control for assistance if it appears sick, injured or is acting strangely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act quickly if you are bitten or scratched by a bat or other wild animal. Immediately wash the wound with soap and water and see your health care provider. If possible, safely contain the bat and contact the Utah Division of Wildlife Services so it can be tested for rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report any interactions with a bat found in a sleeping area. Any exposure to a bat in a sleeping area is considered an exposure due to their ability to spread the virus through extremely small bites or scratches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is important because it is how we prevent rabies in our cats and dogs. It saves time and heartache if your pet is involved in a biting incident or comes in contact with a rabid bat or other animal," Carter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Oct. 2024, a bat in Pioneer Park &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51147132" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;tested positive for rabies&lt;/a&gt;, and Salt Lake County health officials said it was handled "potentially for an extended period," likely by multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information about bats, animals and rabies can be found &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/rabies/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Since 2019, he has been the CDC’s deputy director of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I think I can do more for the public’s health outside of the federal government at this time,” he said Tuesday about his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In an interview, Butler apologized for being somewhat vague about why he left the CDC. Butler said that “it’s time to move on and do something else.” But he added: “I think when you look at why is it time, you can see what’s going on across the federal government as well as I can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He did not directly criticize the CDC’s current leadership, or say there was a specific decision under the second Trump administration that drove him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler did, however, express concern about recent mass firings at the CDC and guidance for &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2025/05/27/kennedy-says-covid-vaccines-will-no-longer-be-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2025/05/27/kennedy-says-covid-vaccines-will-no-longer-be-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/#:~:text=Workers%20across%20the%20Centers%20for,health%20issues%20beyond%20that%20remit." target="_blank" rel=""&gt;over 2,400 employees&lt;/a&gt; at the CDC were slated to be fired, according to national news reports.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Butler said a lot of experience and expertise was lost at the agency. Younger employees, “inspired by the mission of public health,” were often the first to be fired, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We’ve lost a lot of good people. And truly assets to our nation have been lost. And I think that’s most unfortunate,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc/index.html"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is protecting America from diseases and other threats to public health. Butler said it was a “joy” to work there. He said the CDC “is just an incredible blessing to our country and to the entire world.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=182 274w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=266 400w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=511 768w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=682 1024w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/JF4AATEHDRALHCDU2YRZSQFVXQ.jpg?auth=dfb5e803d150ab1affdb6c42974ee649e6f9f226a5ee7b3bfd0f557ed1e57d0e&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=959 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jay Butler, Alaska’s Chief Medical Officer, speaks on stage with U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy during the Wellness Summit at the Glenn Massay Theater on Thursday, Aug. 4, 2016. The summit was convened by Senator Dan Sullivan to address the opioid epidemic. (Loren Holmes / Alaska Dispatch News) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He said also that “no agency is perfect” and that the past few years have been “challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Asked whether, in his view, there had been examples of problematic political interference at the CDC under the second Trump administration, Butler declined to say. However, he was critical of vaccination guidance from the man now overseeing the CDC and other federal health agencies, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a vaccine skeptic who has long amplified &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/12/05/health-care-group-targets-alaska-sen-murkowski-in-effort-to-block-rfk-jr-as-health-secretary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.adn.com/politics/2024/12/05/health-care-group-targets-alaska-sen-murkowski-in-effort-to-block-rfk-jr-as-health-secretary/"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; about immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I don’t understand some of what is being called science or being called ethics,” Butler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last week, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2025/05/27/kennedy-says-covid-vaccines-will-no-longer-be-recommended-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the COVID-19 vaccine will no longer be recommended for pregnant women or healthy children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler said he was particularly “puzzled” by that decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“There’s quite a bit of data that supports the safety of COVID vaccines during pregnancy. So that’s one where I think many of us are scratching our heads,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler said that he worked early in his career on HIV/AIDS prevention at the CDC. A well-regarded HIV program, credited with saving &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/an-update-on-pepfar-reauthorization/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/an-update-on-pepfar-reauthorization/"&gt;26 million lives&lt;/a&gt;, needs be reauthorized but is currently in limbo. Butler expressed concerns about that and a deteriorating focus on HIV transmission in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We’re not looking at a bright future in terms of HIV control,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In late May, a juvenile in Anchorage &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2025/05/22/anchorage-resident-tests-positive-for-measles-as-health-officials-warn-of-broader-exposure/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;tested positive for measles&lt;/a&gt;. That followed &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/nation-world/2025/05/13/the-us-has-over-1000-measles-cases-and-11-states-with-active-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;1,000 cases of the virus&lt;/a&gt; being reported across 11 states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The CDC currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; on its website that “a highly effective vaccination program” led to the elimination of measles in 2000 in the U.S. However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/opinions/national-opinions/2025/05/07/opinion-rfk-jrs-measles-strategy-is-leading-the-us-down-a-dark-path/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.adn.com/opinions/national-opinions/2025/05/07/opinion-rfk-jrs-measles-strategy-is-leading-the-us-down-a-dark-path/"&gt;has been criticized&lt;/a&gt; for not strongly endorsing vaccines as a way to prevent measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler said the measles vaccine has had “an excellent track record” for decades. He suggested that could, counterintuitively, be part of the problem for public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We’re the victim of our own success. When we’re doing our job well, we’re not in the headlines and people forget. We see that now with measles. We certainly could see it with polio. Things that used to terrify us, we think don’t exist anymore,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler said he told the CDC in February he was going to resign. His last day was May 3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=274&amp;amp;height=182 274w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=266 400w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=768&amp;amp;height=511 768w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=1024&amp;amp;height=682 1024w, https://www.adn.com/resizer/v2/72BYUIWVKBBENMTYWGPNHODOFE.jpg?auth=a1dd20187e46efe20ff7ff41afd61242d6095bbc4c31a435cac249347aea22c7&amp;amp;width=1440&amp;amp;height=959 1440w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Jay Butler, Deputy Director for Infectious Diseases addresses the media about response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus, inside the Emergency Operations Center at The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Thursday, Feb. 13, 2020, in Atlanta.

He said that he moved back to Anchorage with the anticipation that he would be working “on readiness and outbreak response issues” with public health agencies in Asia and the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler declined to say who is set to replace him at the CDC. But he said he was “absolutely” happy with the federal agency’s choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He was succeeded by &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2024/02/17/dr-anne-zink-to-resign-as-alaskas-chief-medical-officer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2024/02/17/dr-anne-zink-to-resign-as-alaskas-chief-medical-officer/"&gt;Dr. Anne Zink&lt;/a&gt; as Alaska’s chief medical officer in 2019. He said it’s a similar situation now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“I love leaving a job when I know the person who is taking it will do a better job than I do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Butler is planning on taking the summer off before looking for other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“For at least the short foreseeable future, I like to say it’s the three F’s: family, friends and fish,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:article-html-block-G33YF5JFARH4VOD7MKVJM6FLRE" data-fusion-component="article-html-block-G33YF5JFARH4VOD7MKVJM6FLRE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="adn-article-body__html"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:article-html-block-G33YF5JFARH4VOD7MKVJM6FLRE" data-fusion-component="article-html-block-G33YF5JFARH4VOD7MKVJM6FLRE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Anchorage Daily News</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 19:22:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNUjRCaFJlWUVid0lHM2pHOEI2Uk5Ldjl1cjlXT0VLRzFEaGwxU01aR29jOEhmYUoxdjR5MXV0UEFqRjhFMTA5V2ZmemIzU3JlUkQxNTFIbE5JVElrdXdrcHc5NWJZYk5DZFh4MjVtbVBPakJuUWwxcWRwRWdhMkIzX1BzZFB4eVc3OXdaOXRfS0F6NkpucTNreWE2M3BUQ19ZdWtsa2xTMGI2ZDduRFZnNmdQQXhLQU1FZERlRWs3SWw3TF9Qai1LWU5xOFFNT0k</guid></item><item><title>在我们年轻人和不断变化的文化的带领下，吸烟率降至有史以来的最低水平-好消息网络 | Smoking Rates Fall to Lowest Ever, Led by Our Young People and a Changing Culture - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxQbWJIbzFJNjhYRGM4UFlSd2lqb3RTN3JJbEN6U2RtNkxIUjF2SXZiZEwtS0MtWUVLbzUtb2ZrTDB6VjhaVjNSVFg1VU5NZHk1ckcyUDRVSjZyaFhfRUxfSGUxWHZTbTU2a0d6RTJrTl8tOXk1VGhQMDlLRHYtekQza2V1UGg5QTVVeUdiazRmbXY2RU5NbUU5bVE5RkozN0loRTBCemtfajVLYXdqclc5cGdnWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two national smoking surveys in the UK and the US which both concluded last October show that smoking rates are among the lowest ever observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national smoking rates in the US based on a survey of 1.77 million people and 54,000 households are falling across the board, with the largest declines seen in America’s youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Places with historically lower rates of smoking saw more modest declines, while areas with higher rates saw the most dramatic declines. Seniors and those aged over 50 though were quitting at significantly slower rates than youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833289" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; reported in a JAMA study&lt;/a&gt; with data collected from 1992 to 2022 to establish nonlinear trendlines that could be projected out into 2035 for the sake of informing health policy state-by-state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published this April, the study’s lead author, Dr. Matthew Stone, an assistant professor at UC San Diego, said that the national smoking prevalence is predicted via this data to fall below 5% by 2035 on a national level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-by-state, California, Utah, Hawaii, and Colorado are even projected to be significantly under the recommended target of 5% prevalence by that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rapid decline in smoking among young adults is clear evidence that the smoking epidemic will come to an end in our lifetime,” &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/young-adults-lead-dramatic-decline-in-smoking-rates/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tandem the UK has also made great progress, with smoking rates &lt;a href="https://ash.org.uk/media-centre/news/press-releases/new-government-smoking-figures-reveal-young-adults-have-seen-biggest-falls-in-smoking-rates-over-the-last-decade" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hovering around&lt;/a&gt; 11.5% nationally, and sitting even lower among 18-24 year-olds (9.8%). This equates to just 6 million adult smokers out of a population of 68 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POSITIVE TRENDS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question—’Do you have a history of smoking’—is almost always included on medical forms and during examinations and doctor’s visits. As a variable, it must be controlled for in all studies on the impacts of any activity on human health for the work to be considered seriously rigorous science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because smoking is linked to the incidence of and/or the worsening of virtually every major killer in the West, including cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks who are or have been non-habitual smokers or who can start and stop whenever they want may find the characterization of smoking as an “epidemic” slightly harsh, but the impact that commercial tobacco cigarette usage has had on national health systems and individuals and their families is so significant as to be unquantifiable.&lt;/p&gt;

Thyroid hormone signaling in the amygdala—the part of the brain involved in processing emotions—was not only activated by fear learning, but also necessary for storing fear memories. Boosting thyroid hormone activity strengthened fear memories, while blocking it impaired them. These results may help uncover new treatment pathways for trauma-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is known to be essential for learning to associate danger with a particular stimulus—such as a tone paired with a shock in laboratory settings. This process, known as Pavlovian fear conditioning, has long been used in animal research to study the brain’s response to threat. Meanwhile, the thyroid hormone system has traditionally been associated with metabolism and early brain development. But it is increasingly being linked to mood, anxiety, and memory. Still, researchers have had limited understanding of how thyroid hormones influence the adult brain’s ability to store emotionally significant memories—especially in brain regions like the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thyroid hormones such as triiodothyronine (T3) interact with specific receptors in the brain called thyroid hormone receptors (TRs). These receptors act as transcriptional regulators: when they bind to T3, they turn on genes that help regulate brain plasticity—the brain’s ability to adapt based on experience. In their unbound state, these receptors suppress gene activity. This dual function makes them a promising target for exploring how hormones can shape emotional learning at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the research team focused on mice undergoing fear conditioning. The study used a widely accepted experimental procedure: mice were exposed to a tone followed by a mild foot shock, creating an association between the two. Researchers examined whether genes involved in the thyroid hormone pathway were activated in the amygdala following this learning event. They also tested whether directly manipulating thyroid hormone activity in the amygdala would influence fear memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved several sets of experiments. In one, the researchers surgically implanted tiny cannulas into the amygdala of adult male mice. These cannulas allowed them to precisely deliver thyroid hormone T3 or a TR antagonist—either before or after the mice experienced tone-shock pairings. The goal was to observe whether adding or blocking hormone signaling in this brain region would enhance or impair the consolidation of fear memories, which is the process by which short-term memories become stable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that administering T3 directly into the amygdala led to stronger fear memories, as measured by increased freezing behavior when the tone was later played. In contrast, blocking thyroid receptors with an antagonist drug weakened fear memory. These changes were not due to differences in how mice learned during the training session itself, but rather reflected how well they retained the memory afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In additional experiments, the researchers created a hypothyroid state in mice by feeding them a low-iodine diet combined with a chemical that blocks thyroid hormone production. As expected, these mice showed lower levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. They also had impaired fear memory. Remarkably, the researchers were able to reverse this memory deficit by injecting T3 into the amygdala, confirming that local hormone signaling in this specific brain region was enough to rescue the behavioral impairment caused by systemic hormone deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined which specific genes in the amygdala were regulated by thyroid hormones during fear learning. Using a technique called quantitative PCR, they identified several genes whose activity levels changed following fear conditioning. These included both genes that are usually activated by T3 (such as Dio2 and Reln) and genes that are typically suppressed (such as Trh and Aldh1a3). These transcriptional changes were consistent with the idea that thyroid hormones help coordinate the brain’s molecular response to threat, priming it for storing emotional memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a type of imaging called RNAscope to validate that some of these genes were being turned on in the amygdala itself, not in nearby regions. They also confirmed that these changes happened within hours of fear learning, suggesting a direct link between hormone signaling and the early phases of memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond memory, the researchers also tested how amygdala thyroid hormone activity influenced anxiety-related behaviors. In a separate open field test, mice given T3 in the amygdala spent less time exploring the center of the arena and showed less movement overall. These behaviors suggest an increase in anxiety-like responses, aligning with the idea that thyroid hormones can influence emotional arousal beyond memory alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study provides strong evidence that the thyroid hormone system is a dynamic and influential player in the adult brain’s emotional memory network. While past research has linked thyroid dysfunction to mood disorders like depression and anxiety, this study offers a direct mechanism by which thyroid hormones affect how emotionally significant events are encoded and remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also raise intriguing possibilities for clinical research. Thyroid hormone levels are not routinely measured in patients with PTSD or trauma-related symptoms, despite known associations between stress and thyroid function. If future research supports these findings in humans, thyroid hormone regulation could become a target for novel therapies aimed at preventing or modifying fear-related memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study has limitations. All of the experiments were conducted in male mice, leaving open questions about whether the same results would apply to females. The researchers also focused on relatively short time frames, mainly testing memory 24 hours after learning. It remains unclear how long the observed effects of T3 or its antagonists last, or how these hormone pathways interact with other known regulators of memory such as serotonin, dopamine, or stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work could explore whether the same hormone pathways are involved in more chronic or generalized anxiety, and whether targeting these pathways could improve treatment outcomes in individuals with trauma-related disorders. Researchers may also investigate how early life stress interacts with thyroid signaling in the brain, potentially helping to explain why some individuals are more vulnerable to the long-term effects of trauma than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-024-02679-2" target="_blank"&gt;Evidence for thyroid hormone regulation of amygdala dependent fear-relevant memory and plasticity&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Stephanie A.

But behind that burst of energy lies a potent mix of &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-does-caffeine-do-to-your-body-11717701" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt;, sugar, and stimulants that can raise your blood pressure and negatively affect your health.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Caffeine can temporarily raise blood pressure by blocking &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/adenosine-and-sleep-3015337" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adenosine&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical that helps relax blood vessels,” said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDCES, a cardiology dietitian at &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Entirely Nourished&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When that happens, blood vessels constrict instead of dilate. This process triggers the nervous system to release stress hormones like adrenaline, which causes the heart to beat faster and the blood pressure to climb.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This rise in blood pressure is usually temporary in healthy adults. Energy drinks typically increase systolic blood pressure (the top number) by 5 to 15 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure by 5 to 10 mmHg within an hour of consumption, said &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/aaron-j-feingold/1314979" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Aaron Feingold, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist at JFK University Medical Center.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For people with existing hypertension or other cardiovascular concerns, the effects may be more dangerous, especially if you’re drinking energy drinks every day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Regular consumers may develop tolerance to some acute effects, but chronic elevation of baseline blood pressure often persists,” said Feingold. “The high sugar content contributes to insulin resistance and weight gain, both independent risk factors for hypertension.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine levels in energy drinks can vary between 80 and 350 milligrams (mg) per serving, depending on the brand and size, said Routhenstein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For comparison, a standard 8-ounce &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-much-caffeine-is-in-a-cup-of-coffee-8584205" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cup of coffee&lt;/a&gt; contains about 100 mg of caffeine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That means one energy drink could contain the same&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;caffeine as an espresso or more than three cups of coffee.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This wide variation is concerning because many consumers are unaware of the exact caffeine content they're consuming, and serving sizes are often larger than standard measurements used in caffeine research,” said Feingold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Energy drinks also have synthetic caffeine that may be absorbed more quickly than natural caffeine from coffee, Feingold added.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-ingredients-can-amplify-caffeines-effects"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Ingredients Can Amplify Caffeine's Effects &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Energy drinks typically contain more than just caffeine. “Many contain additional stimulants like taurine, guarana, and ginseng that can amplify caffeine's effects on the cardiovascular system,” said Feingold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Routhenstein, the combination of these stimulants and high sugar content can contribute to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-high-blood-pressure-7562377" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;elevated blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. “Because energy drinks vary widely in caffeine and stimulant content—and due to their potential health risks—there is no universally safe amount to consume daily,” said Routhenstein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, health organizations like the FDA recommend a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/caffeine-overdose-5219790" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maximum of 400 milligrams&lt;/a&gt; of caffeine per day for healthy adults—roughly the amount in four small cups of coffee.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One or two energy drinks can easily exceed that limit, especially when combined with other caffeinated beverages throughout the day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, “from a cardiovascular safety standpoint, I recommend no more than one energy drink per day, and preferably none,” said Feingold.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For healthy adults without cardiovascular risk factors, occasional consumption (two to three times per week maximum) of standard-sized energy drinks may be acceptable," he added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new study has found a startling link between chronic cannabis use and increased risk of cardiovascular disease—regardless of whether you smoke it or consume edibles. The finding challenges commonly held beliefs about the health impacts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which many see as a relatively harmless drug—especially when ingested.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study, published Wednesday, May 28 in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2834540?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2025.1399"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, found that THC smokers suffer from significantly worse artery function than non-users. They observed the same effect in edible consumers, though their arteries were not as severely affected. In either case, vascular function was reduced by roughly half compared to those who do not use cannabis, according to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/05/430051/whether-its-smoking-or-edibles-marijuana-bad-your-heart"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Scientifically, this THC result is really interesting but boy does it screw up the public health messaging,’” co-author Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at UCSF, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/cannabis/article/ucsf-cannabis-heart-health-risks-20349621.php"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reportedly said to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lead author and UCSF physician-scientist Leila Mohammadi when he saw the data. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These results add to a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/cannabis-use-marijuana-surgery-anesthesia-study-1849966607"&gt;&lt;span&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that suggests long-term weed use can lead to cardiovascular damage and life-threatening events such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/synthetic-weed-may-cause-heart-attacks-but-its-tough-t-5926944"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart attacks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and strokes, though experts still lack consensus on its precise impacts. A 2024 study published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.123.030178"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; found that people who consume cannabis daily had a 25% increased risk of heart attack and a 42% increased risk of stroke compared to non-users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For this new study, researchers investigated how cannabis impacts vascular function. To isolate the effects of chronic cannabis use, they recruited 55 otherwise healthy adults aged 18 to 50 who did not use any form of nicotine and were not frequently exposed to secondhand smoke. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These participants were sorted into three groups: marijuana smokers, edible users, and non-users. Those in the two cannabis user groups reported taking the drug at least three times per week, either exclusively through smoking or edibles.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To assess the participants’ vascular function, the researchers measured dilation of the brachial artery—located in the upper arm—to determine whether it could properly expand in response to increased blood flow. To that end, they used an inflatable forearm cuff to briefly block blood flow to the artery, then used ultrasound to measure its diameter before and after inflating the cuff. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Matt Springer, a cardiovascular researcher at UCSF whose lab led the study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/marijuana/weed-may-be-bad-for-your-heart-whether-you-smoke-or-consume-edibles"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Live Science that his test offers a “window into the future.” When blood vessels cannot fully dilate, he said, the risk of heart attack and other poor cardiovascular outcomes increases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants who did not consume cannabis showed an average vessel dilation—represented as the percent change from the baseline measurement of artery diameter—of 10.4%. This value was significantly reduced among weed smokers and edible users, who showed an average vessel dilation of 6.0% and 4.6%, respectively. For reference, average values for brachial artery dilation in healthy individuals typically &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4324696/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from 8.0% to 15%. In a previous study, Springer’s lab &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/ATVBAHA.121.317749"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; similarly reduced levels of vessel dilation among e-cigarette and cigarette smokers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To better understand how THC causes this change, the researchers ran lab tests to determine how endothelial cells—which &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26848/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the linings of blood vessels and release nitric oxide to trigger dilation—responded to the participants’ blood samples. These tests revealed that the blood of chronic cannabis smokers inhibited nitric oxide production in the cells, which may explain why these participants showed reduced vessel dilation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This effect was not observed in edible consumers, however, suggesting that ingestible THC may impact arterial function via an entirely separate mechanism. Figuring out what that mechanism may be will require further research. What’s more, subsequent studies will need to reproduce these findings in a larger population to validate the results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within the last several years, cannabis use among U.S. adults has reached new heights, according to the NIH’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/2024/08/cannabis-and-hallucinogen-use-among-adults-remained-at-historic-highs-in-2023"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As such, investigating the health effects of THC is more important than ever before—especially as mounting evidence challenges perceptions of weed as a harmless high. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking archaeological discovery has been made, where more than 850 Paleolithic artifacts, including hand axes dating back up to 1.5 million years, were uncovered. The findings, made with just the naked eye, provide invaluable insight into the ancient tools of early human ancestors, highlighting a significant era of toolmaking during the Paleolithic period. This discovery was made possible by a collaborative project led by Dr. Ella Egberts of&lt;a href="https://press.vub.ac.be/vub-researcher-discovers-hand-axes-that-may-go-back-15-million-years-ago-in-iraqi-desert" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)&lt;/a&gt;, Jaafar Jotheri of the &lt;a href="https://en.qu.edu.iq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Al-Qadisiyah&lt;/a&gt;, and independent researcher Andreas Nymark, alongside local researchers in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Impact of Ancient Water Sources&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings were discovered in an area that once hosted a large Pleistocene lake, offering clues about early human life in the region. The dry desert terrain, now far from any major water sources, was once crisscrossed with fossilized river channels, signaling that it played a vital role in the survival of early human populations. This was not just a desert landscape but a lifeline for humans who might have relied on these ancient waters for sustenance and migration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ella Egberts and her team conducted a pilot project in this area to explore surface materials scattered across the landscape. &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/archaeologists-iraqs-ancient-megastructure/" data-type="post" data-id="82323"&gt;This specific region in Iraq,&lt;/a&gt; marked by ancient water beds, holds exceptional potential for understanding how humans interacted with their environment. The large area of discovery (about 10 by 20 km) helped uncover several Paleolithic sites, where the tools were initially spotted and then studied in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Early Humans and Their Simple Tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the most significant discoveries were the &lt;strong&gt;hand axes&lt;/strong&gt;, which date back to the Early Paleolithic period. These tools, some of which could be as old as 1.5 million years, demonstrate the early stages of human toolmaking. Early humans would have used these tools for essential tasks like hunting, processing food, and surviving harsh conditions. The discovery of these &lt;strong&gt;Old Paleolithic&lt;/strong&gt; materials indicates that early humans had already begun shaping their environment, albeit with relatively rudimentary tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The fieldwork was a huge success,” confirms Dr. Egberts. “Our targeted fieldwork resulted in the discovery of seven Paleolithic sites in an area of 10 by 20 km. One location was selected for a systematic study to determine the spatial distribution of the Paleolithic material and to conduct preliminary technological and typological analyses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These early tools, such as the hand axes, have given archaeologists a deeper understanding of the timeline of human evolution and survival strategies. However, the discovery doesn’t stop there—more advanced tools were also found at the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Hand Axes to Levallois Flakes: A Leap in Human Technology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago, humans advanced their tool-making techniques significantly. During the &lt;strong&gt;Middle Paleolithic&lt;/strong&gt;, they developed a more organized and sophisticated way of shaping stone tools. The &lt;strong&gt;Levallois technique&lt;/strong&gt;, where a stone core is carefully shaped to produce specific flakes, is one such example. This method shows that early humans were not only more precise in their craftsmanship but also able to plan and anticipate their needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery of Levallois flakes in the region offers a fascinating insight into the cognitive and social development of early human groups. As Egberts explains, “Based on the distribution of the sites and the advancing understanding of the region’s geomorphological history, there are emerging clues of early human landscape use. In the future, I hope to expand my research to a larger area, systematically sample all the sites, and conduct in-depth technological and typological artifact analysis.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Training Future Generations: Knowledge Transfer in the Field&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key part of Dr. Egberts’ project was her commitment to fostering the next generation of archaeologists. Throughout the study, she led workshops and field training for local students from &lt;strong&gt;Al-Qadisiyah University&lt;/strong&gt;. These hands-on experiences allowed students to engage directly with ancient artifacts and gain valuable skills in archaeological techniques. It also provided them with the opportunity to analyze the surrounding soils and understand the intricate layers that have preserved these ancient materials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jaafar Jotheri, one of the local researchers involved, stated that this collaborative fieldwork “provided invaluable learning opportunities for students who gained firsthand experience handling Paleolithic items and analyzing the surrounding soils.” This aspect of the project demonstrates the importance of collaboration and knowledge-sharing in preserving archaeological heritage, while also fostering the skills necessary for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary cholesterol has minimal impact on blood cholesterol; focus instead on fat and fiber.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meals rich in fiber and heart-healthy fats can lower LDL and boost HDL cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This Black Bean Fajita Skillet is a heart-healthy, customizable lunch great for managing cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When managing high cholesterol, many think they need to avoid dietary cholesterol at all costs. While those were the previous guidelines, research now shows that there’s a minimal or even a lack of correlation between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;However, you still need to be mindful of what you eat, since foods can affect your blood cholesterol levels. Lucky for you, this lunch is exactly what you need to improve this marker. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are two types of cholesterol—LDL and HDL. LDL, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, is known as the “bad” type. And HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol is known as the “good” type. While reducing your LDL levels is essential, increasing your HDL levels is equally important. In fact, HDL is a crucial lipoprotein that may help lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Guidelines for what makes a meal good for those watching their cholesterol should be low in saturated fats, providing heart-healthy fats and being high in fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-black-bean-fajita-skillet-a-great-low-cholesterol-lunch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes Black Bean Fajita Skillet a Great Low-Cholesterol Lunch? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This delicious recipe is not only an ample opportunity for adding ingredients to tailor it to your own tastes, but it delivers the nutrients you need to improve your cholesterol levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Rich in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber is one of the most effective nutrients for lowering LDL cholesterol, and this recipe delivers 17 grams of dietary fiber per serving. Black beans are the star here, packed with soluble fiber that binds with cholesterol in your digestive system and helps remove it from your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Fiber, especially from beans and veggies, helps lower LDL cholesterol. The beans and peppers in this recipe are good sources of fiber,” says &lt;a href="https://www.clairerifkinnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Claire Rifkin, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another benefit of eating a meal with fiber is that you will stay full for longer. The fiber in food sets off a chain of responses that ultimately decrease ghrelin, the hunger hormone, and increase leptin, a hormone that helps regulate metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding even more veggies to this recipe increases the fiber content even further and introduces different flavors and textures. Additionally, it enhances the micronutrient nutrition profile. You can customize this recipe in so many ways with the flavors you love most.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Packed with Heart-Healthy Fats &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This lunch uses olive oil, an unsaturated fat that’s been shown to help reduce LDL levels. Olive oil isn’t just a swap—it’s an upgrade. Rich in monounsaturated fats, olive oil and other heart-healthy fats may help protect against cardiovascular disease, including heart attack and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One opportunity for adding even more unsaturated fat to this recipe would be to top it with sliced or mashed avocado after the fajita skillet is cooked. “I’d add sliced avocado for healthy fats and plate it on greens for extra fiber. These add-ons would make the meal more heart-healthy and also help you stay fuller for longer,” says Rifkin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low in Saturated Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While everything in moderation is good, research shows that excessive saturated fat can increase your LDL cholesterol, contributing to plaque buildup in your arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Red meat, full-fat dairy and fried foods are common sources of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Saturated fat in this recipe comes from the optional cheddar cheese, and even that is limited to 2 tablespoons per serving. For those especially concerned with cholesterol, you can simply skip the cheese or opt for a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024093/best-low-fat-cheeses/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower-fat alternative&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-cholesterol-healthy-lunch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For In A Cholesterol-Healthy Lunch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing a lunch to help support healthy cholesterol levels, Rifkin recommends focusing on the following:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich in Whole Grains&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, and buckwheat, can help lower cholesterol levels. Whole grains can increase the amount of bile your body produces, which has the effect of lowering cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low in Saturated Fat&lt;/strong&gt;: Try to limit your intake of sources of saturated fats, such as butter, cheese, cream, coconut oil and fatty meats. The American Heart Association recommends keeping your saturated fat intake below 6% of your total daily calories. So for a 2,000-calorie diet, that’s no more than 120 calories or 13 grams of saturated fat per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High in Heart-Healthy Fats&lt;/strong&gt;: Ingredients such as olive oil, avocado, nuts and fatty fish contain heart-healthy fats that can raise HDL (known as “good”) cholesterol and lower LDL (known as “bad”) cholesterol levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packed with Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Foods like beans, lentils, oats and vegetables help lower LDL cholesterol by binding to it in the digestive system. Aim for meals that provide at least 6 grams of fiber per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low in Trans Fat&lt;/strong&gt;: While artificial trans fats have largely been removed from the food supply following an FDA ban, small amounts of trans fat occur naturally in animal products, such as beef, lamb and cheese.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Although our sex is determined at the moment the sperm fertilizes the egg, it is not until a month and a half later that the biological programming to develop testes or ovaries is activated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Textbooks have always taught that this process is 100% dictated by genetics: males have one female and &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-23/the-male-sex-chromosome-the-last-unexplored-territory-of-human-dna-has-been-conquered.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-08-23/the-male-sex-chromosome-the-last-unexplored-territory-of-human-dna-has-been-conquered.html"&gt;one male chromosome&lt;/a&gt;, XY, and females have &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-02-02/scientists-identify-one-reason-women-suffer-more-from-autoimmune-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-02-02/scientists-identify-one-reason-women-suffer-more-from-autoimmune-diseases.html"&gt;two female chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;, XX. But on Wednesday, the results of a bold experiment with mice were published, showing that very low iron levels in the mother can transform males into females, regardless of their genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that an environmental factor can influence sex determination in a mammal,” &lt;a href="https://www.fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research_group/detail/6" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.fbs.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/research_group/detail/6"&gt;Makoto Tachibana&lt;/a&gt;, a biologist at Osaka University in Japan and leader of the research, published in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09063-2" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09063-2"&gt;journal &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells EL PAÍS. “The most important implication of this finding,” he adds, “is that environmental and metabolic conditions influence fundamental developmental decisions that until now were thought to be strictly determined by genetics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Almost four decades ago, the study of people born with ovaries despite being genetically male (XY), and vice versa — a rare genetic disorder — led to the discovery of the &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2022-07-08/gender-identity-is-not-something-that-you-choose-as-evidenced-by-the-failure-of-conversion-therapies.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/society/2022-07-08/gender-identity-is-not-something-that-you-choose-as-evidenced-by-the-failure-of-conversion-therapies.html"&gt;SRY gene&lt;/a&gt;. This genetic fragment within the male Y chromosome is the main factor responsible for sexual differentiation in mammals. If the gene is present, the gonads begin to form testes at six weeks of development; if not, they inevitably become ovaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This process also initiates the production of sex hormones and the activation of other genes that produce more physical traits characteristic of each sex. All this happens in the highly protected environment of the uterus, safe from environmental interference. Mammals are unusual in this respect, since many animals determine their sex based on temperature, social hierarchy, size, or parasites infecting the mother, as occurs in some&lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-11-14/animals-that-change-sex-how-and-why-do-they-do-it.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-11-14/animals-that-change-sex-how-and-why-do-they-do-it.html"&gt; reptiles, fish, and insects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The researchers discovered that if iron concentration is reduced by 60% at the cellular level, the testicular gene is switched off. When they reproduced this iron deficiency in pregnant female mice carrying males, they observed that six out of 39 XY offspring were born with two ovaries, a complete sex reversal. Another mouse was born intersex, with one ovary and one testicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The same happened in another set of experiments, where they studied the morphology of embryos from mothers treated with a drug that sequesters iron from the body: five out of 72 males developed female sexual organs. Although these numbers of sex reversal might seem small, it is an undeniable effect on a fundamental developmental mechanism previously thought to be shielded from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The study details how an external factor ends up influencing the fetus’s genetics. It is through epigenetics, a collection of chemical marks sensitive to environmental factors located on the genome that modify its functioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Extremely low iron affects the enzyme KDM3A, which modifies a chemical change that turns off the testis-producing gene SRY right at the moment of sex determination. The result is genetically male mice with two ovaries that lived apparently healthy up to eight weeks, although it has not been studied whether they could reproduce — in humans, sex reversal usually leads to infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Iron deficiency in the body, which can cause anemia, is a health risk for both the mother and the baby. This deficiency is usually not severe and can be corrected on its own or by eating iron-rich foods such as cockles. However, in more severe cases, it must be treated, as it can increase the risk of miscarriage, perinatal mortality, and susceptibility to infections in the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w _pr lb_btn"&gt;&lt;img alt="Makoto Tachibana" decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/KHLVSI3BXBACPOZ2IY2X5QUN5Q.jpg?auth=a07fc74d5e318f7ced0f1212734241084707cc9d390d33ebf91eb2d70c9a0872&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" class="icon_multimedia_ampliar | _pa a_m_i a_m_i-a _dn" viewbox="0 0 40 40"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Makoto Tachibana, center back row, with the rest of his team from Osaka University in Japan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;M. T.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“At this point, we don’t know if a similar process could occur in humans,” says Tachibana. While he believes it would be difficult to find such low iron levels in nature, he argues “it’s a very important question that deserves to be investigated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ugr.es/personal/francisco-javier-barrionuevo-jimenez" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ugr.es/personal/francisco-javier-barrionuevo-jimenez"&gt;Francisco Javier Barrionuevo&lt;/a&gt;, professor of genetics at the University of Granada in Spain, who did not participate in the study, highlights its importance. “Discovering that something as mundane as iron concentration can cause a mammalian embryo to develop as a female is spectacular,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;His team is investigating several biological components that can interfere in this process, including one they discovered very recently: tiny RNA sequences with no apparent function that are nevertheless capable of causing a complete sex reversal. In this case, the biologist warns, it is even more surprising because it is an external element not linked to the genetic code. Barrionuevo returns to the question raised by his Japanese colleague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Something like this has never been described in humans, as the study itself explains, but I think it could have happened in cases of extreme malnutrition and simply gone undetected,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01456-7" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01456-7"&gt;op-ed published alongside the study&lt;/a&gt;, cellular biologists Shannon Dupont and Blanche Capel, from Duke University in the United States, celebrate the “impressive series of experiments.” This study “provides clear evidence that variations in metabolism in the controlled uterine environment interface with the genetic sex-determination cascade and affect testis development,” state the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Chapel and Dupont note that iron deficiency is a known factor that can affect the health of both the mother and the baby, potentially impacting their neurological development. Following this line of thought, they wonder what other more subtle effects this deficiency might have, which opens up the possibility that the mother’s diet could affect not only the formation of testes but also other traits of “masculinity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:39:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>KRVN 880 – KRVN 93.1 – KAMI –内布拉斯加州西南部Tularemia病例增加-农村无线电网络 | KRVN 880 – KRVN 93.1 – KAMI - Increase in Tularemia cases in southwest Nebraska - Rural Radio Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOUEVLdU9HVDh3OFdmMzNZaEVfS3VVRE4zUXhTZ1VSQVBlWjBmTUJYY0R0U0ItM0NPVE82M3pzUkVJYWYwdDgyMUluMHRvU18xcUoyS3hZc3c0cFIxcHlkb1dEZjBYMkFIMHY5S1FLOUt2VjdZdEZ6VmVKNEY0a3RvbFN2ZUNpX2xpTmR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
				
&lt;p&gt;Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department (SWNPHD) has received reports of three cases of tularemia in the health district over the past month.  Tularemia can be spread by tick bites, deer fly bites or contact with infected animals such as wild rabbits. Tularemia can be prevented by wearing insect repellant and keeping a safe distance from wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a concerning number of cases for this tickborne disease,” explains Melissa Propp RN, Clinic Manager at SWNPHD. “Only 6 cases of tularemia were reported to us during the past 10 years, so getting three cases in a month is unusual. We encourage everyone to take extra precautions to avoid tick bites.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tularemia is caused by bacteria that get into the body when someone is bitten by an infected tick or touches an infected rabbit or rodent. The symptoms are fever, headache, swollen glands in the armpit or groin, and skin ulcers at the site of the bite. Tularemia can be life-threatening, but most infections are treated successfully with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How to prevent tularemia:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use bug spray that prevents tick bites with DEET or other EPA-approved ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use permethrin on tents and camping gear to repel ticks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep a safe distance from wild rabbits and other rodents.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If you need to handle wild animals, use gloves and wash your hands well afterwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are bitten by a tick, follow safe tick removal steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grasp the tick close to the skin with tweezers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pull the tick straight out, do not twist or bend.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Flush it down the toilet or wrap it in tape and throw it away.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Clean the bite with soap and water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avoid squeezing the body of the tick and do not use creams or chemicals to try to make it remove itself, as that could make it push infected fluid into the skin. Contact your healthcare provider right away if you develop symptoms after being bitten by a tick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may get different illnesses depending on the type of tick and where it lives. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) released information in May through the Health Alert Network (HAN) about all the tickborne diseases that are in Nebraska, including tularemia.  The  HAN is used for sharing important and timely information about public health, and can be found at &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__dhhs.ne.gov_han-2520Documents_UPDATE05052025.pdf&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=1esu62z7Uv4v2qQXJJmIyz_upa5BwzG_yY5cXDaVgac&amp;amp;m=uPkr-w89Wx9inhRBWNSPhscnkwBKgXmHxJ9IBP8Fr3SOphv8pKR9zGW775xDqGNE&amp;amp;s=0_uha1lJSApeTHjOfn0rmGjr5f5hu8ICQMDgRBEqoSI&amp;amp;e="&gt;dhhs.ne.gov/HAN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More information on tularemia may be found at cdc.gov/tularemia or contact SWNPHD at 308-345-4223. Southwest Nebraska Public Health Department serves Chase, Dundy, Frontier, Furnas, Hayes, Hitchcock, Keith, Perkins, and Red Willow counties.  Information can also be found on SWNPHD’s Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

No cases have been reported in the state since. The Associated Press has reported, citing state records, that testing efforts have &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-hasnt-seen-human-bird-175352305.html" data-ylk="slk:“fallen off;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;“fallen off&lt;/a&gt;.” During 2024 at least 50 people were tested per month, compared with three people tested in March, one in April and none in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“In recent weeks, the overall number of new animal H5N1 virus infections reported by [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] has declined, reducing the number of people exposed to infected animals, and human cases have declined as well,” a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While there’s the possibility that the H5N1 virus is waning in the U.S. for the time being, experts are worried that the efforts to monitor bird flu infections is the factor that’s actually waning. Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University, is worried because while these latest cases have been &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/top-doctors-warn-bird-flu-180403844.html" data-ylk="slk:relatively mild;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;relatively mild&lt;/a&gt;, the virus has been “quite deadly,” &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22401-bird-flu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:historically speaking;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;historically speaking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Of the known human cases that have been identified, about half of them have died, Nuzzo told Yahoo News, “and that is a truly staggering percentage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yahoo News spoke to Nuzzo and Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director at the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, in an effort to gain some insight as to why those CDC case numbers haven’t budged in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-havent-we-seen-an-increase-in-human-bird-flu-infections-since-february"&gt;Why haven’t we seen an increase in human bird flu infections since February?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The short answer is, we don’t know,” Nuzzo said. But experts like her have offered some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Migratory bird patterns have changed: &lt;/strong&gt;Wild birds are primary spreaders of avian flu. The United States could be experiencing a natural and temporary decline in human cases, which tend to peak in the fall and early winter, possibly because migration patterns have seasonally changed as well, a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-hasnt-seen-human-bird-175352305.html" data-ylk="slk:CDC official;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;CDC official&lt;/a&gt; noted during a May call with U.S. doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As we expect to see bird migration patterns rev back up here in the next few months, I suspect we're going to see increased levels of H5N1 in migratory birds,” Hopkins said. “That's probably going to result in more poultry flocks and more other animals infected. I think that again raises our risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. It’s possible that less of the virus is circulating: &lt;/strong&gt;Humans can become infected with bird flu through exposure to sick wild birds, poultry, backyard flocks or cattle. Avian flu infections are still being detected in birds and cattle but not as frequently as they were several months ago. “Since February 2025, there have been fewer affected dairy herds and commercial poultry flocks in the United States, and we believe, fewer workers are being exposed to sick animals,” a CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Testing at the state and local levels for H5N1 has decreased:&lt;/strong&gt; Nuzzo suggested that perhaps there has been an overall reduction in human testing for H5N1, rather than a decrease in viral spread. “One of the concerns that I have is that states have appeared to be conducting just less general testing for H5N1,” Nuzzo said. “Those things coupled with a general lack of any communication from federal agencies about H5N1 leaves us very concerned that what we might be seeing is just a contraction of surveillance and not necessarily an abatement of the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A CDC spokesperson told Yahoo News that the agency’s “guidance and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/h5-monitoring/index.html__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!E4kaX89TX2EXsGuaieeDHQOm01gjhgmJHZikqAM4Mx_eZlAl7vHaw4hmbgWj_sXdV-oD7Se9VREdxNcv$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:surveillance efforts;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;surveillance efforts&lt;/a&gt; for human cases of H5N1 virus infections have not changed. State and local health departments continue to monitor for illness in persons exposed to sick animals. However, no new human cases of H5N1 virus infections have been identified and reported to CDC in recent months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Less prevalence in wastewater surveillance: &lt;/strong&gt;People who contract bird flu can shed pieces of the virus through wastewater, like from handwashing, bathing or laundering clothes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But as the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC website;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC website&lt;/a&gt; notes, “Wastewater data cannot determine the source of influenza A viruses.” Nuzzo agrees that wastewater surveillance alone isn’t the best method in determining whether human bird flu infections are waning but “probably the best thing we have in terms of figuring out how much virologic activity is occurring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hopkins says the presence of H5N1 showing up in wastewater surveillance has slowed. “So less virus means less transmission,” Hopkins said. “They are positive factors for right now, and they don't mean that we won't have greater problems going forward,” he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For the week ending May 24, out of 340 sites nationwide as part of the CDC’s National Wastewater Surveillance System, there were 17 sites, in New Jersey and Oregon, that reported any detection of H5N1, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/wwd-h5.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.

Based on data from over 5,000 gamers worldwide, the research found that the “dysregulated” and “relational” profiles were associated with greater psychological distress and insecure attachment patterns, while the “avoidant” and “engaged” profiles were linked to emotional stability and healthier relationships with gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers affiliated with ISPA – Instituto Universitário and the APPsyCI Applied Psychology Research Center conducted the study to better understand the complex factors that shape gaming behavior. While video games are a popular form of entertainment for people of all ages, concerns have grown about the potential for excessive or problematic gaming, especially in younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health challenges, substance use, attachment difficulties, and social environments can all contribute to how individuals engage with video games. However, many studies to date have focused on narrow aspects of gaming, such as time spent playing or clinical symptoms, without considering the broader psychological and social context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study was born from a shared interest in understanding the psychological complexity of gaming behaviors, particularly in the context of Gaming Disorder, but we also wanted to know about non-problematic gaming behaviors,” said study authors Cátia Martins Castro (a PhD candidate in psychology) and David Dias Neto (an associate professor of psychology).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the primary motivations was the desire to integrate the most relevant psychological factors — emotional regulation and motivation to play videogames — into profiles, and then comprehend the various dimensions, such as attachment styles, mental health, and gaming characteristics related to these profiles, that could one day support clinicians in their practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From a personal perspective (Cátia), this need was strongly felt in my clinical work, where it was often difficult to translate research into practical tools for assessing and supporting my clients who were gamers with problematic use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also committed to ensuring inclusivity, both in terms of the types of games played and the diversity of the gaming population,” the researchers explained. “These are, to our knowledge, the first psychological profiles of gamers to include non-binary participants, to be generalizable across all game genres, and to be drawn from an international sample spanning 112 countries. This breadth gives the profiles substantial potential for clinical and cultural relevance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, their aim was to explore how mental health indicators, social and relational dynamics, and gaming-specific behaviors cluster together to form meaningful patterns among gamers. They focused particularly on how emotional regulation and motivations for gaming vary across profiles and how these profiles relate to risk factors for problematic gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study drew on responses from 5,255 individuals aged 16 to 69, with a mean age of approximately 25. Participants came from 112 countries and identified as men (about 50%), women (43%), or non-binary (9%). Data were collected through an online questionnaire shared on social media and gaming platforms. Participants answered questions about their gaming habits, emotional experiences, social connections, substance use, and attachment patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the psychological profiles, the researchers used a person-centered statistical approach that groups individuals based on similarities across multiple variables. They measured emotional regulation using a standardized scale assessing impulse control, emotional awareness, and the ability to act in goal-directed ways despite distress. They also assessed gaming motivations, such as playing for escapism, identity, or social connection. In addition, they examined attachment styles—patterns of relating to others developed early in life—as well as self-reported mental health symptoms and substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed four distinct gamer profiles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoidant profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals in this group were generally older and reported low levels of psychological distress. They showed secure attachment patterns and a preference for offline social interactions. Their gaming motivations centered around personal exploration, autonomy, and recreation rather than social connection. This profile was also associated with lower levels of substance use and minimal use of social media for gaming-related communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engaged profile:&lt;/strong&gt; This was the largest group and included gamers with good emotional regulation and secure attachment. Like the avoidant group, they showed low psychological distress and little substance use. However, they were more socially integrated into gaming communities and used platforms such as Discord, Twitch, and Instagram to connect with others. Smartphone gaming was common in this group. While they did not often play online games with others, they maintained strong offline social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relational profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Members of this group showed emotional regulation difficulties and higher levels of attachment avoidance. They were more likely to play games for social connection and identity reinforcement but had fewer offline social interactions. Although they experienced some functional impairments and showed higher risk behaviors such as hallucinogen use, they did not report high levels of overt psychological distress. Their gaming preferences leaned toward immersive, socially driven experiences, and they frequently used platforms like Steam and Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dysregulated profile:&lt;/strong&gt; This group was made up of younger gamers who reported the highest levels of emotional distress and showed difficulties in all areas of emotional regulation. They had both attachment anxiety and avoidance, indicating significant interpersonal difficulties. They were more likely to use tobacco and energy drinks and showed signs of behavioral dysregulation, including risk to self or others. These gamers also spent more time gaming alone or with online friends and frequently used multiple social media platforms to engage with gaming communities. This group had the highest risk of developing gaming disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that these profiles were significantly shaped by age, emotional regulation, mental health symptoms, and patterns of online and offline interaction. The dysregulated profile stood out for its combination of psychological vulnerabilities and intense engagement with online gaming and social platforms, which the researchers suggest may reflect a maladaptive coping strategy. In contrast, the avoidant and engaged profiles appeared to reflect more balanced and recreational use of gaming, with strong offline support networks and lower distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One important takeaway is that non-problematic gaming can be associated with individuals who maintain healthy emotional bonds and social relationships,” Castro and Neto told PsyPost. “In contrast, problematic gaming can emerge when individuals experience relational difficulties, whether through anxious attachment (fearing abandonment) or avoidant patterns (distancing from intimacy).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some, games may become the preferred médium of interaction, especially when face-to-face connections feel threatening or overwhelming. In these cases, the gaming environment may offer a sense of structure, predictability, and a sense of control, but it may also reinforce avoidance and deepen isolation. This highlights the need for supportive and nuanced approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the relational profile shared some risk factors with the dysregulated group, such as emotional difficulties and insecure attachment, it did not show the same level of psychological symptoms or substance use. The researchers interpret this group as selectively engaged with gaming in a way that offers social connection, possibly compensating for offline challenges without necessarily crossing into dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also surprised to find that in the avoidant profile, “players preferred to play alone (e.g., single-player games) yet showed secure attachment. It was also surprising the way that the dysregulated profile was associated with relational difficulties, particularly with both anxious and avoidant insecure attachment styles, as well as with some substance use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several strengths, including its large and diverse sample and the use of well-validated psychological measures. However, the researchers caution that the findings are based on cross-sectional data, which limits their ability to draw conclusions about cause and effect. For example, it is unclear whether emotional dysregulation leads to problematic gaming, or whether excessive gaming worsens emotional difficulties. Longitudinal studies are needed to track how these profiles develop and change over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that the self-report nature of the study could introduce bias, as participants may underreport distress or overestimate their social engagement. Additionally, the study did not analyze specific gaming genres or content, which could influence motivations and psychological impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As with many psychological studies, our data are self-reported and based on a convenience sample, which can introduce bias and limit generalisability,” Castro and Neto noted. “Additionally, the cross-sectional nature of the data constrains causal interpretation. That said, although the size and diversity of the sample are considerable, we see this work as a first step in a broader line of research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their long-term goal is to provide tools for clinicians and policymakers to recognize diverse gaming behaviors and offer tailored interventions. They also hope the findings can contribute to more inclusive strategies for promoting healthy gaming habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently finalizing a longitudinal study that follows these profiles over time, which will allow us to draw stronger inferences and examine how gaming behaviors evolve in relation to psychological variables,” Castro and Neto said. “Our long-term goal is to support clinicians with evidence-based tools that can inform assessment and intervention. This includes developing profile-based guidance for tailored approaches. We also hope that this work can be the beginning of studies that help shape policy and public health strategies, respecting the complexity of gaming behavior with inclusivity (e.g., by including non-binary individuals).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to thank all participants who contributed to this study, and to ISPA and APPSYCI Research Center. Working together has been a deeply enriching process, combining research and clinical thinking. Cátia, PhD candidate, who also works as a clinical psychologist, and David, PhD supervisor and experienced researcher, who also works as a clinical psychologist and psychotherapist. We hope this study adds value to both the scientific community and the people it aims to support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:04:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPQkFPN2MyUXJxZkxXc2tBSXlEYVp2SWRacFJjZS1scVFUYmhuTzhEdTNBWllPYmwtblNUOXZFSHhkSHVObkphdTNRR1RUaDNBVUZTSTBfcGwzdFJkZDlaT3RlTDRwNi1CZnFsbVFjWS15ZzYwZzRROFZlTW05UEI1czl4OGNCX21BRHJiVVlLZ3BFMXV4b1VJRVpaeWRsRzlPUFplMXpuN1U5cG9ULWtMVVFqcE5JbFVIUjl1S2dKRnFzRmtu</guid></item><item><title>我尽一切努力来修复我的尿失禁。以下是行之有效的方法-《卫报》 | I tried everything to fix my incontinence.

Luckily, I was able to retrieve it before it entered the drain pipe, preventing the need for a mortifying 3am call to my super. This was both my first and last time using the Kegel ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Eighteen years prior, I had experienced bladder leakage after giving birth, but it resolved within a year. Once perimenopause hit at age 47, however, the condition returned and managing it had become my part-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;At the advice of my gynecologist, I’d tried daily self-directed Kegel exercises, tampon-like devices designed to prevent leaks by lifting the urethra and bladder training – or gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits, which I lost interest in pretty quickly. None of these options really worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So my bladder kept leaking, usually after laughing, coughing or sneezing. Panty liners were now an essential part of my wardrobe. The worst leaks occurred when I went on a run, and required more substantial protection. I wondered how many other middle-aged women on my Central Park loop had diaper-like devices hidden under their Lululemon leggings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="02fee265-62a4-48ac-ab78-b0d5703d6ea2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Perimenopause has brought chaos to my life – but also peace","elementId":"02fee265-62a4-48ac-ab78-b0d5703d6ea2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/mar/27/perimenopause-life-changes"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Probably a lot. More than 60% of US women surveyed from 2015 to 2018 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35030139/#full-view-affiliation-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported bladder control challenges&lt;/a&gt;. Incontinence often begins after childbirth, due to a combination of estrogen loss and physical trauma, says Dr Meghan Markowski, board certified clinical specialist in women’s health physical therapy at Brigham and Women’s hospital. “Because we have a certain reserve of estrogen, things get better. Then, when we start to lose estrogen in peri- and post-menopause, these symptoms come back with full-fledged vengeance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I was an empty nester, recent divorcee and dating again for the first time in decades when incontinence rereared its ugly head. On dates, I’d often scurry away in order to beat the leak. I wondered what these men thought of all those visits to the bathroom – perhaps they suspected I was sneaking drugs or plotting my escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although males are also likely to lose some bladder control with age, middle-aged men &lt;a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/10.1016/j.juro.2010.05.025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;do not experience&lt;/a&gt; the same surge in incontinence that women do. The men I met were mostly my age and their kids had probably been potty trained a decade ago, or more. Did they really want a partner who was going through the reverse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you can’t beat it, talk about it, I decided. And as I started to share, I noticed two things. First, men are usually OK with discussing your vaginal region, no matter the reason. And second, when I revealed my problem to female friends, I learned that I was in good company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s no reason why this should be taboo,” said &lt;a href="https://doctors.nyp.org/larissa-rodriguez-md/525-east-68th-street" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Dr Larissa Rodríguez&lt;/a&gt;, urologist-in-chief and director of the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/weillcornell.org/center-for-female-pelvic-health__;!!Aut6IJkzM0Y!pi8yYMfSggU_yQ29kriQoMu96GG0JbZ1OQgqOAzttFQmdGSj8n3VNaIzvEKEmPyrGDXPX0I3aROFiqoGygRlmdoVgrY$" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Center for Female Pelvic Health&lt;/a&gt; at NewYork-Presbyterian hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine. “For anything that affects women’s quality of life, they should seek care because there are ways to treat it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-causes-incontinence-in-women" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes incontinence in women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There are two main types of incontinence: stress and urge. Both occur because of a decline in estrogen, which weakens the pelvic floor and thins the lining of the urethra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress incontinence is caused by physical pressure – such as coughing or running – putting stress on the bladder, leading to urine leakage. This is common when the pelvic muscles, which support the urethra, are weak. This is the type I had: unpleasant and inconvenient, but manageable with pads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Urge incontinence occurs when the bladder contracts more than it should, and can be much harder to live with. “It’s characterized by the sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is either difficult or impossible to defer,” said Markowski. “You could be out shopping, everything’s great, and you go to check out and all of a sudden … &lt;em&gt;Clear the path! I have to get there immediately!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-treat-incontinence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to treat incontinence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For stress incontinence, the gold standard is sling surgery,” said Rodríguez. The sling is “material put under the urethra, like a hammock, so the urethra has something to close against when there’s an increase in abdominal pressure”. Traditionally, mesh is used but it’s also possible for doctors to harvest tissue from the patient, like the lining of the abdomen or the fascia of the thigh muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alternatively, stress incontinence can be relieved by injecting bulking agents to increase resistance and thickness in the urethral wall. “These are similar to the fillers people use for wrinkles,” said Rodríguez. “They are mostly water-based and close the urethra up a bit.” This is a good option for those who want to avoid surgery. It’s a shorter-term fix, but can last several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Urge incontinence can be improved with two types of medication, both of which reduce bladder contractions. The first type, anticholinergics, accomplish this by blocking the chemical messenger acetylcholine, while the second type, beta-3 agonists, relax the bladder’s detrusor muscle, thereby increasing bladder capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If medication fails, Rodríguez said nerve modulation – changing nerve activity via stimulation – is the next step. Inserting a pacemaker near the sacral nerves, which manage the bladder, can result in improved brain-to-bladder communication and control. Acupuncture can stimulate nerves at the ankle, blocking abnormal signals from the bladder and preventing spasms. Another option is injecting botulinum toxin, the same one people &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/apr/14/qa-why-are-more-people-using-botox-and-what-are-the-risks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;use for cosmetic purposes&lt;/a&gt;. It relaxes the bladder muscles so you don’t have spasms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Stress and urge incontinence are both caused by midlife estrogen decline, so ongoing vaginal estrogen supplementation may help, like what’s prescribed for vaginal dryness at menopause, according to Dr Rajita Patil, assistant clinical professor of OB-GYN at UCLA and director of UCLA Health’s comprehensive menopause care program. “It takes a few months to see a difference, and the risks are really low,” said Patil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-22" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are the muscles so weak you can’t activate them? Or are they so tense you can’t activate them? The starting function of the pelvic floor muscles will determine the plan of care,” Markowski said. But a training program takes time; Markowski recommends at least three months. If this seems daunting, she suggests at least one pelvic physical therapy session to be properly evaluated and advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No matter which treatment you choose, behavior modification is also essential. “Alcohol, caffeine, carbonated beverages and artificial sweeteners irritate the bladder,” said Patil, who also encourages adequate hydration and maintaining a “healthy” body weight. “The more fat there is on the bladder and the urethral sphincter, the greater the pressure exerted on these structures, weakening their ability to maintain closure and increasing the likelihood of urinary leakage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another behavioral strategy is bladder retraining – gradually increasing the time intervals between bathroom visits, improving your ability to hold urine – which my gynecologist had recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-sling-surgery-fixed-my-incontinence" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How sling surgery fixed my incontinence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A friend mentioned someone who had undergone a sling surgery, which I’d never heard of. It seemed like a great option, and I could hardly contain my excitement. A week after turning 50, I made an appointment with a urogynecologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="77a5daef-d2db-474c-8ce8-14a582ca7eac" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":29,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Prolapse, tearing, pain: a urogynecologist on what you should know before giving birth","elementId":"77a5daef-d2db-474c-8ce8-14a582ca7eac","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/10/urogynecologist-childbirth-interview"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I’m tired of peeing in my pants,” were my exact words. “Please fix me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A bladder test determined that I had stress incontinence. I scheduled the surgery, an outpatient procedure covered by insurance. Recovery was virtually painless; I didn’t even take any Tylenol. I stayed home for a few days, and was told not to exercise or “stick anything in the vagina” for four weeks. The hardest part was not being able to work out, but the anticipation of pad-less runs made it worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, two months post-surgery, my runs are pee-free. Last week, I visited my surgeon to reperform the bladder test. She made my bladder uncomfortably full via a catheter, then asked me to make a small cough. Then a medium cough. Then a loud one. My underpants remained as dry as a bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to my surgeon, I should be “fixed” for at least the next 10 years. And physical therapy, though not mandatory, could make the results last longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, there is no such thing as a perfect solution, and treatments may work best when combined with others. Markowski, who’s dedicated over 20 years to helping patients non-surgically, acknowledges that physical therapy might not be enough to resolve symptoms in all cases: “We always want to start with the most conservative measures and up the ante as time goes on, with meds or surgery. But surgery doesn’t change the muscle function, so in many cases, even the surgeon will want their patient to undergo physical therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Rodríguez, a surgeon, concurs: “I am a strong believer in physical therapy, and pilates is also quite good in getting people to engage the pelvic floor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The best thing I ever did about my incontinence was start talking about it. Chances are, if you share, you’ll learn that you’re not alone. If you’re really lucky, you’ll even find someone to laugh with you about it. And if you pee a little when you do, you won’t be the only one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQcUx6UlZ2cXRPeEFVYzV5WmVNRVo4UEdPRHZXX0NhOUp6ZjMyZ3hUR1VzTm1tY29JR19xdl9zMDZqSDRGZkVsZ1VzdHFFVlV4NkZTSlItSVRHZjRacVVhbXNsRjNOanp0QUxBeXNUbnZhNDc5M2pYYXpwLTB1QmdodE9pc2ttNE1EYi10b1h0eFhiNi1jZHQ2X0Y2UzM</guid></item><item><title>麻疹病例： Mahopac餐厅的游客可能已暴露，官员警告- dailyvoice.com | Measles Case: Visitors To Mahopac Restaurant May Have Been Exposed, Officials Warn - dailyvoice.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNOVhLbkhqUWxsVUpGcTY1azg3aTBSeVJ4eXBzeG41TVZMdlZ5Umw3N25YOGRpT0tzVDlmVm9YMDNTOHdJeG9uY09HWHNSNDMyTF82YVBuaHhVd2pEMDBqNS0xU2xGWHBrdzZuY0xkTm9LT0QzMmlUU052YWZqUnFJb0dWVmlPVFk5bzIyLUZwcnlHUjFLWnNqaW9ha3BKanBUMVlwWHBDYmw2alNRd29KQ0FZNHFoZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="e-article-text" data-testid="article-detail-body" js-article-text data-read-smore-words="300"&gt;

        

        
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual, who contracted the illness while traveling abroad, is no longer contagious, according to a Wednesday, June 4 announcement from the Putnam County Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="e-instream-video-container" js-instream-video-container=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, officials are urging anyone who visited Arturo’s Tavern at 878 Route 6 in Mahopac on Wednesday, May 28 between 6 and 10 p.m. to contact the health department immediately, as the infected person visited the establishment while still considered contagious. The number to call is 845-808-1390.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="b-banner m-mobile-rectangle" data-position="mobile_rectangle" data-testid="mobile_rectangle" js-banner=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A communicable disease nurse will help determine any potential exposure and recommend what steps, if any, to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious airborne illness that can spread through coughing and sneezing and, in rare cases, can be fatal. Health officials say the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours even after the infected person has left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="e-nativo-container" js-nativo=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health department praised Arturo’s Tavern for fully cooperating with the investigation and helping identify any potential exposures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="b-banner m-mobile-rectangle" data-position="mobile_rectangle" data-testid="mobile_rectangle" js-banner=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes, sore throat, and later, a rash that spreads from the head down. Anyone who has been exposed and develops symptoms is urged to call their doctor or hospital before arriving so precautions can be taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said those born before 1957, those who have already had measles, or anyone who has received two doses of the MMR vaccine are generally protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Leprosy is one of the oldest human diseases and originated in Eurasia or Africa.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A new study has found a different species of leprosy-causing bacteria existed in the Americas before European settlement. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists once believed Europeans brought leprosy to the American continents via infection from the bacterial species &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now a new study &lt;a rel="noopener follow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adu7144" title="External link — published in the journal Science"&gt;published in the journal Science&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reveals that a different form of leprosy-causing bacteria — called&lt;em&gt; Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; — was already circulating in the Americas for at least one thousand years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leprosy was therefore already affecting American indigenous peoples well before European colonization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="63829704" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/63829704_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A microscope image of rod-shaped bacteria"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;For years, it was believed Mycobacterium leprae bacteria were the only cause of leprosy. That changed with the discovery of a new leprosy-causing Mycobacterium in 2008.&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: public domain&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; in America&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study authors analyzed more than 800 samples taken from ancient remains in &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/canada/t-39628562"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/argentina/t-19131805"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The genomes of the bacteria taken from the samples were reconstructed, analyzed, and dated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparisons between the samples showed the bacterial genomes were of distinctive branches of the &lt;em&gt;lepromatosis &lt;/em&gt;species at each end of the continent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they remained genetically similar. This suggested that the bacteria species had spread rapidly across the Americas, probably covering the landmass in just a few hundred years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leprosy is caused by two bacteria species, not one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leprosy is an ancient disease &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leprosy has been infecting humans for thousands of years. The disease presents as multiple numbing skin lesions. If left untreated, it can result in nerve damage, muscle weakness, paralysis and blindness. Today, leprosy can be treated with &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/antibiotics/t-64386318"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, but ancient sufferers weren't so fortunate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skeletal records from 2,000BCE have been found in India with traces of the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/infectious-diseases/t-71255642"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are matched by written records of leprosy cases in ancient literature from Indian, Chinese and African civilizations, as well as stories in the Abrahamic religions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, these ancient descriptions associated the affliction with stigmas of immorality or ritual uncleanliness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in 1874 the Norwegian doctor Gerhard Armauer Hansen discovered that leprosy was caused by the microscopic organism &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium leprae&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2008, doctors in Mexico found another leprosy-causing bacteria species — &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium lepromatosis &lt;/em&gt;— in a leprosy patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before this, it was believed &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;was the only pathogen capable of causing the disease. Now both forms of the bacteria are known to cause it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="64488260" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/64488260_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A patient whose hand has been affected by leprosy."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Leprosy has been stigmatized around the world for thousands of years, but with quick medical treatment, its dangerous symptoms can be reduced&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Nyein Chan Naing/dpa/picture alliance &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Europeans spread diseases, leprosy too  &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nicolas Rascovan, head of the Microbial Paleogenomics Unit at the Pasteur Institut in France led the investigation. He and his colleagues estimate &lt;em&gt;lepromatosis &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;diverged from a common ancestor about one million years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The diversification happened probably independent of humans," Rascovan told DW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrival of the &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/syphilis-did-christopher-columbus-bring-the-std-to-europe/a-71096335"&gt;first European fleets to the Americas&lt;/a&gt; in 1492 marked the introduction of new diseases to the Americas. Leprosy — in the form of the &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;bacterium — was among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Archaeological evidence has shown &lt;em&gt;leprae &lt;/em&gt;migrated with human groups out of Africa and into Asia and Europe around 40,000 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its introduction to the Americas, along with other diseases, by Europeans devastated &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/dna-study-fills-gaps-in-indigenous-americans-ancestry/a-72558361"&gt;indigenous communities&lt;/a&gt; and intensified the impact of pathogens that were already circulating before colonization. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discovery of &lt;em&gt;lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt;' longer history on the continent further highlights the diversity of pathogens and their complex relationship with humans throughout history, said Rascovan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Europeans had a very important impact by bringing this new species [&lt;em&gt;leprae&lt;/em&gt;] that was absent in America," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leprosy track and trace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rascovan hopes the presence of lepromatosis in the archeological record will improve understanding of pre-colonial disease, especially in the absence of written records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the study helps understand modern cases of leprosy, especially how it could make the jump from animals like squirrels to humans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our work is giving the kick start to really start analyzing, monitoring and understanding the diversity of natural reservoirs [disease carriers]," said Rascovan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said monitoring the disease and preventing spillovers from animals to humans should be a priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disease is still prevalent today — 200,000 cases are reported each year globally. Brazil, India and Indonesia still report more than 10,000 new cases annually, according to WHO data.&lt;/p&gt;

Even with body weight or lighter weights, make sure those last one to two reps are challenging you—that’s how you know you’re getting the most out of a workout. “If you’re making a face on those last two, it is challenging [enough],” says Tang. Do what works for you, and increase as you are able to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="mix-things-up" data-node-id="15" class="css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Mix things up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Tang says that an ideal week includes two days of lifting, five days of 30-minute brisk cardio (which could be &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a63934577/does-walking-build-muscle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/fitness/fitness-tips/a63934577/does-walking-build-muscle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="walking" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;), and one to two days of mobility/stretching. In addition to her weekly workouts with Tang, Malini Wadhera, 57, likes long walks on her recovery days, and sometimes mixes in group fitness classes (like Barry’s or SoulCycle) which Tang encourages for variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training for several years has Wadhera feeling stronger (she can lift heavier weights) and more flexible. Other wins were unexpected: Recently, she surprised herself by getting up from a low stool without using her hands to assist, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="train-power-too" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Train power, too. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;We lose power—the ability to move quickly—as we age, too, says Tang. Exercises like light jumps, bounds, or med ball tosses &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473039/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8473039/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="help maintain type II muscle fibers" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="19.1.0"&gt;help maintain type II muscle fibers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—the ones that help us react quickly and powerfully, and potentially avoid a fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You’ll definitely want to clear these moves with your doctor before you begin, especially if you have osteoporosis or osteopenia, but once you’ve done that, Tang suggests adding one or two power moves to your workouts after your warm up and before your main strength exercises. Check out some sample moves from Tang &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4gZdR9xFn1" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4gZdR9xFn1" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="here" data-node-id="20.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="recover-as-hard-as-you-work" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;Recover as hard as you work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Always prioritize safety and allow for recovery between sessions,” says Dr. Kling. Walking is Tang’s go-to active recovery, and her clients love it, too. It’s a great way to keep blood flowing on those days off from the gym and helps to reduce soreness. Rest and eating right are crucial too: “Sleep and protein are non-negotiables for recovery and results,” says Tang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="fuel-properly" data-node-id="23" class="css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;Fuel properly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Speaking of proper nutrition, it’s essential not only to support recovery, but also to fuel your workouts in general. It’s especially crucial to consume enough protein as we age, says Tang, and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64591955/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a64591955/how-much-protein-do-i-need-to-build-muscle/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="other experts agree" data-node-id="24.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;other experts agree&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="24.3" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Recommended Dietary Allowance" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Recommended Dietary Allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) is about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, active people may want to aim for 1.2 to 2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight. (Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian for personalized advice.)&lt;br data-node-id="24.5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's also recommended to aim for a serving of veggies—the more colorful and varied the better—and a fist-sized portion of whole grains or minimally processed carbs per meal, especially around your workouts. Getting enough water is important, too, as staying hydrated supports joint health and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In terms of supplements, Dr. Kling says &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g64783011/best-creatine-supplements-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/g64783011/best-creatine-supplements-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="creatine" data-node-id="26.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt; may be considered as an adjunct to resistance training for improving muscle strength in women over 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="recruit-help-if-you-need-or-want-it" data-node-id="27" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="27.0"&gt;Recruit help if you need (or want) it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Consider hiring a trainer, even short-term, to learn proper form and get into a groove with strength training. Joining a group class can also help with structure, consistency, and community to help you stay accountable. Milne says she feels a rush of happiness after Tang’s group strength training  classes, something she hadn’t experienced related to exercise in a while. &lt;em data-node-id="28.1"&gt;That’s&lt;/em&gt; what it’s all about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="29.0"&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet.
