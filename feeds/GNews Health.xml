			&lt;p&gt;We don't yet have a cure for dementia, but we do have a growing list of factors that may influence risk – including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-at-one-stage-of-life-may-cut-dementia-risk-by-up-to-45"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/major-study-links-4-healthy-diets-with-up-to-28-lower-dementia-risk"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-may-be-no-safe-amount-of-booze-when-it-comes-to-dementia-risk"&gt;drinking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/6-things-gen-z-should-be-doing-right-now-to-stave-off-dementia-later"&gt;social circles&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/listening-to-music-has-a-surprising-impact-on-dementia-risk-study-shows"&gt;how you listen to music&lt;/a&gt; – and we can now add eating cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study commissioned by Japanese food company Meiji Co., researchers in Japan crunched the numbers on 7,914 people aged 65 or over. Half reported &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cheese-may-actually-fuel-nightmares-surprising-study-confirms"&gt;eating cheese&lt;/a&gt; at least once a week, while half said they didn't eat it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The health of these participants was tracked for three years. Of the cheese-eating group, 134 people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/has-dementia-risk-declined-over-generations-heres-the-science"&gt;developed dementia&lt;/a&gt; (3.4 percent); among cheese abstainers, 176 developed dementia (4.5 percent). That's a difference of around 10 or 11 extra cases in every 1,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/117-year-old-womans-diet-could-help-us-all-live-longer"&gt;117-Year-Old Woman's Diet Could Help Us All Live Longer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that's not a huge variation, and shows an association rather than cause and effect, it adds to what we &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-diet-helps-lower-dementia-risk-and-we-may-finally-know-why"&gt;already know&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-junk-foods-are-worst-for-brain-health"&gt;diet and dementia&lt;/a&gt; – and how eating habits relate to physical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-food-choices-can-fuel-anxiety-and-depression-heres-how"&gt;and mental health&lt;/a&gt; in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings are consistent with prior observational evidence linking dairy intake to cognitive health," Seungwon Jeong, a geriatrics researcher at Niimi University in Japan, and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17213363"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the effect for each person is modest, at a population scale, especially in countries [like Japan] with low cheese intake, such differences could contribute meaningfully to dementia prevention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182557" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DementiaChart.jpg" alt="Dementia chart" class="wp-image-182557 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DementiaChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/DementiaChart-600x494.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182557" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Dementia diagnoses were more common among people who rarely or never ate cheese, but only slightly. (Jeong et al., &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers accounted for several factors that can influence dementia risk, including age, sex, education level, and income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a secondary analysis, they also controlled for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sticking-to-the-mind-diet-could-reduce-your-risk-of-developing-dementia"&gt;healthy eating&lt;/a&gt;: Cheese abstainers tended to have less healthy diets, which might contribute to the link. The association was less strong in this analysis, but was still significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, there seems to be something about cheese in particular that can prevent dementia from developing, aside from the beneficial effects we know that a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-30-year-study-may-have-found-the-single-best-diet-for-healthy-aging"&gt;nutritious diet&lt;/a&gt; can have. This isn't something the researchers looked at specifically, but past studies offer some clues as to what might be going on here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese contains nutrients known to help brain health, for example, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3945/an.111.001784"&gt;including vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;. It's also rich in beneficial bacteria for the gut, and plenty of earlier research has found a connection between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-one-more-link-between-our-gut-and-our-brain-that-could-help-avoid-dementia"&gt;gut health and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also strong evidence that fermented dairy foods like cheese are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmaa030"&gt;good for the heart&lt;/a&gt;, and heart health is something that has long been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-health-in-middle-age-could-predict-your-later-dementia-risk"&gt;thought to be important&lt;/a&gt; in dementia risk. As usual with dementia, there are likely many different contributors acting together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the present study did not include biomarker or mechanistic assessments, several nutritional characteristics of cheese may provide a plausible explanation for the observed association," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17213363"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia has been declared a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/global-action-plan-on-the-public-health-response-to-dementia-2017---2025"&gt;key public health priority&lt;/a&gt; by the United Nations, and it's thought that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;at least 50 million people&lt;/a&gt; are currently living with the condition worldwide. That's likely to increase as the population ages, which is a particular concern in Japan, where the research was carried out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/strange-rocks-clinging-to-mummies-could-be-worlds-oldest-cheese"&gt;Strange Rocks Clinging to Mummies Could Be World's Oldest Cheese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistics certainly aren't strong enough to suggest a regular cheesy snack is guaranteed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-itself-could-be-a-crucial-element-in-preventing-dementia-study-finds"&gt;ward off dementia&lt;/a&gt;, but the indications are that it could help. The researchers are keen to expand their work to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further research is warranted to clarify dose-response relationships, cheese subtypes, and underlying mechanisms," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17213363"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17213363"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It could be from well-intentioned friends, a story on the Internet, celebrity statements on social media, or the latest media story. But Joel Bikman and his scientist brother, the co-founders of an innovative new health and weight loss company, are using the latest science to help set the record straight to help people get much healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #1 — My metabolism is slowing down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that as they age, their metabolism (the rate at which they utilize calories for energy) decreases. Not so, says Bikman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to popular belief, we've discovered that our metabolic rate doesn't change as we age," Bikman says. "Instead, metabolism is almost always coupled to our body weight. Interestingly, when someone starts to gain weight, their metabolic rate will actually go up. And if they lose weight, their metabolic rate will go down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman says that instead of metabolism slowing down, far more people break their metabolism by following poor advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a popular weight loss reality show where people starve themselves and exercise like crazy to lose an incredible amount of weight in a relatively short period of time," Bikman says. "That can certainly work in the short-term, but there's a reason you never see reunion shows on these weight loss programs — they don't work long-term. As they inevitably get back in the real world, they start gaining weight again and their metabolism doesn't match it; it doesn't come back up with this incredible yo-yo in body weight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've effectively broken their metabolic rate," Bikman says. "That's when you have real problems. Fortunately, by carefully managing macros [protein, fats and carbohydrates], you can get things back to normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Sorapop Udomsri/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #2 — Exercise can make up for a bad diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be tempted to buy-in to the idea that a good workout can compensate for a bad diet. That's simply not the case for almost anyone, according to Bikman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone should get some amount of exercise 5-6 times a week," he says. "Though it's less for weight loss than it is for a host of other health benefits including cardio and brain health, your ability to maintain balance as you age, and especially for hormones and proper nutrient absorption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bikman, the best kind of exercise is the kind you'll actually do on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But that doesn't mean you can outrun, or out-exercise a bad diet — that's a particularly dangerous myth," Bikman says. "Even the heaviest workouts will only burn a few hundred calories, while eating the wrong kinds of food are not only resistant to being 'burned', they actively encourage your body to store body fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman adds that if you want to "burn" more calories, you can actually do it more effectively through a proper diet. "Your diet likely got you into the shape you're in, but it also can help get you into much better shape now and in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #3 — All calories are the same&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression, "A calorie is a calorie," is one saying that's particularly concerning, Bikman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a chemistry setting that may be correct, but it is absolutely misunderstood in the context of human nutrition and certainly in the context of what we do with energy in the body," Bikman says. "Yet people and experts repeat the same 'calories in, calories out' myth. By that same logic, you could argue that 2,000 calories of soda pop are treated the same within the body as 2,000 calories of properly balanced macronutrients. One essentially kills the body and makes you fat and sick, while the other sustains life and helps you thrive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And that saying completely ignores the impact on your body's systems and hormones," Bikman says. "Experts have clearly shown that hormones, like insulin, have a profound effect on what our body does by way of burning calories, storing calories or even efficiently wasting calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By limiting carbs, and consuming the right blend of proteins and healthy fats, you'll not only have much more sustainable energy," he says. "It will help accelerate your metabolism, help strengthen your immune system, and even aid in gut health and brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Jacek Chabraszewski/Shutterstock.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth #4 — A low-fat diet is the best for weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've ever tried to lose weight, there is a good chance that you've at least considered a low-fat diet. In 1977, the US Dietary Guidelines were published and even without significant evidence from randomized controlled trials and testing, these guidelines recommended a significant reduction in dietary fat, and thus began the nationwide mentality to fear fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People have been told to not eat fats that are clinically shown to be healthy in favor of refined carbohydrates, and the results have been devastating," Bikman says. "Since 1977, the average adult American is nearly 30 pounds heavier; as reported by the Centers for Disease Control, a government agency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman shares that there's overwhelming evidence of the benefits of a high-fat diet for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fats not only help you feel full, they help with brain health, gut health and metabolic health," Bikman says. "This doesn't mean that you can't enjoy carbs, but you need to realize that there are no essential carbs; just essential amino acids (from protein), and essential fatty acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Focus on a wide spectrum of healthy fats from animal sources (like eggs, beef, salmon) and fruit sources (olive, coconut and avocado)," Bikman says. "Refined seed and vegetable oils should be avoided at all costs; they're particularly harmful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bringing solutions from the lab to the real world&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of the information that Bikman and others share, people around the world constantly ask what they should do for their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, we all would have the knowledge, time, discipline and budget to plan, purchase and prepare perfect meals," Bikman says. "But it simply doesn't happen; people get busy, they get stressed and they make unhealthy choices that derail their health goals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It became apparent to Bikman that he needed to be part of the solution to help people achieve their best health more quickly, and especially to assist those that don't always have the time, knowledge or discipline to eat healthy. In response, Bikman and the co-founding team of metabolic and industry experts recently created &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman says these carefully formulated meal shakes are designed to promote healthy weight management, gut health, brain health, even hair, skin and nail health. HLTH Code Complete Meal features an optimized, science-backed blend of protein, collagen, healthy fats, apple cider vinegar, probiotics, fiber, vitamins and minerals—with no added sugar or any artificial ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very fortunate to have a leading metabolic scientist as our formulator," he says. "An incredible amount of work went into making this nutritionally balanced and optimized, yet we knew that if it didn't taste good, no one would use them consistently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solving hunger pangs the right way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to eating, Bikman says it's easy to consume plenty of calories and still feel hungry. This is because the calories consumed are not the right types of calories to provide essential nutrition. He refers to this as "mis-nourishment" and he says it's ruining many people's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each HLTH Code Complete Meal shake is packed with optimized amounts of these ingredients to leave you feeling full and energized for hours," Bikman says. "Yet it's more convenient and affordable than virtually any meal you could make or buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman says the shakes are quick and easy to make: Just add two scoops of Creamy Vanilla or Chocolate Macadamia Complete Meal Powder to 8 oz. of cold water and shake or blend. For general wellness, he recommends replacing one meal daily. To reset your health or for weight loss, replace up to two meals per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are by FAR the BEST meal replacement shakes I've EVER had. and I've tried many. These win by a long shot. They taste like heaven PLUS they're keto-friendly, and I'm keto so win, win, win. 100% HIGHLY recommend them. Couldn't love them more," said &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;one reviewer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reviewer shares, "They are tasty. In addition, they fill me up and keep me full for the entire afternoon. I have managed to pass a weight loss plateau by using these as my lunch every day at work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another review said, "I've been drinking this for 5 months to break my intermittent fast and I'm in my best shape and down 21 pounds. I can't recommend this enough!! Plus it has a great flavor!! What's not to love??"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Does HLTH Code make weight loss easier?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Bikman, the best health starts with the right blend of nutrition. Increased energy, feeling more vibrant, a stronger immune system, a clearer mind, improved gut health, and an improved appearance are some of the benefits from improving one's nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The comprehensive benefits of HLTH Code Complete Meal are especially helpful if you're trying to lose weight," Bikman says. "Weight loss is rarely easy. There has to be the right changes in both hormones and caloric balance to signal to the body that it's time to start burning, not storing, body fat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman adds that based on the best available studies on human metabolism, along with exercise, &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt; helps people lose weight without the need for counting every calorie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your satisfaction is guaranteed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're nervous about trying something new and making changes to your nutrition plan, don't be. Bikman stands by his HLTH Code Meal Replacement products and is willing to guarantee your satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have nothing to lose (except those extra pounds) and everything to gain—in terms of wellness and confidence," Bikman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if you've been looking for improved wellness and healthy weight management, then &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorialhttps://gethlth.com/shop/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Meal Replacement&lt;/a&gt; could well be your answer.

For the surgeon, the meaning of longevity is different.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Longevity is not about immortality; it is about impact. It is never about adding years to life, but instead, it’s all about adding life to years," he said. He identified a very big distinction that many people may confuse. Longevity is about the quality of life, not quantity. It is not about how long you live, but how well you live your life. You could live to be an octogenarian and beyond, and yet struggle with multiple chronic illnesses with severe mobility issues. This reduces the quality of your life. True longevity includes independence, vitality, and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiimstrained-gastroenterologist-reveals-5-food-combinations-for-good-health-eat-chia-seed-with-101763651754740.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="good health"&gt;good health&lt;/a&gt; in the golden years of your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what's true longevity? &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;It is not exactly measured by the number of birthdays you celebrate, but whether you can keep your resilience and good health intact as you age.&lt;/span&gt; You could be in your 60s, strength training, eating healthy, travelling around, beginning new hobbies, and enjoying life without any exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Farman revealed that longevity depends on multiple factors. He said, “Longevity depends on genetic, environmental, and, most of all, daily life habits.” &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;In his practice and across the broader wellness industry, he has observed how even the smallest and consistent choices can have a huge impact on the body over time.&lt;/span&gt; This is why you need to pay attention to your lifestyle habits as they impact your long-term health substantially.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the 5 habits Dr Farman shared that help you live longer and healthier:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Focus on quality sleep:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/20/550x309/sleeping_without_a_pillow_1763638378956_1763638386349.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Make sure you sleep well everyday!(Adobe Stock)" title="Make sure you sleep well everyday!(Adobe Stock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Make sure you sleep well everyday!(Adobe Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There's a reason why experts across the health and wellness industry keep recommending prioritising quality sleep, and for all the right reasons. Dr Farman also advised sleeping well for better ageing. From immediate benefits like waking up well-rested with sharper focus in the morning, to several long-term advantages, sleep unconditionally supports your well-being.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Farman, highlighting sleep as be body's natural repair system, explained, "Aim for 7-8 hours of rest, uninterruptedly. Poor sleep creates inflammation, weakens the immune system, and accelerates ageing.” You can protect your health across decades if you follow healthy sleeping habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Eat mindfully and in moderation:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet is one of the pillars of good health. You have probably heard of the saying, ‘You are what you eat.’ Yes, it is quite literal. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;What you put on your plate determines how you are going to age or if you suffer, but also whether you are likely to develop co-morbidities.&lt;/span&gt; While genes are one of the factors, diet too is instrumental.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Farman advised an appropriate diet, “A diet of vegetables (such as spinach and broccoli), fruits (such as berries and apples), whole grains (like oats and brown rice), and lean proteins (such as fish, eggs, or lentils) is one that is balanced, with limited intake of sugar, salt, and processed foods.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Simultaneously, pay attention to how you eat, as the longevity expert insisted on eating slowly and stopping if you are feeling full so that your metabolism remains healthy.&lt;/span&gt; When you eat fast, you don't allow your body to register the fullness, till the time it extremely strains your digestive system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Stay physically active:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/08/24/550x309/athletes12_1756044811029_1756044811187.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Regular movements keep your mobility levels high. (Shutterstock)" title="Regular movements keep your mobility levels high. (Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Regular movements keep your mobility levels high. (Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The longevity expert warned against a sedentary lifestyle, highlighting that when you move, your joints, heart, and mind stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;A combination of walking, stretching, and light strength training for at least 30 minutes daily can help improve one's circulation, mood, and overall longevity,” he recommended, emphasising that physical activity needs to be a part of daily routine.&lt;/span&gt; This means movement is non-negotiable. Years later, you are likely to retain independence and mobility because you keep exercising every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Manage stress positively:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyles are becoming more dizzying, running at breakneck, almost hypersonic speed, from looming deadlines to back-to-back meetings. Your mind keeps buzzing, always teetering on the edge. Dr Farman reminded that stress management is crucial, and one needs to ensure they adopt mindfulness techniques to ease stress responses. The reason? &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;He shared that chronic stress releases hormones that accelerate the process of ageing, which is why stress management is one of the fundamentals if you wish to age healthily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He recommended some techniques to manage daily stress, “Practice mindfulness, deep breathing, or meditation daily to create calm within. Even 10 minutes of quiet reflection can be soothing for your nervous system and help you improve your mental clarity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Build meaningful connections:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/22/original/hangouts_1763805013280.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Be in touch with your friends and hang out often to reduce stress. (Picture credit: Freepik)" title="Be in touch with your friends and hang out often to reduce stress. (Picture credit: Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Be in touch with your friends and hang out often to reduce stress. (Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lastly, focus on building social connections. Dr Farman insisted that it's one of the most prominent factors that determine how long one will live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Spend time with your family and friends, nurture the relationships that get you through life, and find meaning in your community or work,” he advised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how often should you socialise? He suggested, “Ideally, aim to socialise for at least 5–6 hours per week, whether through calls, gatherings, or shared activities.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who maintain social connections are likely to live healthier lives. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;So if you tend to ghost, avoid calls, cancel plans, or take 2-3 business days to reply back to your friends, it's high time you reconsider this habit.&lt;/span&gt; Try to regularly be in touch with friends and family, whether through physical meet-ups or calls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black tea's caffeine and L-theanine content can improve focus, alertness, and mental clarity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The range of polyphenols in black tea supports immune, heart, metabolic, and gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite containing some caffeine, black tea can also support optimal hydration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of all the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/types-of-tea-7152305" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;tea varieties&lt;/a&gt; out there (and there are a lot), black tea is among the most popular. If not enjoyed as-is, this tea is often the base for popular blends like chai, Earl Grey, English breakfast, and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Black tea is a type of tea that originated in China and is made from the Camellia sinensis plant—the same plant from which white, green, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/oolong-tea-benefits-8765855" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oolong tea&lt;/a&gt; are made,” says &lt;a href="https://wellnourishedmamas.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Jamie Adams&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, RPYT, women’s health dietitian and founder of Mamaste Nutrition. What sets black tea apart from these other Camellia varieties is the way it’s made—through a process called oxidation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The oxidation process involves exposing the tea leaves to air, allowing enzymes to transform their natural compounds, which deepens its flavor and color,” shares Samina Kalloo, RDN, CDN, registered dietitian, nutrition counselor and founder of Samina Kalloo Nutrition.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But aside from black tea’s flavor and versatility, this popular caffeinated beverage actually boasts quite a few health benefits. Read on to discover six of the most impressive ways black tea boosts overall health.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-supports-immunity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Supports Immunity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The plant compounds found in black tea exhibit antioxidant properties, which can &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/immunity-boosting-teas-8760555" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;boost immune health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Antioxidants work by removing free radicals in the body and combating cell damage, both of which may help &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/anti-inflammatory-tea" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and risk of chronic disease,” says Adams. “These powerful antioxidants are formed during the oxidation process,” adds Kalloo. In fact, a 2025 study found that consuming a greater variety of flavonoid rich foods, including black tea, may reduce all-cause mortality and the risk of cancer and other chronic diseases by anywhere from 6% to 20%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-improves-mental-focus-and-alertness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Improves Mental Focus and Alertness &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Black tea is often turned to first thing in the morning for a caffeine boost to start the day. And while many people are aware of black tea’s caffeine content, they may not know that it also contains an amino acid called L-theanine. “Both caffeine and L-theanine may improve alertness and cognitive performance,” explains Adams. Recent research echoes this sentiment, highlighting how this specific nutrient combination aids in mental clarity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-boosts-heart-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Boosts Heart Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The polyphenols in black tea are even beneficial for those with heart health concerns—or looking to steer clear of them. “Just two cups a day can provide 400 to 600 milligrams of flavan-3-ols, the recommended daily intake to support heart health,” says Kalloo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These plant compounds support heart health through encouraging both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-cholesterol-foods-7567696" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and blood pressure regulation. “A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that black tea supplementation significantly reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to control treatments,” explains Adams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-regulates-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Regulates Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If blood sugar regulation or type 2 diabetes prevention are a top priority for you, black tea can also play a supporting role. “Some research suggests that black tea may offer several benefits for blood sugar regulation,” offers Adams, including this randomized control trial.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Regular black tea consumption has also been linked to a lower risk for type 2 diabetes,” adds Kalloo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-supports-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Supports Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drinking black tea may encourage a healthier gut, too! For example, a 2023 study found that black tea consumption is tied to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-for-gut-health-8762795" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improved gut microbiome flora&lt;/a&gt;, supporting digestive health, as well as all the other benefits associated with a thriving microbiome, including immune and brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Surprisingly, black tea can actually contribute to your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/how-much-water-to-drink-day" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily hydration needs&lt;/a&gt;. “Both caffeinated and decaffeinated black tea can absolutely count toward your daily fluid intake. When consumed in moderate amounts, caffeinated beverages like tea are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/hydrating-drinks-11745806" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;as hydrating as water&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, it’s crucial to not go overboard with black tea in pursuit of hitting your fluid goals. “It's important to consume it in moderation, as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/beverages/how-much-caffeine-per-day" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excessive intake of caffeine&lt;/a&gt; can lead to side effects such as insomnia or increased heart rate,” says Adams—though these effects only occur with excessive black tea consumption. “Caffeinated tea contains approximately 50 milligrams of caffeine per cup, and evidence shows no effect on hydration with intakes of up to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day or the equivalent of eight cups of tea,” explains Kalloo.

The main signal held across ages and in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those risks are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and tobacco use. These conditions fall under cardiovascular disease, illnesses that involve the heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-heart-health-risks"&gt;Studying heart health risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Hokyou Lee, MD, PhD, at Yonsei University College of Medicine in Seoul (&lt;a href="https://medicine.snu.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SNU&lt;/a&gt;). His research focuses on cardiovascular risk and prevention in populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked two cohorts, one drawn from a national insurance database in Korea and one from a diverse research cohort in the United States. Together, the records spanned more than 9 million adults and many first cardiac or neurologic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among people who eventually had a first event, the Korean database counted 601,025 outcomes while the U.S. cohort recorded 1,188. The team then checked whether any of the four risks appeared at any clinic visit before the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did not require a formal diagnosis to count risk, which better reflects everyday care. Many people carry numbers that are not ideal for years before disease appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-four-heart-risk-factors"&gt;The four heart risk factors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study counted hypertension, chronically high &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-minimum-amount-of-physical-activity-needed-to-prevent-high-blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; that strains the heart and blood vessels, as systolic 120 mm Hg or diastolic 80 mm Hg. It also counted people taking blood pressure medicine as having this risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol was counted as total cholesterol at or above 200 milligrams per deciliter or use of a lipid lowering drug. The team also tracked fasting glucose, blood sugar measured after not eating for at least 8 hours, at 100 milligrams per deciliter or higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past or current &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/does-smoking-increase-blood-pressure-risk-urine-tests-reveal-the-answer/"&gt;tobacco use&lt;/a&gt; qualified as the fourth risk. Elevated blood pressure showed up most often before events, while smoking appeared least often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors often focus on LDL cholesterol, the particle that most strongly drives plaque buildup in arteries. Lowering LDL cholesterol reduces future heart attack risk in a stepwise fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-non-optimal-is-dangerous"&gt;When non-optimal is dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thresholds were intentionally modest to catch risk early. This approach reflects primordial prevention, which focuses on stopping risk factors from taking root long before they can trigger disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damage to arteries builds slowly when blood pressure, glucose, or lipids sit above ideal levels. The body handles small shifts for a while, but steady exposure over years increases strain and raises the chances of a serious event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people move through life with numbers that are not alarming yet still fall outside the safest range. Those small gaps create pressure that grows with time and eventually weakens the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/whole-milk-or-low-fat-milk-study-shows-which-is-better-for-heart-health/"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine checkups and labs matter because they reveal these early shifts. Correcting issues while they are still mild can change long term outcomes and prevent a future emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-women-under-60-are-not-exempt"&gt;Women under 60 are not exempt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women younger than 60, heart failure and stroke still had more than 95 percent of events preceded by at least one nonoptimal risk. That means early prevention remains relevant even in the lowest risk female age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding undercuts the belief that midlife events often strike without warning in otherwise healthy women. It highlights the value of early blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose management across adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gap-between-risk-and-care"&gt;Gap between risk and care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accompanying &lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; noted that people typically had several clinic visits before their events, which meant there were many chances to check and manage their health risks. Those visits represented opportunities to test, treat, and follow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood pressure control, cholesterol lowering, smoking cessation, and glucose management are all within reach today. Therapeutic combinations and steady lifestyle changes produce the largest gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-remains-the-leading-cause-of-death-worldwide/"&gt;disease remains&lt;/a&gt; the top &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/-/media/PHD-Files-2/Science-News/2/2025-Heart-and-Stroke-Stat-Update/2025-Statistics-At-A-Glance.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cause&lt;/a&gt; of death in the United States, with 941,652 deaths in 2022, according to the American Heart Association (&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/why-give?s_src=26D511AEMG&amp;amp;s_subsrc=fy26_sem_google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dr_fy26_evergreen_brand&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_content=161056132793&amp;amp;utm_term=the%20american%20heart%20association&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=19652355320&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADfYbP7YGJAly6Ap4vQ8zC7aVFx6D&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5uDIBhDAARIsAOxj0CGwNqfgTlJypy2RTwQr3KiYvhEMXyVdtsXk0YLoIn4bC6tVWQyCAdAaAjfgEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;). The scale of suffering underlines why early detection and treatment of these four risks is urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new results do not claim that every event can be prevented. They do indicate that stronger control of four common risks could avert large numbers of tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-recognizing-heart-health-risks"&gt;Recognizing heart health risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an observational study, research that follows people without assigning treatments, so it reveals patterns but cannot prove cause. It still offers clear direction on where prevention should focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cohorts came from different settings and cultures, and visits were spaced over years. Even with those differences, the central signal stayed consistent across groups and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will test ways to reach people earlier and keep numbers controlled over time. Primary care access, community programs, and easy to use medicines will all play key parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 20:42:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOb0ZFOUZLa056ZDNZeXMtZjlZT0pzZnh5TUh0bHJ1MWJaZXRsbjlOWlg3YlVDSGRET05tenQtbUxzYm1aY1VCUmhzOVp1VzZibWlHeDBWVU11NUlPSlZ6eHFTY0pSclBIMy1rVm9kZG9ueUhYUU5TNWNaY3ZJRlBXOGd2QWRHR2tQSU5FZWZkNW5aV0lGX2RlMGlxY01OYzBRM3NoSW9yeU1mQQ</guid></item><item><title>正如顶级心脏病专家透露的那样， 5个简单的方法来阻止糖尿病-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/5-simple-hacks-to-keep-diabetes-at-bay-as-revealed-by-top-cardiologist/articleshow/125248102.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions across the world. When one is diabetic, the body either is unable to produce insulin, or has trouble processing it in the right manner. Diabetes can be genetic, but is also largely based on lifestyle factors such as obesity, poor diet, High Blood Pressure etc,. The good news is that even if diabetes runs in your family, and you are not a diabetic yet, there are certain things you can do to mitigate that risk. Dr Evan Levine, board certified cardiologist, lists out 5 lifestyle changes you can bring about, to keep Diabetes at bay. Remember, prevention is always better than cure!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lose weight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a modest dip in weight, can make a dent in your chance of developing diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program found that shedding 5–7 % of total body weight, cut diabetes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1762038/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by 60 % over three years. Losing those kgs improves insulin sensitivity, and brings blood‑sugar levels down, two of the biggest markers behind diabetes. Experts advise aiming for a healthy weight loss through modest tweaks through diet and activity, to achieve the best results. Maintaining an ideal weight not only wards off diabetes; it also curtails the likelihood of heart disease, joint ailments, and a host of other health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Exercise most days of the week&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity nudges your body into using insulin, which helps lower blood sugar, and cuts the risk of developing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Diabetes Association recommends clocking 150 minutes each week of moderate‑intensity exercise-think brisk walking, cycling or swimming. Beyond supporting weight loss, regular movement gives the heart a boost as well. Research indicates that individuals who hit these activity targets, enjoy a 44 %‑70 % reduction in diabetes risk, even when the scale doesn’t move much at first. Staying active also keeps stress in control, and promotes more restorative sleep-both essential pieces for keeping diabetes at way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cut out sugary drinks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks-sodas, fruit juices, and energy drinks, send blood sugar soaring quickly, and often adds the kgs. Removing them from the diet pulls down your diabetes risk by slashing calories, and smoothing out those glucose spikes. Switching to water, plain tea or black coffee, gives the body a sort of protection against diabetes. Research backs the link between cutting out sugary beverages, and a reduced incidence of diabetes. Keeping an eye on hidden sugars tucked into processed foods and sweets, further aids blood‑sugar management, and supports a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fiber rich food over carbs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping out carbs-bread, pasta and sugary snacks-for fiber‑packed whole grains, fresh fruit and vegetables tends to smooth blood‑sugar fluctuations. The extra fiber acts like a brake on digestion, slowing the entry of sugar into the bloodstream. A growing body of research links high‑fiber eating patterns to a risk of diabetes, and to a healthier metabolic profile. Whole‑food choices also make it easier to maintain a steady weight while nurturing a healthy gut microbiome. Moreover, opting for low‑glycemic‑index foods, which raise blood sugar gradually than in a surge, adds a layer of protection against diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Keep stress in control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When stress lingers, it floods the body with cortisol, and other hormones that nudge blood sugar upward, and blunt insulin’s effectiveness. Tackling that pressure with habits such as meditation, yoga, deep‑breathing exercises or simply picking a hobby, can smooth out glucose swings, and shrink the odds of developing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1762038/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; now shows that stress‑reduction programs, not only improve metabolic markers, but also slash the likelihood of diabetes. Layering those calming practices with good sleep, further sharpens insulin sensitivity and underpins overall well‑being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tiny adjustments can end up having an effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes these diabetes‑prevention hacks by Dr Levine so helpful, is their sheer simplicity and effectiveness. Even modest weight loss, swapping sodas for water, fitting a short walk into your day, piling your plate with fiber‑dense foods, and carving out a few minutes to unwind, can slash your diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7wFBVV95cUxPeUFZVS1zTFJJTHIwZ05kVUFXVk1wWXR0bEFoTjFVbVM2VjE2TGhlald2cEZ0bXZsejg1Ty10bmYwdld2X0JKYnFLeUZjbUE1cTdZOHl6al9FZW1xUEJibHI1Zk5PbVNuZGt2SGN5aVRXa08yNllvUmx2cm1kZGd3S1hxc0VnU1Bic3JaQzRFWWlVZ0FvZm1lcWVQN0gwOXF5SkNqVl9mSFdUOVBFNUV2S09FN3ZlZnpOV3p0eFBkcHNGNWM1TGI1SUpHaXpHMUZ1Y3c5M1BnZ3plcW9Ib3djSEV3Xy12UE9Femtqd1JlRQ</guid></item><item><title>警告！您的头发颜色可能导致多器官衰竭；了解PPD风险、过敏和安全替代方案-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/warning-your-hair-colour-can-cause-multi-organ-failure-understand-ppd-risks-allergies-and-safe-alternatives/articleshow/125515624.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Permanent hair dyes are a popular choice for achieving bright, long-lasting hair colour. Many of these products contain a chemical called p-phenylenediamine, commonly known as PPD. This ingredient is essential for keeping hair shades vibrant and resistant to fading. However, experts warn that PPD may pose serious health risks. Regular exposure can lead to skin reactions such as redness, itching, swelling, and blistering. Some individuals may experience allergic responses, particularly those with pre-existing skin conditions. In rare cases, PPD can even cause life-threatening poisoning if ingested. Awareness of these risks is crucial for anyone who colours their hair frequently, allowing safer choices and preventive measures like patch testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding PPD and why is it used in hair dye&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;P-phenylenediamine is an aromatic amine that allows permanent hair dyes to retain their colour over time. It reacts with other ingredients to create pigments that penetrate the hair shaft, producing long-lasting shades. Without PPD, hair colour would fade quickly and appear dull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its cosmetic benefits, PPD has been associated with several health risks. Repeated exposure can sensitise the immune system, leading to allergic reactions and skin inflammation. This dual nature makes it a controversial ingredient in hair care products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Skin reactions and potential cancer risks from &lt;keyword id="30917361" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="PPD-in-hair-dye" source="keywords"&gt;PPD in hair dye&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small amounts of PPD absorbed through the scalp can trigger a range of skin issues. The most common reaction is contact dermatitis, which manifests as redness, itching, swelling, and in some cases, blistering. These symptoms typically appear 48 to 72 hours after hair dye application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with pre-existing skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis, or scalp irritation are more likely to experience adverse reactions. Studies suggest that while 1.5 percent of the general population may react to PPD, the number rises to approximately 6 percent for individuals already prone to dermatitis. There have been questions about the potential link between hair dye chemicals and cancer. The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://publications.iarc.who.int/75" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;International Agency for Research on Cancer &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;(IARC) has classified occupational exposure to hair dyes as “probably carcinogenic.” However, research on personal use of hair dye shows mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 36-year study published in 2020 found no strong overall connection between regular hair dye use and most cancers. It did indicate potential associations with specific types, such as basal cell carcinoma and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. Experts emphasise that these findings are not definitive and require further study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PPD poisoning risks and the importance of careful handling&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cosmetic use of PPD is generally safe, accidental ingestion of the chemical can be extremely dangerous. Oral exposure can cause rapid multi-organ failure, with early signs including sudden swelling of the neck and airways, known as angioneurotic oedema. Even with prompt medical intervention, severe PPD poisoning carries a mortality rate of around 14.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This highlights that while PPD is safe in controlled cosmetic use, awareness and careful handling are crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Safer hair dye alternatives and testing for PPD sensitivity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing concern about PPD has led to the development of PPD-free hair dyes. One common alternative is p-toluenediamine sulfate (PTDS). However, research indicates that approximately half of individuals allergic to PPD may also react to PTDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safest approach includes performing a patch test 48 hours before using any hair dye, wearing protective gloves during application, and educating consumers about potential sensitivities. Professional hairdressers should also follow strict safety protocols to minimise exposure. Identifying a sensitivity to PPD can prevent severe reactions. Allergy clinics can provide professional testing, or a patch test at home can indicate whether a person may react to the chemical. The patch test involves applying a small amount of hair dye to a small patch of skin and monitoring for redness, swelling, or irritation over 48 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 17:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>支持疫苗的Cassidy拒绝反对RFK Jr. - Politico</title><link>https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/23/bill-cassidy-refuses-to-speak-against-rfk-jr-00666410</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Politico</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 17:04:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNVEF6SURQTmVudzhkWk9JdExsNjBfM3AtUDFvRENkZ1ZRZW9MR2VyMkFfTGxGRExZdkV6QW1SMEZ5ZklHRENERHI1T0swWk8zQmJGMUxRNDU0NFJmSHhuSE9CYWVDQ3RSTWZWSFpSRll5R1NWS240Sm5nUHJYcU5KZ2dkaXpFUENDRUVHT1F4cnUwamdERmlnNUp3</guid></item><item><title>医生解释了为什么10000步无法挽回10个小时的坐姿： “你可以达到目标，但……” |热门话题-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/trending/doctor-explains-why-10-000-steps-cant-undo-10-hours-of-sitting-you-can-hit-step-goal-but-101763914063116.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/trending/doctor-explains-why-10-000-steps-cant-undo-10-hours-of-sitting-you-can-hit-step-goal-but-101763914063116.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A doctor’s Instagram post about the hidden dangers of prolonged sitting is gaining attention online after he explained why even 10,000 steps a day cannot undo the damage caused by 10 hours of immobility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""&gt; &lt;span class=""&gt; &lt;picture&gt; &lt;source media="(max-width:767px)" srcset="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/23/550x309/photo-1515378791036-0648a3ef77b2_1763914314328_1763914324755.jpg" alt="The doctor said that the damage begins long before people lace up their shoes for an evening walk.

(Unsplash/Representative image)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p id="readMoreFTUser"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking to Instagram, Dr Sumit Kapadia, who, according to his bio, is a vascular surgeon and varicose vein specialist, wrote that most people assume that hitting their step goal in the evening cancels out a sedentary workday, but he explained that the body doesn’t work that way. Dr Kapadia said that even if someone achieves their daily 10,000 steps, spending the entire day desk-bound from 9 am to 7 pm still harms circulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is something I tell my patients almost every day. You can hit your step goal in the evening…but if you’ve been desk-bound from 9 AM to 7 PM, your veins have already taken the damage,” he wrote in the caption of his Instagram post.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr Kapadia explained that vein health depends less on the total distance walked and more on how often a person moves throughout the day. “Circulation doesn’t depend on how much you walk. It depends on how often you move,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the doctor, prolonged sitting leads to blood stagnation, weakening of vein valves, swelling, and a higher risk of varicose veins and even blood clots. The damage, he said, begins long before people lace up their shoes for an evening walk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even a healthy step count cannot reverse 10 hours of immobility,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Kapadia urged people to break long sedentary stretches by standing up every hour, stretching, walking briefly and engaging the calf muscles, which he described as the body’s “peripheral heart” due to their key role in supporting blood flow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tiny breaks. Huge difference. Your veins don’t need marathons. They need movement,” he concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Social media reactions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the post, one user wrote, “I think I’m already facing the consequences.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“On average, how long should you be sitting and standing per day to achieve the best health?” asked another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was sitting for almost 10-11 hours and my side hips, lower back pains alot also i cant walk and stand for longer time. thankfully i have left the job,” shared a third user, urging others to prioritise health before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 16:23:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>随着传染性EHV-1疫情加速爆发，德克萨斯州的马匹死亡- MySA</title><link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/ehv-outbreak-horses-texas-21203524.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Research shows that even brief, moderate-intensity walking shortly after a meal can significantly reduce blood sugar peaks.&lt;br&gt;An American Diabetes Association &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/36/10/3262/30770/Three-15-min-Bouts-of-Moderate-Postmeal-Walking"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;conducted on older adults at risk of impaired glucose tolerance found that 15 minutes of walking, done 30 minutes after each meal, was just as effective in improving 24-hour glycemic control as a single 45‑minute walk. &lt;br&gt;These findings suggest that the timing plays a key role, i.e., walking soon after eating makes the muscles take up more glucose for energy, helping reduce the sugar circulating in your blood. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxOcTNkMWlBMm1xOVdjRG9Nd3dhTU90SnRnNkNkQXhmY2NHR2wzX05YQlMyM3gyX3dRYzlQMFJ3VHBEX0oxU3kzS1BNTVJ3bGcwWmo1QnNpakxTZDFMS1FoMEVZUDhoT0hRTEhKcXJ4YV80MkRsRlZDc2RuT3JMelY5UGxqT1JtbWhrNWxUYWI1SG1kaXMzdzQ5VUdOcGlQeEFjVmh3cG9GcklRRHYtWjRBMEEtUWJjajNyd1YtNDhPOXNETFNsREE1c2s2SDVYQ3lBYzdmVmFJNzhOcXkyZzJGeVdBS2lHbmJrQ1VwOEhYUWZzLTdLMWs2aXBocWdXYzhkSEowX001MFpGdzFPdVlrVWdqRTHSAZwCQVVfeXFMUGNHQzJOYUdYbEdYczVJMFhXcUl3TjJOSVctVk5XYUROd0NFZzR4Zmx2U1BFSWEwNHROakduQmdLWV92RzFDWlBaS3FnR0VTZGc0Q0FOaVh3M3dra0doWDNtVlNsenVjdzVYZEU0XzUzNWFyc1VNdWxYbnNQU0tnVmpoNnViQmlIUlYzSTJSSFBYS0dTVExxdWlXZlZRTkVTcGF1SXJ4LXV5cVM3c0lPWG1vZzBndWlKNG82RGlSQ19aYjhyNnBLNV9reWkzZ21mLVRGV2dDUkZ3LS13cDJ0OUpGdFlabG5fVlhQbkhCSFhtc005WWJObFRQSEs5NkV3NnIwV0NySFU2RElEcFYyd21Ud3VpNG1VdXZBNF8</guid></item><item><title>增强一种蛋白质有助于大脑保护自己免受阿尔茨海默氏症的侵害- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251123085550.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Researchers at Baylor College of Medicine have identified a natural process in the brain that can remove existing amyloid plaques in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease while also helping preserve memory and thinking ability. This process relies on astrocytes, star shaped support cells, which can be guided to clear out the toxic plaque buildup commonly seen in Alzheimer's. When the team increased the amount of Sox9, a protein that influences many astrocyte functions during aging, the cells became more effective at removing amyloid deposits. The findings, reported in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that strengthening astrocyte activity could one day help slow cognitive decline linked to neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Astrocytes perform diverse tasks that are essential for normal brain function, including facilitating brain communications and memory storage. As the brain ages, astrocytes show profound functional alterations; however, the role these alterations play in aging and neurodegeneration is not yet understood," said first author Dr. Dong-Joo Choi, who conducted this work while at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy and the Department of Neurosurgery at Baylor. Choi is now an assistant professor at the Center for Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology, Institute of Molecular Medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on Sox9 as a Key Regulator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this project, the investigators set out to understand how astrocytes change with age and how those changes relate to Alzheimer's disease. Their attention centered on Sox9, a protein that influences a wide network of genes involved in astrocyte aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We manipulated the expression of the Sox9 gene to assess its role in maintaining astrocyte function in the aging brain and in Alzheimer's disease models," explained corresponding author Dr. Benjamin Deneen, professor and Dr. Russell J. and Marian K. Blattner Chair in the Department of Neurosurgery, director of the Center for Cancer Neuroscience, member of the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor and principal investigator at the Jan and Dan Duncan Neurological Research Institute at Texas Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing the Approach in Symptomatic Alzheimer's Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An important point of our experimental design is that we worked with mouse models of Alzheimer's disease that had already developed cognitive impairment, such as memory deficits, and had amyloid plaques in the brain," Choi said. "We believe these models are more relevant to what we see in many patients with Alzheimer's disease symptoms than other models in which these types of experiments are conducted before the plaques form."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these models, the researchers either increased or removed Sox9 and then monitored each mouse's cognitive performance for six months. During this period, the animals were tested on their ability to recognize familiar objects and locations. After the behavioral studies were completed, the team examined the brains to measure plaque accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Sox9 Levels Improve Plaque Removal and Memory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear difference. Lowering Sox9 led to faster plaque buildup, reduced structural complexity in astrocytes and diminished plaque clearing. Raising Sox9 had the opposite effect, increasing the cells' activity, supporting plaque removal and preserving cognitive performance. The protective benefits suggested that strong astrocyte engagement may help slow the cognitive decline associated with neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that increasing Sox9 expression triggered astrocytes to ingest more amyloid plaques, clearing them from the brain like a vacuum cleaner," Deneen said. "Most current treatments focus on neurons or try to prevent the formation of amyloid plaques. This study suggests that enhancing astrocytes' natural ability to clean up could be just as important."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Potential and Ongoing Research Needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choi, Deneen and their colleagues note that additional research is needed to understand how Sox9 behaves in the human brain across time. Still, these results point toward the possibility of developing therapies that harness astrocytes' natural cleaning abilities to combat neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

Or maybe you ate more dessert than felt comfortable at a family gathering. We’ve all been there. But then the inevitable happens. You wake up the next morning feeling not so great and maybe a little anxious and guilty. And you’re wondering what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you may have the overwhelming urge to restrict calories, cut out carbs or resort to an expensive cleanse, dietitians recommend you let it go and get back into your regular routine. There is no need to take any extreme measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/amazon-black-friday-deals-2025-11833194" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 56 Best Amazon Black Friday Deals Start at Just $4: Brooks, All-Clad, Vitamix and More Top Brands ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 56 Best Amazon Black Friday Deals Start at Just $4: Brooks, All-Clad, Vitamix and More Top Brands &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The First Thing You Should Do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think the best way to recover from a sugar-filled night is to double down on rigid food rules. But with that approach, you can really get caught in a vicious cycle. Instead, let it go and get back to your regularly scheduled programming!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resist the urge to “undo” the sugar with more restriction, says &lt;a href="https://revvhealth.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Get back into a routine with ample self-care, tune into hunger and fullness cues, and aim for regular meals and snacks that include all macronutrients,” she says. If you focus on balance and nourishing your body, you can get on with the show in a way that supports your physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the first step you should take? Start your day with a nourishing protein- and fiber-rich breakfast to set the tone. While you might think &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-skip-breakfast-8417958" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skipping breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;skipping breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is a good way to make up for the sugar you ate the night before, the opposite is true. Eating a nutrient-dense breakfast that’s rich in protein and fiber supports &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/simple-ways-to-keep-blood-sugar-in-check-11791785" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:balanced blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;balanced blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and will keep you feeling energized and ready to take on the day. It can also prevent cravings and overeating later in the day so you don’t repeat the same cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, aim to eat balanced meals and snacks for the rest of the day. Skipping meals in an attempt to compensate for overeating can backfire. When you deprive your body of the nutrition it needs, it may respond by ramping up hunger hormones, which may lead to eating more later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To stay consistent, Beck suggests a midmorning snack of strained strained (Greek-style) yogurt with berries, nuts and chia seeds. Lunch could be a fiber-filled grain bowl like this 10-minute &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/263359/buffalo-chicken-grain-bowl/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Buffalo Chicken Grain Bowl;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Buffalo Chicken Grain Bowl&lt;/a&gt;.

Restriction leads to bingeing, and bingeing leads to restricting. Give yourself some grace, eat a balanced meal and put a stop to the binge-restrict cycle before it starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often tie this back into the broader picture of developing a healthy relationship with food,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lextalknutrition.com/philosophy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alexis Silver, M.P.H., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alexis Silver, M.P.H., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “At some points in your life, you’re going to eat more sugar, sodium or fat. But your overall habits and lifestyle choices are what really determine your health. We’re all human!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Tips &amp;amp; Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to nourishing your body and eating regular meals and snacks, there are other things you can do to alleviate any unpleasant physical or emotional symptoms. These strategies can help you get back on track and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go for a walk.&lt;/strong&gt; “It will help lower your blood sugar and clear your head,” says &lt;a href="https://www.soundbitesnutrition.com/about-lisa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “One night of overindulgence won't destroy your health, but moving your body may improve your mood if you feel crappy after too much sugar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated. &lt;/strong&gt;While there’s nothing magical about drinking water, and it doesn’t negate sugar, it is important for digestion and overall health. You might be feeling &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921422/why-bloating-can-be-normal-healthy-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bloated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bloated&lt;/a&gt; or sluggish. “Oftentimes this sluggish feeling is due to dehydration and less an effect of the sugar consumption,” says &lt;a href="https://www.arugalyssa.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alyssa Smolen, M.S., RDN, CDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alyssa Smolen, M.S., RDN, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be kind to yourself and get curious. &lt;/strong&gt;It's important to remember that no foods are good or bad, and that you don't need to feel shame about what or how much you eat. Eating isn't a moral or shameful act. This will help you learn from your experience. What was going on that caused you to eat that much sugar? Were you having a rough day? Were you bored? Was the ice cream just tasting too good? Answering these questions creates self-awareness and prepares you to make a different choice the next time you’re in a similar situation. It may be helpful to talk to a healthcare provider if you consistently have binge-eating episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating too much sugar happens to all of us. But there’s no need to panic or punish yourself the next day. Skip the restrictive diets and cleanses. Instead, focus on getting back to your regular routine with balanced meals, staying hydrated and moving your body. Acknowledge the moment with kindness, reflect on what happened and let it go. Your health is determined by your overall habits, not one sugary night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-ate-too-much-sugar-last-night-11846839" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 13:41:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1Xb01xN0MtaEFLQjRWcjlTMWg0Z1VkS2JaQmRLXzVoblhfZlVYb056eFM5SXRKTGxOSXAzajF4SzFJaXdMdjFrMTJ1VmlyajVDWkxFR2t6QUJfa0RwYjZqRDhoazhsdVdvdFlZWDRpN0xHWHB2aFE</guid></item><item><title>眼科医生建议保护儿童视力的5个习惯：吃胡萝卜、玩户外游戏等|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/ophthalmologist-suggests-5-habits-to-protect-childrens-eyesight-eat-carrots-play-outdoor-games-and-more-101763900327629.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/ophthalmologist-suggests-5-habits-to-protect-childrens-eyesight-eat-carrots-play-outdoor-games-and-more-101763900327629.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/toddler-to-teenager-know-how-excessive-screen-time-can-slow-children-s-growth-and-development-101750220424950.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;'s eyesight is under threat due to the pervasive and exponential rise of screen usage in today's lifestyle. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;While it may seem convenient to calm a child's tantrums by handing them a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-shares-5-tips-to-relieve-your-tired-eyes-and-help-reduce-screen-fatigue-101747918871745.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="device"&gt;device&lt;/a&gt; and letting it distract them, this habit poses a major risk to their vision.

A &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://ijceo.org/archive/volume/8/issue/4/article/21426" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Indian Journal of Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology revealed that children within the ages of 11-15 years account for 50 per cent of progression. Progression means that their myopia got worse, in other words, their eye power increased. So not only are children getting glasses, but their prescription powers have also increased.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;To understand how parents can protect their children's vision, HT Lifestyle reached out to Dr Swathi Pinnamaneni, consultant ophthalmologist and phaco surgeon at MaxiVision Super Speciality Eye Hospitals. She too confirmed that &lt;/span&gt;school-age children are suffering from myopia. "Excessive&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;screen time and a lack of outdoor activity are significantly affecting children's eye health," the ophthalmologist identified one of the main reasons behind the surging myopia cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"If this trend continues, by 2050, nearly &lt;/span&gt;50 percent of Indian children&lt;span&gt; could face myopia, a condition that not only hampers their academic performance but also increases the risk of severe eye diseases in later life,” she warned, highlighting the need for urgent actions to protect children's vision. It also sheds light on the serious public health burden it will become if adequate action is not taken today. Moreover, myopia's impact is not only confined to vision problems like blurry distant objects, but also to school performance, affecting learning and concentration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/myopia-nearsightedness" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="American Academy of Ophthalmology"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; stated that people with severe myopia are at high risk of glaucoma, cataracts and other eye diseases. This means if a child's eye power continues to worsen, they may face serious eye conditions later in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are the 5 tips for parents, as shared by Dr Pinnamaneni:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Encourage natural light exposure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A minimum of 2 hours of daily natural light exposure effectively mitigates abnormal eyeball elongation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The dopamine released by the retina in response to natural light plays a crucial role in slowing myopia progression, ensuring optimal ocular development and maintaining overall eye health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Promote balanced visual tasks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Avoid prolonged focus on a single near or distant task. Children should be encouraged to engage in activities that require both near and far vision, such as outdoor games.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;These activities not only strengthen the extraocular muscles but also help restore the natural ability to accommodate, supporting healthy visual development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Maintain proper viewing ergonomics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure reading or writing materials are positioned 35-40 cm from the eyes, with the top of the page or screen slightly below eye level.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Poor posture and downward gazing increase accommodative demand, potentially leading to asthenopia (eye fatigue).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Nutrition for vision:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/18/original/carrots_1750221366865.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Carrots and kale are beneficial for good eye health.

Carrot contains Vitamin A, while Kale contains Lutein.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ensure the diet includes foods rich in lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamin A, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids. These are found in spinach, carrots, legumes, and walnuts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;These nutrients are essential for enhancing macular pigment density, supporting retinal metabolism, and maintaining tear film integrity, which helps prevent both retinal oxidative damage and dryness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Schedule comprehensive eye exams annually:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Starting at age five, children should undergo annual eye exams, including cycloplegic refraction and thorough retinal assessments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Early detection of refractive errors, binocular imbalance, or strabismus can prevent amblyopia and reduce the risk of progressive myopia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;In the end, it is important to note that good vision comes from a combination of healthy habits which have become obscure in today's digital-first era, such as going outdoors.&lt;/span&gt; Other habits like maintaining good posture, regular eye check-ups and eating healthy foods also have a protective effect on children's eyesight. They help reduce the risks of myopia progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you can mix and match meals if there is one you don’t like. Each recipe was chosen with gut-health and anti-inflammatory properties in mind. If you’re closely monitoring calories, protein, fiber or other nutrients, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You sure can! While each breakfast or lunch offers a fairly similar calorie range and was chosen due to both gut-health and anti-inflammatory benefits, you may want to adjust a snack or two if closely monitoring nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What’s the difference between probiotics and probiotics?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probiotics are bacteria or yeasts that promote a diverse gut microbiome and may have microbial properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Prebiotics are complex carbs, like inulin, that provide fuel to the healthy gut bacteria, which can help it flourish.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sources of prebiotics include legumes, oats, wheat, banana, apples, berries, garlic and onions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce Inflammation: &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re trying to improve your gut health, lowering inflammation can help.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fortunately, many of the strategies to promote better gut health, like eating a nutrient-rich, high-fiber diet and including probiotics, are also linked to reducing inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Including a wide variety of healthy fats, fish and richly pigmented fruits and vegetables are all key components of the anti-inflammatory diet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For centuries, the dominant narrative of the &lt;strong&gt;Black Death’s spread&lt;/strong&gt; has followed a familiar arc: a sudden outbreak in China, a lightning-fast westward path through Asia, and its explosive arrival in &lt;strong&gt;Europe by 1347.&lt;/strong&gt; The idea that plague traveled overland across &lt;strong&gt;5,000 kilometers&lt;/strong&gt; in under a decade has been accepted as near-historical fact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new academic study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5617/jais.12790" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; now challenges the foundation of that timeline. The researchers reveal that a key source underpinning the “Quick Transit Theory” was never meant to be a historical document—it was a &lt;strong&gt;work of fiction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For centuries, scholars have misinterpreted a 14th-century Arabic maqāma—a stylized prose narrative by Syrian writer &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Wardi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ibn al-Wardī&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;—as a factual eyewitness account of the pandemic’s early spread. This misreading shaped pandemic historiography, influenced scientific models, and helped embed an idea that may never have reflected reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Literary Myth Behind a Scientific Model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The now-questioned narrative stems from &lt;em&gt;Risālat al-nabaʾ ʿan al-wabāʾ&lt;/em&gt;, a 14th-century text written in the &lt;strong&gt;maqāma&lt;/strong&gt; genre—a highly stylized form of Arabic literature combining rhymed prose, allegory, and fiction. According to the study, Ibn al-Wardī’s maqāma is one of several written during the&lt;strong&gt; 1348–1349 plague &lt;/strong&gt;outbreaks in the &lt;strong&gt;Mamluk world&lt;/strong&gt;, designed to capture the psychological and moral dimensions of mass mortality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Its content, however, has been repeatedly cited—by both &lt;strong&gt;medieval historians&lt;/strong&gt; and modern scholars—as a factual timeline. This misreading led to what researchers call a “fallacious narrative” of plague transmission, painting an image of a pathogen tearing through China, India, Persia, and the Middle East with near-mechanical precision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An accessible &lt;a href="https://journals.uio.no/JAIS/article/view/12790/10625" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breakdown of the findings,&lt;/a&gt; highlights how literary metaphor came to be treated as a geographic itinerary. The so-called “rapid spread” model was not supported by contemporary evidence—it was inspired by literary tropes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;One Fictional Text, Global Consequences&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The misreading of &lt;em&gt;Ibn al-Wardī’s&lt;/em&gt; maqāma led to the widespread acceptance of the “Quick Transit Theory,” which holds that &lt;strong&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/strong&gt;, the bacterium responsible for the plague, spread from &lt;strong&gt;Central Asia’s Lake Issyk Kul&lt;/strong&gt; to the &lt;strong&gt;Black Sea&lt;/strong&gt; in under 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This idea has heavily influenced even recent genomic studies tracing the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/07/first-pandemic-have-been-long-before-us/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="95512" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pathogen’s origins&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;strong&gt;phylogenetic research&lt;/strong&gt; has confirmed a Central Asian source, it assumed the overland transmission was swift—an assumption directly tied to misinterpreted literary evidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study notes that Ibn al-Wardī was not alone. Two other maqāmas—by &lt;em&gt;al-Ṣafadī&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;al-Maqrīzī&lt;/em&gt;—used similar stylistic devices, portraying the plague as a wandering force or visitor. These texts, created at the peak of the pandemic, were &lt;strong&gt;meant to express fear, disruption, and divine judgment&lt;/strong&gt;, not map real-world transmission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over time, however, Arab and later European chroniclers absorbed these maqāmas as historical data. Their literary structure was lost in translation—literally and figuratively—leading to a centuries-long misunderstanding that blurred allegory with reportage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What This Changes—And What It Doesn’t&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings don’t erase the immense toll of the Black Death, which killed between &lt;strong&gt;30% and 50% of Europe’s population&lt;/strong&gt; by the early 1350s. Nor do they challenge the core conclusion that plague reached Europe from Asia. But they do force a rethinking of its &lt;strong&gt;tempo and trajectory&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the study reframes these maqāmas as cultural artifacts: valuable not for their geography, but for what they reveal about &lt;strong&gt;medieval coping mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt;. These texts reflect how communities processed grief, horror, and collective trauma through narrative and metaphor. In this sense, they are closer to the psychological accounts of pandemics than to epidemiological tracking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They reveal how artistic creativity could constitute an adaptation strategy,” the Techno-Science report notes, highlighting parallels between the literary response to the Black Death and more modern pandemic-era behaviors—including fictionalization, denial, and symbolic framing.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike imaging or blood tests, this is usually done once (or a few times) in life, and can reveal risk long before any cells become precancerous, allowing screening and prevention to start earlier and be more intensive. Updated expert guidelines now advise broader use of hereditary cancer testing, including considering testing for anyone diagnosed with certain cancers under age 55 and for people with strong family histories or known syndromes like hereditary breast–ovarian–pancreatic or hereditary colorectal–endometrial–gastric cancer syndromes. When a mutation is found, doctors can tailor a risk‑reduction plan: for example, starting MRI breast screening at a younger age, doing annual colonoscopy, adding whole‑body MRI in some syndromes, or discussing preventive medications and, in selected cases, risk‑reducing surgery. Genetic information also helps family members, who can be tested and offered intensified screening before disease appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>60年后，糖尿病药物意外影响大脑- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/after-60-years-diabetes-drug-found-to-unexpectedly-affect-the-brain</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

A recent study suggests it works directly in the brain, which could lead to new types of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine in the US identified a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"&gt;brain pathway&lt;/a&gt; that the drug seems to work through, in addition to the effects it has on biological processes in other areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1120781"&gt;in the liver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13128.x"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that it acts through the gut," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/how-does-metformin-lower-blood-sugar"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Makoto Fukuda, a pathophysiologist at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-diabetes-pill-works-as-well-as-ozempic-for-weight-loss-trial-finds"&gt;New Diabetes Pill Works as Well as Ozempic For Weight Loss, Trial Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.142545"&gt;Previous work&lt;/a&gt; by some of the same researchers had identified a protein in the brain called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rap1"&gt;Rap1&lt;/a&gt; as having an impact on glucose metabolism, particularly in a part of the brain called the ventromedial hypothalamus or (VMH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their 2025 study, tests on mice showed metformin traveling to the VMH, where it helps tackle &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by essentially turning off Rap1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the clip below for a summary of their findings;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers bred mice without Rap1, metformin then had no impact &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-new-form-of-diabetes-is-officially-recognized"&gt;on a diabetes-like condition&lt;/a&gt; – even though other drugs did. It's strong evidence that metformin works in the brain, through a different mechanism than other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182622" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red-642x361.jpg" alt="Computer artwork of the brain in bright blue on a black background, with one small red section " class="size-medium wp-image-182622" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Computer-artwork-of-the-brain-showing-the-hypothalamus-red.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182622" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Computer artwork of the brain showing the hypothalamus (red).

People often find more fat accumulation in the 50s as well, which is associated with cognitive decline.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As you enter your 60s, Wint said, brain shrinkage becomes more noticeable. “Although you retain your lifetime of accumulated knowledge, your brain becomes less efficient at accessing that knowledge and adding to it,” he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bredesen noted that issues that are more likely to pop up in your 60s, such as heart disease and chronic inflammation, can further contribute to cognitive decline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Thomas Barwick via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Thomas Barwick via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Your brain shrinks as you get older, but exercise and other healthy habits can keep it as sharp as possible.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Signs Of An Aging Brain — And When To Worry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s normal to experience some cognitive decline as we age. But when is forgetfulness a sign of something more serious? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The most prominent effect of typical aging is probably the slowing of mental processes, particularly coming up with names, switching tasks, changing ingrained habits and incorporating new information,” Wint said. “Our brains usually compensate for these changes, so we can still function robustly and independently.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cognitive decline becomes concerning when it starts to interfere with daily functioning. “This is never normal, and is formally called dementia,” Wint said. “However, in between typical cognitive aging and dementia is a zone of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), where cognition is not normal for age — formal testing may be necessary to detect this — but does not interfere with routine daily activities. About 50% of people with MCI will progress to develop dementia over the next three to five years.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are experiencing forgetfulness, trouble with communication, or other symptoms that concern you, Wint suggested that you consider a consultation with a geriatrician or neurologist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It doesn’t mean you have Alzheimer’s disease or another type of dementia, but a specialist can help to narrow down the cause and any potential treatments or lifestyle changes that may be helpful,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Keep Your Brain Healthy As You Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there’s not a lot that can be done about the natural brain shrinkage that comes with aging, both Wint and Bredesen emphasized that lifestyle can make a huge difference for your brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Exercise has the largest effect on brain health,” Wint said. “Regular, moderate aerobic exercise reduces the risk of cognitive decline. It’s also important to stay connected as we age, as a rich in-person social network provides support, reduces stress, combats depression and enhances intellectual stimulation.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since many medical conditions are strongly linked to a decline in brain function, maintaining body health is a huge component of maintaining brain health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Keep your blood pressure and weight at healthy levels, take medication as prescribed, minimize salt and sugar, keep active, and stay socially connected and positive,” Wint said. “Sleep quality is very important, too, and you should see a professional if your sleep is inadequate in quantity or quality.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bredesen added that brain health should be thought of as a lifelong goal, so if you’re in your 20s or 30s, it’s important to take steps now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Try to avoid processed food, avoid street drugs and heavy alcohol use, avoid smoking ― yes, even vaping ― avoid sleep loss and major stress, and keep your gut microbiome and oral microbiome optimal,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aging happens whether we like it or not. But as both Wint and Bredesen emphasized, lifestyle can make a huge difference in the rate at which your brain health declines, and whether you develop dementia down the road. So start now — your mind and memory will thank you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:00:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxQYkVaUzhTS0VGMUh1bjlaVWg3RFY3blZxV3J1VHhPVnZYZjRwWGxDNmxSYi1jdVYxVkhQTnZHaXNsS0dwQ2h5RHpaM0kxS2Y4U3lZOTVOQlpPNUQtU09VSHNfd0xGY25aYTR3ck5TR3UyOHNka2tWdlo1TGJxUDI3ME9NajBQYUNUa190aUxLUVZrRHUzcDBxSVEwdWlneUpRNVo5X1NUM3RoUUU0LTlvOG81WnFIRm83SlhkUFRsNTFEeG1JcHfSAcsBQVVfeXFMT2o0LUY4cjBzb3FvZTJDOEpzeTBzQzNDVFdkVUZsSVAtV2pYczcyQi1JVXpOYmQwVmd4NGc2eHJTREpaVFM4Q0ctQzFFeFBCLXNvTEY5aUZiV3hpUm1DVkwyYzNoSThHTGVGUkhUUm5MOEV6N2YxM1lBbFZXblB3eVozLTB4eFMzNXZ6bUMySFpBenRZYVRVNUpQOENqUGUzdjZNMGlDQmw5LWZ4bzZBTTI5VGUzdy1hbGlqSVYtcEVHc3pGTEVVSGtieHc</guid></item><item><title>MAHA对抗抑郁药的战争- vox.com</title><link>https://www.vox.com/podcasts/470049/antidepressants-ssri-rfk-maha-pregnancy-shooting-lexapro</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Antidepressant use &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10904889/"&gt;has skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt; among young people in recent years, and that’s drawn the attention of the public health establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;SSRI drugs, a type of antidepressant, were originally intended for adults. But in the three decades since Elizabeth Wurtzel’s landmark memoir &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2024/12/12/prozac-nation-wurtzel-anniversary/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prozac Nation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit shelves, prescriptions have become &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/astounding-increase-in-antidepressant-use-by-americans-201110203624"&gt;far more common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One study found that antidepressant prescriptions for young adults and teens &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2024/07/antidepressant-use-girls-women-covid-pandemic"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; by nearly 64 percent after the coronavirus pandemic. Teen girls saw the biggest increase, while prescriptions actually dropped for boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some attribute the rise to social media, which has increased awareness around mental health, but has also led young people to diagnose themselves with disorders they might not have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Antidepressants can be lifesaving for people who need them. For others, they can create new problems, triggering feelings of lethargy, emotional numbness, and reduced sexual desire. And they don’t work for &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2025/nearly-half-of-depression-diagnoses-could-be-considered-treatment-resistant"&gt;about half&lt;/a&gt; of the patients who take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Going off antidepressants can also have &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/going-off-antidepressants"&gt;unwanted side effects&lt;/a&gt;, including milder symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea, insomnia, and irritability, and more extreme symptoms such as violent behavior and suicidal ideation. &lt;a href="https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/almost-half-people-long-term-antidepressants-stop-without-relapse/"&gt;Depression relapse&lt;/a&gt; is also common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Critics argue that we lack &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/going-off-antidepressants"&gt;long-term data&lt;/a&gt; on the effects of these drugs on brain development. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health and human services secretary, is a long-time critic of antidepressants and has called for more research into their efficacy. He’s also made false claims linking their use to mass shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today, Explained&lt;/em&gt; host Noel King spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/staff/sarah-todd/"&gt;Sarah Todd&lt;/a&gt;, a health reporter at Stat News, about how antidepressants got political.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to &lt;em&gt;Today, Explained&lt;/em&gt; wherever you get podcasts, including &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297"&gt;Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140"&gt;Pandora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah, whether to take antidepressants is a personal decision. But in 2025, what we’ve seen is this increasingly politicized language around them. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is using SSRIs as a kind of political football something new?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I don’t remember the introduction of Prozac on the scene. But my impression is that they have had periods in which they’ve been more political. At that time, when Elizabeth Wurtzel was writing&lt;em&gt; Prozac Nation&lt;/em&gt;, there was a concern that they were going to be the opiate of the masses, and people were just going to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/magazine/the-science-and-history-of-treating-depression.html"&gt;numb themselves&lt;/a&gt;. That faded away for a while, and now it seems to be very much back in the conversation with the rise of the Make America Healthy Again movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAHA has really focused on antidepressants, among other things, and the main voice of MAHA would be HHS Secretary RFK Jr. What has he said about antidepressants exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So there have been a couple of different claims. He said at his confirmation hearings that getting off antidepressants was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281164/antidepressants-ssris-rfk-jr-heroin"&gt;harder than getting off of heroin&lt;/a&gt; and that antidepressants were addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s pretty pointed language there. What do we know about the facts? Are SSRIs addictive? Are they hard to come off?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;They are not addictive. They don’t produce the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/28/health/rfk-jr-antidepressants-addictive-wellness"&gt;spikes in dopamine&lt;/a&gt; that you would get with alcohol or drugs like cocaine or heroin, which are so pleasurable that they have you seeking out your next hit as soon as you come off of them.&lt;br&gt;Instead, [SSRIs] work by targeting serotonin in the brain, which is a whole different part of your system. So it’ll make you feel more stable, but not the kind of high that you might get off of a drug. They do, however, have the potential to cause withdrawal symptoms. So that part is a genuine concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;About 15 percent of Americans experience &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(24)00133-0/fulltext"&gt;withdrawal symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. And that can be a really wide range: some at the not-so-severe scale, like a headache, and some more concerning, everything from insomnia to very serious suicidal ideation. That would be less common, but it can happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I imagine if you’re a person who’s come off of SSRIs and you’ve had those real difficulties, it might feel like, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was addicted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, even though they don’t meet the dictionary definition of addiction. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else has RFK Jr. said about SSRIs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Another comment that he’s made is suggesting that they’re linked in some way to &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/10/rfk-jr-misleads-about-antidepressants-and-school-shootings/"&gt;mass shootings&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s one where the evidence is very clear that this isn’t true. I found one paper that said that over the past 30 years, they looked at all the mass shootings in the US, and just 4 percent of the perpetrators had been on antidepressants at any point in their lives. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/mass-shootings-and-mental-illness"&gt;really no evidence&lt;/a&gt; that they’re linked to violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This summer, the FDA raised questions about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837827"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;taking SSRIs during pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. The FDA’s parent agency, of course, is Health and Human Services. What are the concerns there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So the concern there is really about the potential effects on the babies from taking antidepressants, and this is a complicated issue. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that SSRIs are &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy"&gt;safe during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, and they say the risks of depression going untreated is much higher than the risk for the parent and the child of taking the SSRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There is a fair amount of research that’s been done on SSRIs. There are some studies showing that babies might initially be fussier when they’re first born, and &lt;a href="https://pediatrics.ucsf.edu/news/ssri-use-during-late-pregnancy-linked-minor-risks-newborns"&gt;that will go away with time&lt;/a&gt; as they adjust to not receiving the medication. And there really &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/25/ssri-drugs-fda-review-panel-antidepressants-pregnancy/"&gt;aren’t any clear, serious risks&lt;/a&gt; that have been associated with SSRI use during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As SSRIs go mainstream, are too many people taking them? Are they being overprescribed? What has your reporting told you about that question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When it comes to antidepressants being overprescribed, especially for children and young people — which is what the MAHA movement has frequently focused on — it’s a good topic to dive into. Reported rates from young people of feelings of sadness and hopelessness have gone up, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/p0213-yrbs.html"&gt;certain demographics&lt;/a&gt; like teen girls and teens who are part of the LGBTQ community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So it seems like it’s true that antidepressant prescription rates have gone up. It’s also true that the rates of the symptoms that antidepressants are meant to treat have gone up as well. The big takeaway to me is that mental health for young people is a very real issue in the U.S. and something that we should be doing a lot about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As someone who covers health, you’re aware that the MAHA movement asks a lot of questions about many different things: fluoride, Tylenol, vaccines, seed oils. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve covered some of these things, and we always ask our experts what happens when you start asking questions like, “Do antidepressants cause mass shootings? Are antidepressants linked to problems for babies?” What’s the knock-on effect of all this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I think the effects of “just asking questions” will depend on what the questions are. For something like SSRIs and mass shootings, where there’s no evidence to suggest that that is a reality in any way, I think asking questions about that could wind up perpetuating stigma against taking antidepressants, which could be really harmful for the people who could otherwise benefit from them. That’s certainly a concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When it comes to asking questions about something like, “Are antidepressants overprescribed for young people?”, I don’t think that that’s necessarily a harmful path to go down. We should be thinking about antidepressants as part of a suite of potential mental health treatments that could be used in combination with everything from talk therapy to helping people feel less lonely. It’s a complicated issue. I don’t think that it’s always bad to ask questions, but I do think it’s good to think about what the potential implications are of suggesting bad effects when there’s no evidence to suggest that that would be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxOdUNZSGdKYmFweVlsZ0V3NEtZRkltaml1d2tUa296S2NGekxCSXpyOHIzYnkybzNLS2NvZmRLNFBPNUJUZG9hM3p1RWVFTEZSNDRWRjNFVHRZempvbk9uVjg5alZOWmljMExnSkFnWC1PcmR1SkdBdGR0WXhtbkhhb1JnLU1OQmNfLTU0NzB0TEpIOHc0emlR</guid></item><item><title>随着德克萨斯州住院治疗的急剧增加，呼吸道病毒正在加剧- MySA</title><link>https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/flu-texas-21191935.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The research suggests that men with higher levels of testosterone produce a scent that others perceive as more dominant. These findings indicate that chemical signaling may play a role in how humans assess social hierarchies, operating largely outside of conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social hierarchies are a fundamental aspect of human group living. To navigate these complex social structures, individuals must assess the standing of those around them. Evolutionary psychologists generally categorize social status into two distinct strategies. The first is dominance, which relies on intimidation, force, or coercion to secure resources and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second strategy is prestige. Prestige is granted freely by others to individuals who demonstrate valuable skills, knowledge, or wisdom. While both strategies lead to high social rank, they are communicated through different behaviors. Dominance is often associated with aggressive posturing and lower vocal pitch. Prestige is linked to confidence and social connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are adept at reading visual and vocal cues to judge these traits. An expansive posture or a deep voice often signals high status. However, animals across the biological spectrum also rely heavily on chemical communication. From insects to mammals, organisms use scent to mark territory, find mates, and signal fighting ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dominance signaling via scent is well-documented in other species. For example, dominant male rodents mark their territory with urine to advertise their competitive strength. Other males typically avoid these areas to prevent costly physical conflicts. The authors of the current study sought to determine if a similar biological mechanism exists in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Testosterone is a hormone frequently associated with status-seeking behavior in men. It is linked to aggression and the drive to achieve social power. Biologically, testosterone also influences physiological processes that create body odor. It affects the apocrine sweat glands and the production of sebum, an oily substance on the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because testosterone drives both status-seeking behavior and the production of body odor, the researchers hypothesized that the two might be linked. They proposed that men with higher testosterone would produce a smell that others interpret as indicative of high social status. Specifically, they looked at whether this scent would signal dominance or prestige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The human sense of smell is still not well understood, and people generally don’t recognize how much information we gather through our noses, or how impactful it can be to lose this sense,” said study author &lt;a href="https://hofermarlise.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Marlise Hofer&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Victoria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our motivation came from two converging observations. First, research is beginning to reveal that human odor cues carry a wide range of social information (e.g., emotional states, health, kinship), and we wanted to know whether this extends to perceptions of social status or dominance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Second, prior work suggests that hormones such as testosterone play a role in status-related behaviors (competitiveness, dominance), so we wanted to examine whether testosterone levels, or scent cues associated with testosterone, might be involved in providing subtle olfactory information shaping perceptions of social status. In doing so, we bridge biological endocrinology, chemical communication, and social status perception, domains that all matter for understanding how people navigate hierarchies, competition, and social connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 74 male participants to serve as scent donors. These men had an average age of approximately 22 years. To ensure the scents were not contaminated by outside factors, the donors followed a strict hygiene protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 24 hours, the donors avoided activities that could alter their natural smell. They were instructed not to smoke, drink alcohol, or eat strong-smelling foods like garlic or onions. They also refrained from using scented soaps, deodorants, or colognes. The researchers provided them with fragrance-free soap and shampoo for showering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this 24-hour period, each donor wore a clean, white cotton t-shirt. This allowed their natural body odor to accumulate on the fabric. The donors also visited the laboratory to provide saliva samples. These samples were analyzed to measure their circulating levels of testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the shirts were collected, they were frozen to preserve the odors. The second phase of the study involved a large group of independent raters. The researchers recruited 797 participants to act as “smellers.” This group included both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smellers were presented with the worn t-shirts, as well as unworn control shirts. They were not told who wore the shirts or provided with any information about the donors. For each shirt, the rater inhaled the scent and completed a questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire asked the smellers to rate the odor on several dimensions. They assessed the intensity of the smell and how pleasant or sexy it was. They also rated their perception of the wearer’s personality traits. Specifically, they rated how dominant and prestigious they imagined the wearer to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The items used to assess dominance focused on aggressive control. For example, raters considered whether the wearer seemed like someone who “enjoys having control over others.” The prestige items focused on respect, such as whether the wearer seemed “held in high esteem by others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed the data using multilevel modeling. This statistical approach allowed them to account for the fact that each shirt was rated by multiple people. The analysis revealed a positive association between testosterone and perceived dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men who had higher levels of testosterone produced sweat that raters perceived as coming from a more dominant individual. This relationship held true even after the researchers controlled for the intensity of the smell. In other words, while high-testosterone sweat was stronger, the perception of dominance was not solely due to the strength of the odor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that testosterone levels were positively correlated with scent intensity. Men with more testosterone simply smelled stronger. However, there was no significant relationship between testosterone and how pleasant the smell was. The hormonal signal appeared to convey information about power rather than attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings regarding prestige were distinct from those regarding dominance. The researchers found no association between a donor’s testosterone levels and how prestigious they were perceived to be. This aligns with evolutionary theory suggesting that dominance is a more primal strategy rooted in physical aggression. Prestige, being a more culturally dependent trait, may not be signaled as directly through biological markers like testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined the donors’ self-views. The men completed surveys rating their own levels of dominance and prestige. The analysis showed no correlation between a man’s self-rated dominance and his testosterone levels. Furthermore, a man’s self-view did not predict how others rated his scent. This suggests that while testosterone influences body odor in a way that signals dominance to others, this signal operates independently of how a man sees himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the findings provide evidence that “humans can detect and respond to subtle differences in body odor, and those differences can influence how dominant someone is perceived to be,” Hofer told PsyPost. “Scent is one more input into how we understand and respond to others, and because odor perception often operates outside conscious awareness, it’s an important but understudied part of social interaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is important to note that “the effects were small. This doesn’t mean people can clearly ‘smell status,’ but rather that scent contributes one subtle cue among many. It’s an incremental insight: the effect is real but limited, and in everyday interactions context and other sensory or social cues likely play a much larger role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that the sex of the smeller did not affect the results. Both male and female raters perceived the scents of high-testosterone men as more dominant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All our odor samples were from male donors, but our raters included both males and females,” Hofer said. “We were surprised that the effect of testosterone did not differ based on rater sex. Females typically have a stronger olfactory ability, so we initially expected they might show stronger effects. We also thought ratings might differ due to differing evolutionary goals related to mating or competition. However, there was no moderation by sex, suggesting that testosterone’s influence on odor perception was consistent across males and females.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are limitations to consider. First, the sample size of 74 scent donors is relatively small for this type of research. While the number of raters was large, the number of unique scent profiles was limited. Replicating the study with a larger group of donors would help confirm the reliability of the association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also focused on a single hormone measured at a single point in time. Testosterone levels can fluctuate throughout the day. A more comprehensive approach would involve measuring testosterone over several days to get a baseline average. Additionally, other hormones like cortisol likely play a role in social signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could investigate the interaction between testosterone and cortisol. Previous work suggests the ratio of these two hormones is a better predictor of aggressive behavior than testosterone alone. It is possible that the “scent of dominance” is most potent in men with high testosterone and low cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biological mechanism behind this phenomenon also requires further study. Testosterone is known to stimulate hair growth and sebum production. It is possible that the perceived dominance is driven by these secondary factors rather than the sweat itself. For instance, more underarm hair provides more surface area for bacteria, potentially intensifying the odor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the exact biological roots of these signals remains a task for future science, but the results suggest that body odor provides a stream of social data. Hofer explained that she is now turning her attention to the consequences of being cut off from that information:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since COVID-19, many people have temporarily or permanently lost their sense of smell, and I am increasingly focusing on the consequences of losing this important source of social and environmental information,” Hofer said. “I would like to better understand these impacts and develop ways to support people living with olfactory dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2025.106752" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The role of testosterone in odor-based perceptions of social status&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Marlise K.

While evidence is sparse, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061784"&gt;initial results&lt;/a&gt; mostly from cell and animal studies suggest there may be overlooked health benefits to this common spice, with possible antioxidant and anti-inflammatory perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent clinical trial led by scientists at Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan, 22 participants who consumed 5 grams of black cumin seed powder each day showed a decrease in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-eggs-can-actually-lower-bad-cholesterol-new-study-says"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and an increase in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-study-links-good-cholesterol-with-up-to-42-higher-dementia-risk"&gt;good cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; after just eight weeks. The 20 people in the control group showed no such changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These improvements from roughly a spoonful of cumin powder a day could ultimately boost cardiovascular health, lowering the risk of future heart problems, the authors suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-chinese-medicine-ingredient-restored-healthy-fat-metabolism-in-diabetic-mice"&gt;Ancient Chinese Medicine Ingredient Restored Healthy Fat Metabolism in Diabetic Mice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study strongly suggests that black cumin seeds are useful as a functional food for preventing obesity and lifestyle-related diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.omu.ac.jp/en/info/research-news/entry-97269.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; food scientist Akiko Kojima-Yuasa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was so gratifying to see black cumin comprehensively demonstrate actual, demonstrable blood lipid-lowering effects in a human trial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings join &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2023.105565"&gt;several other small, preliminary trials&lt;/a&gt; on cumin, which suggest it may help with weight loss and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ptr.7327"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not all the results agree, and some of the evidence is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2016.02.008"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_182469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-182469" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Nsativa001Wien.jpg" alt="N sativa" class="size-full wp-image-182469" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-182469" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;N. sativa&lt;/em&gt; plant.

It boosts serotonin and dopamine and oxytocin,” she said. “What dance does is it regulates a stressed-out nervous system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many attendees, the relief is immediate. Battani Sams said, “I know that every dance we have ever had, we have had multiple moms say, ‘I did not know how badly I needed this until I got here.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parties intentionally start early and end by 10 p.m., something Wellington said reflects real life for many mothers. “It is not about going backwards in time and trying to be who we were as those younger women,” she said. “It is about elevating this space with both nostalgia, but also embodying I am a mom now, but I am also a woman.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founders say their mission is rooted in serious research about maternal mental health. “The research shows that one in five moms does suffer from a perinatal mood and anxiety disorder,” Wellington said. “Up to 75 percent never get treatment at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of that, their next major event on November 28 at the&lt;a href="https://www.bluebirdtheater.net/"&gt; Bluebird Theater&lt;/a&gt; in Denver will include mental health resource stations. “This is not just a one-off that you leave feeling empowered,” Wellington said. “There are going to be a lot of fun activations and engaging things that moms can look forward to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image article__contained size-full"&gt;&lt;span class="wp-block-image__credit"&gt;Courtesy Moms Feelin' Themselves&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-block-image__caption"&gt;Elizabeth Wellington and Sarah Battani Sams are the co-founders of the Denver-based Moms Feelin’ Themselves.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization has already expanded to Boston and Salt Lake City and plans to host events in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For moms hesitant to join, Wellington had one simple message: “You cannot pour from an empty cup,” she said. “Just put on sweatpants and come dance with us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their Black Friday Mom Dance Party is set for November 28 at Denver’s Bluebird Theater.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Alison Richards, first noticed her long, blonde hair began to thin and then fall out in her 20s. "There was one day in the shower where I just had hundreds of strands of hair, like fistfuls of hair coming out," Richards remembers. "It was a very scary experience," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By some estimates, half of all women experience hair loss in their lifetime. And if you've searched for content on the topic, you may soon be inundated by ads and influencers touting cures. This can be a painful experience in an online environment where celebrities create an unrealistic expectation for how much hair women should have, when in reality the celebrities are often wearing wigs or extensions, says Richards, who lives in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While there are some hair loss solutions based in science, not every remedy works for every person — or every type of hair loss. If you're facing this problem, here are some keys to understanding it and getting help.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Hair goes through cycles of growth and loss&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Understanding hair loss starts with understanding hair growth, says Dr. Carolyn Goh, a clinical professor of dermatology at UCLA. First of all, the hairs on your head aren't meant to stick around forever. Each strand goes through a cycle of growth, transition, and rest. When a hair sheds at the end of its life, it's because there's a new hair growing and pushing it out, Goh says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Usually, hairs shed in a staggered pattern. You might have a clump in your drain after taking a shower, but that doesn't mean you have to worry about a bald spot. Sometimes, however, stresses like having a baby or even COVID can cause the hair cycles to sync up, and that causes a bigger shed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You know, you see all this hair coming out, and it's this huge change, and it seems like the world is ending," says Goh. But most of the time, hair loss for women is temporary, Goh says, and often your hair will regrow on its own.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;When hair doesn't grow back on its own&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The most common cause of permanent hair loss is androgenetic alopecia, known as male pattern baldness in men and female pattern baldness in women. In both sexes the condition progresses with age. For women, it typically starts at the crown or top of the head. (If you part your hair, you may notice the part widening, exposing more and more scalp).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Less common types of hair loss include alopecia areata, an auto-immune disease where the immune system attacks the hair follicles, and often appears as one or more bald spots. There are also scarring alopecias, says Goh, which also cause bald spots, often with itching, tenderness and redness, and sometimes pimples on the scalp.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Why a diagnosis is key&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's important to see a doctor for a diagnosis because it's not always clear what type of hair loss is happening, and different types respond to different treatments, says Thea Chassin, who has alopecia areata and runs the nonprofit support and advocacy group "Bald Girls Do Lunch." But that's easier said than done. It can take months to get an appointment with a dermatologist, and some primary care physicians can be dismissive about hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chassin says when she needs an appointment with her dermatologist and can't get one right away, she calls back every day. "And sometimes I'll ask ahead of time, when do you do your calls to remind people of their appointments? So you have some idea of what time of day they're getting notified of cancellations… And I will ask every day, did someone cancel?" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Telehealth companies like Hers provide an alternative option. You can answer a few quick questions online and talk or message with a provider. Then you get a prescription for medication, which is shipped to your home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A note of caution – Hers mainly prescribes medication for androgenetic alopecia, pattern baldness. Thea Chassin says she wouldn't rely on a telehealth provider to diagnose a less common condition like alopecia areata or a fungal condition. So if you're uncertain about what type of hair loss you're dealing with, an in-person visit may be your best bet – at least to start.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-98909" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Old standbys and new treatments&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Topical minoxidil, also known as Rogaine, is a foam available over-the-counter that lengthens the growth phase of the hair cycle, keeping more hair on the head at any one time. It does work for pattern hair loss, says Goh, but "a lot of people find it to be messy and difficult," she says. It's also not safe for use if you're pregnant or nursing.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Minoxidil also exists in pill form. That's what Allison Richards is taking, along with spironolactone, which some doctors also prescribe to treat pattern hair loss. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Richards' dermatologist prescribes both medications off-label, meaning they weren't approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat hair loss. Richards says the combination is working for her, and she feels lucky to have found a doctor who asks lots of questions and monitors her for side effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New drugs to treat alopecia areata called JAK inhibitors were approved in just the last few years, which target the part of the immune system that has become overactive and attacks the hair follicles. A recent review of several studies published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open found that patients had more hair regrowth compared with placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Hair loss is not "game over"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thea Chassin – who received her diagnosis decades ago – was treated for alopecia areata with steroid injections, which resulted in hair regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ten years later, she started losing hair again, and now she's completely bald. "And there's ways to live beautifully with this," Chassin says. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're not saying that everybody should reach this stage where they just are so comfortable going out bald," she say. But she thinks it's an option "that should become as normal for women as it is for men, if we want to." She sometimes leaves home with her head uncovered, and other times wears a scarf and hat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Richards says she's found support and community with other women with alopecia in online forums like Reddit – including hair loss influencers. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's always going to be somebody to hold your hand, cheer you on. And if you ever feel like your beauty is compromised, beauty gets redefined," she says.&lt;/p&gt;

Health officials suspect these birds had been exposed to wild birds, leading to the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The risk to the public remains low," the statement from state health officials said. “No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said they will monitor anyone who came in close contact with the man, but “there is no evidence of transmission of this virus between people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the &lt;a href="/topic/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; issued a statement about the infection that said no information would suggest “the risk to public health has increased as a result of this case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 jdKTXP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/23/Bird_Flu_52713.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/23/Bird_Flu_52713.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/14/23/Bird_Flu_52713.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A sign with the CDC logo is displayed at the entrance to the agency's headquarters in Atlanta on March 2, 2025.

Most of those have been mild illnesses in workers on dairy and poultry farms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does bird flu do to humans?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nhs says the main symptoms of bird flu can appear very quickly and include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;a very high temperature or feeling hot or shivery &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;aching muscles &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;headache &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a cough or shortness of breath &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other early symptoms may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;diarrhoea &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sickness &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stomach pain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;chest pain &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bleeding from the nose and gums &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;conjunctivitis &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually takes 3 to 5 days for the first symptoms to appear after you’ve been infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days of symptoms appearing, it’s possible to develop more severe complications such as &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pneumonia/"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/"&gt;acute respiratory distress syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human-to-human transmission of bird flu has never been documented in Europe or the UK, though has occasionally happened abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird flu is spread by close contact with an infected bird (dead or alive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes touching infected birds, touching droppings or bedding, killing or preparing infected poultry for cooking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 10:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNbTZFd1ZJeU1SaGFXZEZnZXUyemI2QVo3aWYzbE5uYy16UWY0bHlHTnJvV3dERU11NWFFUno4Y3ZIY1dsLUY0LTdoazZEU3lKOUVtOWhCMnVNVzFfRjFnM0pTbEh5QjBtTGNaUzRlbk56dk1yVzNIRDE5MHR1SEdtQ0d2VmRXSUhyWTRacFI0SmtqSDU5aVNxdElLd1MzSk9GRnFTU29NNFA</guid></item><item><title>皱纹是“荣誉徽章” ：如何拥抱衰老的面孔- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251121-how-to-embrace-an-ageing-face</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;b id="much-like-our-other-organs,-our-skin-begins-to-age-from-the-moment-we-are-born.-in-a-world-obsessed-with-youthfulness,-here's-how-you-can-look-after-your-skin-while-embracing-an-ageing-face." class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Much like our other organs, our skin begins to age from the moment we are born. In a world obsessed with youthfulness, here's how you can look after your skin while embracing an ageing face.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On Mount Olympus, sometime around 800-900 BC, the gods and goddesses of Ancient Greece were served sweet nectar and ambrosia by &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58691-0_6" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Hebe&lt;/a&gt;, the goddess of immortal youth. A beautiful young woman, Hebe was symbolic of being in the "prime of life". Her counterpart, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-58691-0_6" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Geras&lt;/a&gt;, the god or spirit of old age (hence the English words "geriatric" and "gerontology"), was depicted as a haggard, wrinkled man, often leaning on a walking stick. Instead of beauty, he represented biological decline, and the fear of death. Together, Hebe and Geras are just one of the many representations of ageing in our culture and history that serve the reminder: no one can escape the passing of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Humanity's obsession with youthfulness has only intensified since Ancient Greece. Our skin, a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352552524000756" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;living ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, is at the centre of this – not only is it the largest organ in the body, but it's also visible – or as one group of researchers in France put it, "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352552524000756" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;social&lt;/a&gt;". In fact, in their study of 1,300 people across 54 countries and five sociological age groups (Gen Z, millennials, baby boomers, Gen X and the silent generation), 85% of participants felt that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352552524000756" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;their skin reflected their personality&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting it is tied in with their sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Much like our other organs, skin ages from the moment we are born – so the fight to keep it looking soft like a baby's is an expensive one. As of 2024, the global anti-ageing products market size was valued at approximately &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/anti-aging-products-market#:~:text=The%20global%20anti%2Daging%20products,7.7%25%20from%202025%20to%202030." class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;$52bn (£40bn)&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 and is expected to reach $80bn (£63bn) by 2030.

I also consulted a registered dietitian to get their thoughts on these features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="c9a635c5-7870-419c-a96e-15b7aa0f09f5" data-ng-block="{" data-id="c9a635c5-7870-419c-a96e-15b7aa0f09f5"&gt;How the Zoe Health app works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zoe app was designed by the creators of the world's &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" data-id="64151171-7353-4331-b027-3aa2e2c32dd5" href="https://zoe.com/our-studies" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;largest nutrition study&lt;/a&gt; and combines several features that could be beneficial for learning more about your nutrition -- that is, if they work correctly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The inspiration was to make something that was super easy to use, really fun, positive in its messaging and to turn the typical nutrition tracker on its head, so to create something that doesn't feel like you're trying to not eat anything," says &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" data-id="cdc31605-10a1-4980-ba84-507e4c5c2c0a" href="https://www.instagram.com/dr.fede.amati/?hl=en" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Federica Amati&lt;/a&gt;, head nutritionist at Zoe, on what inspired the app's creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here was my experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1baf3241-3b18-4006-8f05-247b9d6f0c0a" data-ng-block="{"&gt;AI photo logging: It's fast and weirdly accurate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AI photo-logging feature allows you to take a photo of your meal to see a breakdown of the ingredients (which you can edit) and the nutrition facts, along with a food score and an overview of the food and why it received the score it did from Ziggie, the app's AI nutrition coach.

I added that it also had pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and hemp seeds, and adjusted the amounts accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn't always sure of the exact amount of certain ingredients in my food -- which would be the case when eating out, something I didn't do when testing the app -- so I didn't put a ton of weight on the numerical food score my meals received. Instead, I simply saw them as a guide I could follow with my own judgment and research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1f7d138e-0bc5-40be-b527-48c28ba6bd86" data-ng-block="{"&gt;AskZiggie AI chatbot: I asked it about carbs, diabetes and more&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently in beta, the Zoe app comes equipped with a Google Gemini-powered AI nutrition coach named Ziggie.

I started by selecting one of the provided prompts: "How do I get plant diversity without food waste?" Ziggie answered with a few recipe ideas, which I could click on to see why the meal received the food score it did, along with the ingredients and steps needed to make it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a test, I asked, "Do I have diabetes?" Ziggie answered by saying it couldn't provide medical advice or diagnoses and that I should consult my doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next question was, "Are carbs bad?" It answered by citing Zoe's research, which found that not all carbs are created equal, an answer &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" data-id="c4823f02-19ca-4cdf-ab85-d3526dc914d2" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/15416-carbohydrates" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;supported by the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Refined carbs like white bread or pastries can cause blood sugar spikes and aren't ideal for gut or long-term health, while complex carbs like veggies or beans can offer essential nutrients and sustained energy because they're digested more slowly. Ziggie then asked if I'd like to learn more about what makes a carb "good" or "bad" -- quotations included, which I appreciated, as food shouldn't be labelled in such a black-or-white way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullLeft"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer when I asked Ziggie if carbs are bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ti also likes that Ziggie provided factual information on how refined and complex carbs differ, especially in terms of their physiological response. However, she does wish that it mentioned that foods are not inherently "good" or "bad." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to avoid slipping into that moral binary (black and white perspective), which can often trigger and reinforce restrictive thought patterns," Ti explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think the AskZiggie chatbot could be helpful for asking general questions about nutrition, but like with all AI chatbots, I'd advise you to fact-check its answers and consult your doctor before making any changes to your diet or routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="bce91831-142c-4aab-a13a-04105600a006" data-ng-block="{"&gt;The processed food risk scale: Are all ultra-processed foods bad?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The food risk scale allows you to scan labels and barcodes to view a score that details how a food's composition and processing may impact your diet and overall health. According to Amati, this tool aims to advance the conversation about ultra-processed foods, as the &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" data-id="620542e6-0601-4ddf-8fde-d058bfee6dd3" href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/news-center/practice-trends/examining-the-nova-food-classification-system-and-healthfulness-of-ultra-processed-foods" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Nova food classification system&lt;/a&gt;, which categorizes foods into four groups based on their level of processing, is more than 15 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In some of the research that's been done on ultra-processed foods, they're not all the same. Some of them can actually be a healthy part of the diet, while others should be avoided," says Amati. "So we took a step back and thought about how we can better classify processed foods in a way that's relevant to human health outcomes and not just the level of processing, because level of processing isn't always a good reflection of the healthfulness of the food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Extra Creamy Original Oatmilk's high-risk note on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led to the creation of the risk scale, which has four classifications from no risk to high risk. In addition to the level of processing, and based on clinical trial data, the scale considers the features of processed foods that have the most significant impact on health outcomes. This includes energy intake rate and hyperpalatability, which can contribute to overconsumption, as well as the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/say-goodbye-to-red-dye-no-3-and-hello-to-fda-approved-natural-food-dyes/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;use of additives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Amati emphasizes that the food risk scale doesn't penalize all additives, but rather considers the impact of having multiple additives present in a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach is an improvement over older processing models like Nova -- it's more individualized, evidence-based and data-driven," says Ti. "I like that they recognize that 'processing' alone doesn't always predict a food's health impact (e.g., frozen veggies are technically processed)." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Ti believes that labeling foods using a risk scale could be problematic, as it introduces a hierarchy and assigns morality. "For someone trying to repair their relationship with food, seeing 'high risk' attached to something they enjoy can trigger shame, guilt or restriction," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail stickyAd sticky-ad-check c-adDisplay_container_native-mpu-middle blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe was able to build the US database for this tool in large part thanks to crowdsourcing, where Americans scanned products to contribute to the database. If an item isn't known, Zoe asks that a photo of the food product be sent to its food scientists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="1b6507f1-aeb0-492d-ad7c-a4e6be77851f" data-ng-block="{"&gt;My experience with the risk scale&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot has been written about the pros and cons of using &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/tech/services-and-software/can-ai-help-you-decode-food-labels-and-cosmetic-ingredients-heres-what-this-app-offers/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;apps that rate your food with a score&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, especially considering that, because every app has its own methodology, you'll get different ratings from each one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zoe, when you scan a barcode, you get a score you can click on for Ziggie's AI assessment, a list of ingredients that you can edit, the nutrition facts and more information about the scoring system itself. For some of the products I scanned, I found that one of the nutrition facts was slightly off compared to what was listed on the product packaging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a corn masa, refried bean and cheese Amy's burrito I had for a quick lunch was reported as having 32 grams of carbs on Zoe while the packaging said 38 grams. I wasn't able to adjust these numbers on the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe's nutrition facts versus Amy's for the Southwestern burrito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Amy's/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the only product I scanned that was labelled "high risk" was the Planet Oat milk. Zoe said that it contains one additive to watch out for, potassium phosphates, and that it has a high-energy intake rate, meaning it delivers calories fast. The packaging itself says it contains dipotassium phosphate as a stabilizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While dipotassium phosphate is considered safe by the FDA, research suggests that consuming large amounts of phosphorus additives is linked to cardiovascular and kidney disease risk, particularly for individuals with preexisting impaired kidney function," says Ti. "Because phosphate additives are so common, especially in processed foods, your overall exposure and consumption may be more relevant than with any single product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Ziggie about potassium phosphates being high risk, it said that Zoe's science highlights that highly processed foods, which often contain additives like phosphates, can be detrimental to our health because they're hyperpalatable and can lead to overconsumption. As a result, Ziggie recommended that we limit our consumption of these foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found the processed food risk scale to be a good foundation for my own research. For instance, I will now be purchasing a different brand of plant-based milk. I don't think it's helpful to label foods as "good" or "bad," so I do like that there's some nuance with the scale and how it simply tells you to "watch out for" certain ingredients, but I don't think it should be seen as the final word on your diet. After all, a healthy diet is all about balance, and moderation of (not completely eliminating or demonizing) certain foods is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I do think that people with a history of disordered eating could be triggered by this feature. Ti agrees.

It's essentially gamifying healthy, more mindful eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winding yellow path where you collect beans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to beans, you can also accumulate avocados to unlock content, including quizzes and further information on topics such as mindful eating, gut bacteria and calorie myths.

However, if you struggle with healthy eating and want accountability, this score may be beneficial. On the other hand, if you have a history of disordered eating, this could be harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-medium c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption c-shortcodeImage-pullLeft"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the diet score page looks like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zoe/Anna Gragert/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the diet score could increase awareness around patterns and help some stay mindful, it also places judgment on eating patterns. For those learning to eat intuitively or recovering from disordered eating, seeing a 'low diet score' might trigger guilt or restriction," says Ti. "Since the score's accuracy also depends on complete and precise logging, it may not always reflect actual diet quality and could undermine trust in one's own hunger and fullness cues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ae0fe3ec-a001-488d-9c25-08f2818d3432" data-ng-block="{" data-id="ae0fe3ec-a001-488d-9c25-08f2818d3432"&gt;Who isn't the Zoe app right for?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Amati about who the Zoe app might not be right for, she mentioned people with complex dietary needs that require support from a specialist, such as those with chronic kidney disease or people with a history of disordered eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think tracking in general isn't helpful for a lot of people who [cope with] disordered eating, so it's not just us, but anything that pushes you to track," says Amati. "We have worked with specialist dietitians to make sure that our app is very positive and that it essentially minimizes any risk of being detrimental. But we are very open to the fact that we haven't been designed with disordered eating in mind as a primary focus point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ti adds that this app may not be right for pregnant or breastfeeding individuals, because metabolic and nutrient needs shift significantly during pregnancy and lactation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="d20d852b-ce24-4a4c-9c4b-8f42caee11ff" data-ng-block="{" data-id="d20d852b-ce24-4a4c-9c4b-8f42caee11ff"&gt;How much does the Zoe app cost?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who's always looking to save money where I can, price is typically the first thing I consider when evaluating any product, service or app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is the free Zoe app and the ad-free Zoe Plus, which costs $100 per year or $16 per month.

I've been testing the Plus version, which the company has allowed me to use at no cost; however, I didn't provide my blood test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the app required members to obtain Zoe's membership and undergo a gut health test, which involved wearing a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/medical/best-continuous-glucose-monitors-according-to-experts/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CGM) for up to 14 days and collecting one-time blood and stool samples.

I enjoyed taking a photo of a meal or food product to quickly get a general idea of its nutrition facts and healthfulness. The AskZiggie AI nutrition coach -- which I'm glad is evidence-based -- was also helpful in giving an overview of why the food received the score it did. I was then able to use this information to conduct my own research and learn more about the foods I'm eating, as well as how I can be more mindful of my diet in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gamification aspect and diet score weren't helpful for me but if you're someone who could benefit from healthy eating accountability, you might have a different experience. As a result, I would stick with the free version of the app. Use caution if you have a history of disordered eating or are concerned about how these numbers may trigger you. If you're unsure, consult your health provider before using the app. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_adLeftRail_bottom c-adDisplay_container_mpu-bottom blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I enjoyed certain features on the Zoe app but felt others weren't useful. I subscribe to the notion that knowledge is power, especially with the food we put into our bodies and this app helped guide me in making informed decisions about my food choices. However, balance is equally important and if you feel that tracking and scoring your food will disrupt a balanced approach to eating, then this app and others like it may not be the key to unlock your healthy eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 09:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQb1VNd0sydThRYVVlZGRVdWlOMEYxbDZ4THVYX0dmc3paUmdNNlZUSTUtdHI2aVBjckxmNndzRXJYNEt2SERzVEtNSWhXNDVObkZIVl9TRGVmV3Zrc1BQMTRjbVhGc2tTOHh4UGZkTncxRXJTeE5FQ012dDFPaW1uRmtPMXFJNVdpTkhHcGRzd1BqdXd5QUQ5bHV3ZENkd3kyUnZNSW9PNlEtTFRoR1VGaDg3UU5xUQ</guid></item><item><title>长寿医生透露，动脉中的斑块积聚可以逆转；分享4个步骤，在12个月内将其去除|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/longevity-doctor-reveals-plaque-buildup-in-arteries-can-be-reversed-shares-4-steps-to-remove-it-in-12-months-101763884604411.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/longevity-doctor-reveals-plaque-buildup-in-arteries-can-be-reversed-shares-4-steps-to-remove-it-in-12-months-101763884604411.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;If you’ve always assumed that once plaque settles into your arteries it’s there for good, you’re not alone - it’s a belief many people hold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; But emerging insights suggest the opposite: with the right strategy, plaque can actually be reduced, lowering the long-term risk of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/heart-disease" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="heart disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and heart attacks.

You can have a normal stress test and still be at high risk. Surgery or stenting can fix the immediate symptom and can be life-saving when needed, but they do not fix the underlying disease process.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The longevity expert stresses that preventing heart attacks begins with understanding their underlying cause and actively working to reverse plaque buildup.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to reverse plaque buildup?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Vass emphasizes, “New data (and the right testing) show that arterial plaque can be reduced, when you treat the root causes: inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; The key isn’t just lowering LDL. It’s reducing ApoB, calming &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/vascular-surgeon-with-18-years-of-experience-warns-10k-steps-wont-undo-10-hours-of-sitting-heres-what-works-101763803593521.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="vascular"&gt;vascular &lt;/a&gt;inflammation, optimising nitric oxide, and actually seeing what kind of plaque is forming: soft, calcified, or unstable.” He outlines four steps to identify the root cause:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Precision testing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;ApoB - measures true lipid particle load.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;High sensitivity CRP with Lp-PLA2 - Shows inflammation markers that fuel plaque formation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;CCTA scan with Cleerly analysis - Identifies the type of plaque and where it is forming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Targeted nutrition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Vass advises adopting a Mediterranean-style diet rich in polyphenols, omega-3s, and fibre, while cutting out added sugars and ultra-processed foods that contribute to endothelial damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Therapeutic support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Niacin and berberine - Can help in lowering ApoB and LPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Peptides like BPC157 and MOD C - May help reduce vascular inflammation and potentially improve mitochondrial function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;IV nutrients like glutathione and arginine - Can help improve nitric oxide and vascular health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Daily habits that move the needle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Walking for five to 10 minutes after every meal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Zone 2 cardio at least three times a week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prioritising at least seven and a half hours of sleep every night to lower cortisol and CRP.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The longevity doctor stresses, “Plaque doesn't reverse in weeks, but it's possible to obtain measurable results in six to 12 months using a targeted approach. This isn’t magic, it’s science, consistency, and a precision approach that can change the outcome without a scalpel.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

It represents a significant global health concern, as late diagnosis often reduces the chances of successful treatment and long-term survival. Risk factors such as tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection continue to affect populations worldwide. Early recognition of symptoms can lead to timely medical attention, which is crucial because even small lesions may progress into aggressive cancers if left untreated. Understanding the causes, early signs, diagnostic methods, and prevention strategies allows individuals to take informed steps towards reducing risk and improving outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Causes and risk factors of mouth cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouth cancer develops through a combination of behavioural, viral, and environmental factors. Understanding these factors helps identify individuals at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Main causes of oral cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tobacco use: Smoking cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, as well as using smokeless tobacco, exposes oral tissues to carcinogens that damage DNA and promote abnormal cell growth. Chronic exposure increases the likelihood of malignant changes in the oral mucosa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcohol consumption: Heavy or prolonged alcohol intake enhances the risk of oral cancers by causing cellular irritation and producing toxic by-products during metabolism. The combination of alcohol and tobacco significantly multiplies cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection: High-risk HPV strains, particularly HPV-16, are associated with cancers of the tongue base and oropharynx, and cases of HPV-related oral cancer have risen in younger adults who do not use tobacco.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic trauma: Persistent irritation from sharp teeth, ill-fitting dentures, or repeated injury to oral tissues can lead to inflammation, which may contribute to cancer development over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor oral hygiene and nutrition: Low intake of fruits and vegetables and the presence of bacterial imbalance in the mouth can increase susceptibility to malignant transformation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age and genetics: Oral cancer is more common in people over 40, though hereditary predisposition may increase risk at younger ages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These factors often act together, creating a cumulative effect that allows normal cells to progressively turn malignant if preventive measures are not taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early signs and symptoms of mouth cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early detection of mouth cancer is critical, as initial symptoms are often subtle and may be overlooked.

These can represent pre-cancerous changes in the oral mucosa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raised or firm lesions that feel different from surrounding tissue and may gradually enlarge over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Painless lumps or swelling in the neck, indicating potential spread to regional lymph nodes even before pain occurs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty chewing, swallowing, or speaking, which can develop if lesions interfere with oral function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numbness in parts of the mouth or tongue, which may signal nerve involvement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent bleeding in the mouth or unexplained ear pain, which should not be ignored.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising these symptoms early and seeking medical evaluation can dramatically improve the prognosis by allowing treatment at an earlier stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diagnosis and tests for mouth cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurate diagnosis requires a combination of clinical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging studies.

Research found that a specific group of tumours in infants under the age of one were treatable with existing medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This had led to "many different

dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Clarke,  who completed his training at Keele University in Staffordshire said, high-grade gliomas (cancerous tumur) can occur in patients of any age, and generally mean a life expectancy of up to two years from diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His study found that a specific subgroup, which occurred in infants under the age of one, were treatable with existing drugs, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"To be able to identify a group of tumours that previously would've sadly had a terminal prognosis, where we can now have a treatment that can actually make a difference and ensure these children can survive is a massive step forwards," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0

it in the first place," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There's still a lot of work to be done in this arena."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There are many other patients who still have very few options available to them, he noted, and said there was a "constant drive" to try and make a difference and to improve outcomes for other potential subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This project wasn't possible without vast collaborations with people both from this country and abroad as well," Dr Clarke continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Subsequent work has focussed on high-grade gliomas in teenagers and young adults, with further new subgroups identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

This probe acted like hydralazine and had a “tag” that let scientists see which proteins it attached to inside cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the researchers treated cells with HYZyne, it only tagged a few proteins, and an enzyme called 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO) stood out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADO &lt;a href="https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(24)02154-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;detects oxygen&lt;/a&gt; and helps control blood pressure by regulating proteins that relax blood vessels, so when ADO is blocked, blood vessels stay relaxed and blood pressure drops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The researchers discovered that hydralazine works by shutting down ADO, which contributes to the relaxation of blood vessel walls and lowers blood pressure. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the ADO discovery, the researchers took a look at how hydralazine affects glioblastoma since ADO and this cancer have been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7822925/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;connected&lt;/a&gt; before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with glioblastoma only live for around &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6535385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;12 to 18 months&lt;/a&gt; after receiving their diagnosis, and this form of cancer has a 5-year &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470003/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;survival rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; of around 5%. Some &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/glioblastoma" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;treatment options&lt;/a&gt; include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to the researchers, glioblastoma often depends on high ADO activity to survive and grow. When the team treated these cancer cells with hydralazine, the cells entered a process called “senescence.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this does not cause the cancer cells to die, it does slow their growth dramatically. The scientists noted that one dose of hydralazine kept the cells in this paused state for days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While further research is needed on hydralazine and glioblastoma, the findings raise the possibility that ADO-blocking drugs could one day be used as a treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/neurosurgery/ca/torrance/walavan-sivakumar-1952627911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Walavan Sivakumar&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified neurosurgeon and director of neurosurgery at Providence Little Company of Mary, spoke with &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This is a very elegant piece of science,” said Sivakumar, who was not involved in this study. “The authors have finally clarified how hydralazine works at the molecular level and, in doing so, uncovered a completely new vulnerability in aggressive brain tumors,” he added.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sivakumar touched on how the scientists were able to push glioblastoma cells into a “sleep mode” instead of destroying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a fundamentally different way of thinking about brain cancer therapy,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sivakumar emphasized that the findings are preclinical and will not impact glioblastoma treatment presently, he pointed out that many things about the findings make hydralazine “attractive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s one of the oldest blood pressure drugs we have, with decades of safety data and global availability. In neuro-oncology, where many of our therapies are expensive, toxic, and difficult to access, the idea that a low-cost, generic medication might help slow a tumor like glioblastoma is extremely attractive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; – Walavan Sivakumar, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.virginiaallergytreatment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nicholas Klaiber&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a physician and Eastern Virginia Medical School graduate, also spoke with &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; about the findings. Klaiber, who likewise was not involved in the research, described the study as “scientifically rigorous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While Klaiber found the data “compelling,” he was still unsure about the future of using hydralazine in people with glioblastoma. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem with simply inducing senescence (dormancy) is that continuous therapy would be necessary to suppress tumor growth,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, glioblastoma cells have a very high mutation rate and would likely upregulate ADO production to gain resistance to hydralazine,” he cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2025 06:59:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNOVVwM0c0QkoxVUVvQi1aUG9yRkllSTV0RTVQaHpGTnd3TFJZTmM2V3hrNWY3eUlrZ05yRk1TUFIxWG9COC1LWHNDaTdOb1RjdGJ4UGpiV0lYaFRsaEdaUVVBeFZ3MnBaV3dVemRtQm5CS29tbGV5ZmdPQ1lVaWtFWUs3bkVYaUhjZVNQajNobHFWU1hOaGUwMU16Nlo5U0xJQTF5OEtDdG5qUQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
