							&lt;p&gt;Mental sharpness after 70 has less to do with genetics and more to do with how you use your brain daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother is 76 and runs intellectual circles around people decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She remembers details from conversations months ago. She learns new technology faster than my teenage cousins. She reads complex books and discusses them with nuance and insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she's not exceptional because of genetics or luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's sharp because of how she lives. The habits she's maintained for decades. The ways she challenges her brain consistently without making it feel like work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 share these habits. They're not doing elaborate brain training programs or expensive interventions. They're living in ways that naturally maintain and even improve cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are seven things that people over 70 who are sharper than most 40-year-olds consistently do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They read daily and discuss what they've read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 read regularly. Not just scanning headlines or social media, but actual sustained reading. Books, long articles, material that requires focus and comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reading alone doesn't create the sharpness. It's the discussion afterward that matters. They talk about what they've read with friends, family, or book clubs. They process the information actively by articulating thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination exercises multiple cognitive skills. Focus and concentration during reading. Memory recall when discussing it later. Critical thinking when forming opinions. Verbal articulation when explaining ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who read but never discuss what they've read get fewer cognitive benefits. The active processing through conversation is where much of the mental exercise happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They maintain meaningful social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation is terrible for cognitive health. The sharpest people over 70 maintain active social lives with regular, substantive interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't surface-level connections. They're friendships where real conversations happen. Where ideas are exchanged. Where people challenge each other intellectually while maintaining warmth and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social interaction exercises your brain in ways that solo activities can't. You're reading social cues, responding appropriately, following conversation threads, remembering context about people's lives. All of this keeps cognitive pathways active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who isolate after retirement often show faster cognitive decline. The brain needs social stimulation to stay sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They keep learning new skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 don't stop learning. They take classes, learn instruments, pick up new hobbies, master new technologies. They challenge their brains with genuinely new information and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from doing the same crossword puzzle every day. Novel learning creates new neural pathways. It forces your brain to work in unfamiliar ways. That struggle is what maintains cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother learned Spanish at 68. She takes online courses on topics that interest her. She learned to use a smartphone and tablet without help. Each new skill challenges her brain and proves to herself that she's still capable of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific skill matters less than the act of learning something genuinely new. The discomfort of being a beginner is actually beneficial. It signals to your brain that it needs to stay plastic and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They stay physically active in consistent ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical movement affects cognitive function more than most people realize. Sharp people over 70 move their bodies regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily intense exercise. Just consistent movement. Walking, swimming, yoga, gardening. Activities that get blood flowing and keep the body functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain. It supports the growth of new brain cells. It helps manage the inflammation that can contribute to cognitive decline. And it maintains the body-brain connection that's crucial for overall function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People over 70 who become sedentary often show faster mental decline. The body and brain are connected. Taking care of one supports the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They challenge themselves with complex mental tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 don't avoid difficult thinking. They seek it out. They do things that require concentration, problem-solving, and mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be strategy games, complex puzzles, learning new recipes, planning trips, managing finances, writing. Whatever requires genuine cognitive effort rather than passive consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that these tasks stretch their abilities without becoming so frustrating they give up. They find the sweet spot where the challenge is real but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother does the New York Times crossword puzzle, but she also plans elaborate meals from scratch, manages her investments, and writes long letters to friends. All of these require focus, memory, planning, and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who default to passive activities like watching TV exclusively miss this cognitive stimulation. Your brain needs to be challenged regularly to stay sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They maintain curiosity about the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 haven't lost their curiosity. They still want to understand how things work, why things happen, what's new and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ask questions. They look things up. They explore ideas. They stay engaged with current events and new developments. Their minds remain active and interested rather than settling into fixed patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curiosity drives many of the other habits. It's why they read. Why they take classes. Why they have substantive conversations. The curiosity itself is what keeps them mentally engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who lose curiosity often lose mental sharpness. When you stop caring about understanding new things, your brain has less reason to stay engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They get quality sleep consistently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This habit is less obvious but critically important. Sharp people over 70 prioritize sleep and have consistent sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is when your brain consolidates memories, clears waste products, and repairs itself. Chronic poor sleep accelerates cognitive decline. Quality sleep protects against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go to bed and wake at consistent times. They've created sleep environments that support rest. They don't sacrifice sleep for entertainment or out of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people let sleep habits deteriorate as they age. They stay up late watching TV because they have no schedule to keep. They nap irregularly, disrupting nighttime sleep. Poor sleep patterns contribute significantly to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why these habits compound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seven habits work together. Physical activity supports better sleep. Social connections drive curiosity. Learning new things provides conversation topics. Reading fuels discussion. It's all interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the effects compound over time. Someone who's done these things for decades has protected and strengthened their cognitive function in ways that become obvious by 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is it's never too late to start. While maintaining these habits from midlife forward is ideal, adopting them at any age provides benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother didn't always do all these things. She developed many of these habits after retirement when she realized she needed structure and purpose. But decades of consistency has kept her mind remarkably sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 aren't just lucky with genetics. They're people who've lived in ways that support cognitive health. They've stayed engaged, curious, social, and active. They've challenged their brains regularly. They've taken care of their bodies and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these habits require money or special circumstances. They're accessible to anyone willing to prioritize them. The challenge is consistency. Doing them not occasionally but as regular parts of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 70 and still doing these seven things, your mind is likely sharper than most people decades younger. Not because you're exceptional, but because you've maintained habits that support cognitive function while many others have let those habits slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're not over 70 yet, these habits are worth adopting now. The earlier you start, the more you benefit. But even starting later provides protection and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental sharpness after 70 is largely within your control. It's the result of how you live, how you use your brain, and what you prioritize. These seven habits are the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Ever worried that skipping breakfast might leave you foggy at work? Or that intermittent fasting would make you irritable, distracted and less productive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snack food ads warn us that "you're not you when you're hungry", reinforcing a common belief that eating is essential to keep our brains sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This message is deeply woven into our culture. We're told constant fuelling is the secret to staying alert and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/43/2/405/6371193"&gt;time-restricted eating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMra1905136"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; have become hugely popular wellness practices over the past decade. Millions do it for long-term benefits, from weight management to improved metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-junk-foods-are-worst-for-brain-health"&gt;The Junk Foods That Harm Your Brain Most, Ranked by New Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises a pressing question: can we reap the health rewards of fasting without sacrificing our mental edge? To find out, we conducted the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000492"&gt;most comprehensive review to date&lt;/a&gt; of how fasting affects cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why fast in the first place?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting isn't just a trendy diet hack. It taps into a biological system honed over millennia to help humans cope with scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we eat regularly, the brain runs mostly on glucose, stored in the body as glycogen. But after about 12 hours without food, those glycogen stores dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, the body performs a clever &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01254-5"&gt;metabolic switch&lt;/a&gt;: it begins breaking down fat into ketone bodies (for example, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate), which provide an alternative fuel source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This metabolic flexibility, once crucial for our ancestors' survival, is now being linked to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5783752/"&gt;host of health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180035" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock-.jpg" alt="Vegetables on one quarter of a plate, with a clock on the opposite quarter" class="size-full wp-image-180035" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock-.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock--600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180035" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting have become hugely popular wellness practices over the past decade. (IvanSpasic/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most promising effects of fasting come from the way it reshapes processes inside the body. For instance, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24058-autophagy"&gt;fasting activates autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, a kind of cellular "cleanup crew" that clears away damaged components and recycles them, a process thought to support healthier ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also improves &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the body to manage blood sugar more effectively and lowering the risk of conditions such as type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="180027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, the metabolic shifts triggered by fasting appear to offer broader protection, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-020-00013-3"&gt;helping reduce the likelihood&lt;/a&gt; of developing chronic diseases often associated with overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the data showed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These physiological benefits have made fasting attractive. But many hesitate to adopt it out of fear their mental performance will plummet without a steady supply of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we conducted a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="180027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a "study of studies", looking at all the available experimental research that compared people's cognitive performance when they were fasting versus when they were fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our search identified 63 scientific articles, representing 71 independent studies, with a combined sample of 3,484 participants tested on 222 different measures of cognition. The research spanned nearly seven decades, from 1958 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pooling the data, our conclusion was clear: there was no meaningful difference in cognitive performance between fasted and satiated healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People performed just as well on cognitive tests measuring attention, memory and executive function whether they had eaten recently or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When fasting does matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis did reveal three important factors that can change how fasting affects your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, age is key. Adults showed no measurable decline in mental performance when fasting. But children and adolescents did worse on tests when they skipped meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their developing brains seem more sensitive to fluctuations in energy supply. This reinforces longstanding advice: kids should go to school with a proper breakfast to support learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing also seems to make a difference. We found longer fasts were associated with a smaller performance gap between fasted and fed states. This might be due to the metabolic switch to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25177-ketones"&gt;ketones&lt;/a&gt;, which can restore a steady supply of energy to the brain as glucose runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance in fasted individuals tended to be worse when tests were conducted later in the day, suggesting fasting might amplify the natural dips in our circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of test also mattered. When cognitive tasks involved neutral symbols or shapes, fasting participants performed just as well, or sometimes even slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when tasks included food-related cues, fasted participants slipped. Hunger doesn't create universal brain fog, but it does make us more easily distracted when food is on our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy adults, the findings offer reassurance: you can explore intermittent fasting or other fasting protocols without worrying that your mental sharpness will vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, fasting isn't a one-size-fits-all practice. Caution is warranted with children and teens, whose brains are still developing and who appear to need regular meals to perform at their best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if your job requires peak alertness late in the day, or if you're frequently exposed to tempting food cues, fasting might feel harder to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, for certain groups, such as those with medical conditions or special dietary needs, fasting may not be advisable without professional guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, fasting is best seen as a personal tool rather than a universal prescription. And its benefits and challenges will look different from person to person.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264019/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

The gut microbiome of vaginally born babies tended to match that of their mothers, confirming that bacteria are passed mostly from the mother's gut, not her vagina. Meanwhile, babies born via C-section had more bacteria associated with hospital environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"&lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; is a bacteria that's associated with opportunistic infection. So if your immune system is not working very well, it can cause disease," says Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers found the differences in gut bacteria between vaginally-born and caesarean-delivered babies largely evened out by the time the infant turned one. However, there were signs that having good bacteria from day one gave babies a health advantage. The team tracked over 1,000 of the babies to see if any were admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We were able to see that babies whose guts were dominated by &lt;i id="b.-longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. longum&lt;/i&gt; were about &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00340-9/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;half as likely&lt;/a&gt; to be admitted for a respiratory tract infection within the first two years of life, when compared to the &lt;i id="b.-brevae" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. brevae&lt;/i&gt; babies and the &lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; babies," says Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In other words, having &lt;i id="b.-longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. longum&lt;/i&gt; seemed to protect some vaginally-born infants from respiratory conditions. It's possible that the absence of beneficial gut bacteria like &lt;i id="b.longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B.longum&lt;/i&gt; could explain why babies born via C-section have a slightly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00645-7/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;elevated risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing certain inflammatory conditions such as asthma, allergies, autoimmune disorders and obesity, although more work is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:58:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQYm5BWS1rbUo3OXR5SnVNd2FWZ2ZPZzBfUUk4Y0l1U3hnd0tBSDRDbTVkbm00Y0g2bEJNSEJOOTZndmdmVzFzQUtNVkhuRnhtVko1bVR1M0JGcHE2WjZLdjI2a1E3WG1xZlVEdG5SRUtrcEdIMFZDMndRMl9tWndvN1JkSDJLWE1TbjQtMFRtbV9PUmdlRlRJVVVRZFpBU2JLa0dFRUFhQVo</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病的奇迹药丸已有50年历史。为什么世界上大多数人都得不到它？ - statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/04/parkinsons-disease-treatment-greater-levodopa-access-how-to/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 1960s, scientists discovered a miracle drug for Parkinson’s disease — a simple, inexpensive dopamine-replacement pill called levodopa. It transformed the lives of millions of people. People who could barely rise from a chair could stand, walk, and work again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The late Robin Williams famously &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1885331/#:~:text=Sacks's%20book%20Awakenings%20is%20a,and%20spread%20across%20the%20world." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brought the drug’s promise into public view&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990 movie “Awakenings.” For more than half a century, levodopa has been the gold standard for treating Parkinson’s disease, and the treatment is taught to medical students worldwide. Yet in 2025, most of the world’s 11.8 million people with Parkinson’s cannot reliably get it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in. A generic, off-patent medication that costs pennies a dose — one that can restore dignity, mobility, and independence — is out of reach for many people who need it. This is not because we lack the science. It’s because we lack the will, the systems, and the plan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve solved harder problems. Two decades ago, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the developing world. Lifesaving antiretroviral drugs existed but were locked behind high prices and weak global distribution. Through international coordination, policy changes, and sustained advocacy, we made those drugs available worldwide. Today, more than 29 million people are receiving treatment for HIV, turning what was once a death sentence into a livable and manageable condition. The hope is that the already implemented global systems and policies will sustain this success even with a decrease in funding from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why can’t we do the same for Parkinson’s disease? &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The barriers are depressingly familiar. In many low- and middle-income countries, levodopa is not on the shelves, or when it is, the supply is unreliable. Patients travel hours to reach a pharmacy, only to be told it’s out of stock. Counterfeit or substandard pills flood unregulated markets, leaving desperate families with medicines that don’t work. And when the drug is available, the cost can be crushing, forcing patients to choose between food and movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a supply chain problem. It’s a political and a moral failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease in the world. Its prevalence &lt;a href="https://pdplan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has doubled in the past 25 years and is set to double again&lt;/a&gt;. Yet unlike HIV or malaria, there is no coordinated global response. No multinational funding mechanism. No U.N. target. No accountability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we lay out exactly what such a response should look like: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make levodopa universally available and affordable.&lt;/strong&gt; Every country should add the drug to its essential medicines list, procure it in bulk at negotiated prices, and ensure consistent supply to all regions, rural and urban alike.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen distribution systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Governments and nongovernmental organizations must work with private suppliers to create reliable pipelines. That means better forecasting, secure storage, and safeguards against stockouts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure quality and safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Regulatory agencies must test and certify medications to block counterfeits and substandard batches. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate health workers and communities.&lt;/strong&gt; Many patients with Parkinson’s go untreated simply because no one recognizes their symptoms or knows levodopa can help. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor progress and hold leaders accountable.&lt;/strong&gt; We need transparent data on access, coverage, and outcomes, and the political will to act when targets aren’t met, just as we did with HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The global HIV response showed what’s possible when science, policy, and activism align. We built systems to deliver daily pills to tens of millions, across every continent, and have done so for decades. If we can do that for complex HIV drug cocktails, surely we can do it for a shelf-stable, safe, and well-tolerated oral tablet like levodopa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost is trivial when compared to the benefit. The return is enormous: People who can walk to work, care for their families, and live without the indignity of an untreated disease. In purely economic terms, keeping people mobile reduces disability costs, caregiver burden, and lost productivity. In human terms, it restores lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, we are unnecessarily letting millions slip into disability. Imagine telling someone with HIV in the early 2000s that the drugs existed but it wasn’t worth it for society to deliver the medication to them. That is exactly the message we are sending to people with Parkinson’s today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a solvable problem, but solutions don’t happen by accident. We must demand them. We must push for levodopa access as a basic human right and add it to the global health agenda. We need to start now, before the wave of cases overwhelms strained health systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world once rallied to turn the tide of HIV. We can and must do the same for Parkinson’s disease. A pill that costs pennies should not be a luxury. And a life that can be restored should never be left to wither.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael S. Okun and Ray Dorsey are authors of the new book, “The Parkinson’s Plan.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dorsey has worked as a consultant to companies that market levodopa formulations, but not on projects related to the drug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;

class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Type-2 diabetes was seen as a slow, inevitable progression, a lifelong condition that could only be managed, never reversed. But emerging evidence is turning that assumption on its head. Scientists are discovering that the key to controlling blood sugar may not lie in endless cardio or strict diets alone, but in something far more accessible and empowering: lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type-2 diabetes, which affects over 460 million people worldwide, results from the body’s inability to use insulin efficiently, leading to chronic high blood sugar levels. Traditionally, treatment centred around medication and dietary restriction. Now, a surge of new research reveals that resistance training, from lifting barbells to simple bodyweight exercises, can drastically improve glucose regulation, increase insulin sensitivity, and even induce remission in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured resistance training can be as effective as aerobic exercise for improving glycaemic control, with added benefits for metabolism and muscle strength. The concept is simple yet revolutionary: the more muscle you build, the more efficiently your body manages sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why muscles matter in diabetes management&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle tissue acts as the body’s largest reservoir for glucose. When you engage in strength training, your muscles absorb sugar from the bloodstream and use it as fuel, lowering blood glucose naturally without relying solely on insulin. Over time, this process enhances insulin sensitivity, meaning your cells respond better to insulin’s signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the advantages go far beyond temporary sugar control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12175443/#Sec15" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research from Diabetology and Metabolic Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shows that resistance training triggers biochemical changes in muscle cells, increasing the number of glucose transporter proteins (GLUT4) that move sugar into cells. This means that even at rest, well-trained muscles become metabolic powerhouses, helping stabilise glucose levels long after a workout ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this metabolic flexibility, the ability of the body to switch between burning carbohydrates and fats for energy. In Type-2 diabetes, this flexibility is lost. Weight training restores it, resetting the body’s metabolic rhythm and reducing dependency on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How lifting weights transforms the diabetic body&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physiological ripple effects of strength training are profound and measurable. Researchers found that just 12 weeks of moderate resistance exercise improved insulin sensitivity by 30 percent in diabetic adults. Another &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37493759/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;clinical trial published in Diabetologia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reported that participants who combined weight training with controlled nutrition achieved twice the improvement in glucose tolerance compared with those doing aerobic exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how weight training exerts its multi-layered influence on the diabetic body:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Improved glucose uptake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each repetition in a resistance workout stimulates muscle fibres to draw glucose from the blood. The process is insulin-independent, providing immediate benefits even before insulin sensitivity improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Enhanced mitochondrial efficiency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training boosts the number and activity of mitochondria, the energy-producing units inside cells. Efficient mitochondria mean better fuel use and reduced oxidative stress, both critical in preventing diabetic complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Hormonal balance and fat loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance workouts elevate anabolic hormones such as growth hormone and testosterone, which help regulate fat metabolism and preserve lean mass. Lower body fat reduces inflammation and improves insulin function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Increased resting metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle is metabolically active tissue. Gaining even a small amount increases daily energy expenditure, helping maintain a healthy weight and reducing visceral fat, a major risk factor in diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Better cardiovascular health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, lifting weights benefits the heart. It reduces blood pressure, enhances vascular function, and mitigates arterial stiffness, which often accompanies diabetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weight lifting versus cardio: What’s better for diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While aerobic activity like walking and cycling remains vital for cardiovascular fitness, studies increasingly show that relying on cardio alone may not be enough for those with insulin resistance. Participants who engaged in both aerobic and resistance exercise experienced the greatest improvements in blood sugar control, compared with those who did either form of exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination creates a synergistic effect: cardio helps burn stored glucose during activity, while weight training builds the muscular machinery that keeps sugar levels stable in the long run. Experts now recommend that individuals with or at risk for diabetes include at least two to three sessions of strength training per week, focusing on large muscle groups through compound movements such as squats, deadlifts, push-ups, and rows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For beginners or older adults, bodyweight exercises or light resistance bands can be equally effective. The goal is progressive overload, gradually increasing resistance to stimulate muscular and metabolic adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How strength training rewires the body’s metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a cellular level, resistance training acts almost like a metabolic reprogrammer. Every lift, press, and pull sends a cascade of biochemical signals through the muscles that alter gene expression linked to glucose regulation, fat metabolism, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was uncovered that contracting muscles release myokines, hormone-like proteins that communicate with the liver, pancreas, and brain to improve insulin signalling and suppress chronic inflammation. These myokines even influence the gut microbiome, fostering bacterial strains associated with better metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, every training session becomes a full-body biochemical recalibration. It’s not simply burning calories, it’s rewriting how your body processes energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strength training as prevention and therapy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most promising finding from recent studies is that resistance training not only helps manage diabetes but can prevent it altogether. A 16-year longitudinal study published in PLoS Medicine involving over 35,000 women found that those who regularly engaged in muscle-strengthening activities had a 30 percent lower risk of developing Type-2 diabetes, independent of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This preventive power lies in how muscle mass buffers against age-related insulin resistance. As people age, they naturally lose muscle, which weakens glucose control. Lifting weights reverses this decline, making it one of the most effective anti-ageing interventions for metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health programmes are beginning to take notice. In the UK and Japan, diabetic prevention schemes now integrate community-based strength training sessions alongside nutritional counselling. These initiatives show that metabolic resilience can be built, not prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture: Redefining diabetes care through strength&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science is clear: Type-2 diabetes is not solely a disease of excess sugar, but of weakened muscle metabolism. The surprising path to remission doesn’t always start with medication; sometimes, it begins with a barbell or resistance band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By rebuilding muscle, individuals reclaim control over their body’s most powerful glucose-regulating organ. For millions living with or at risk of diabetes, this discovery represents more than just exercise, it’s empowerment through strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

It’s not just a “smoker’s disease” non-smokers are increasingly being diagnosed too, thanks to air pollution, passive smoke, and genetic factors. The scary part? Early symptoms often feel harmless, a lingering cough, breathlessness, or fatigue that most people brush off. But catching it early makes all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month is about spreading awareness, encouraging regular screenings like low-dose CT scans for those at risk, and reminding everyone that quitting smoking really does save lives. Even better, lung health can bounce back with time, good nutrition, and clean air habits. So if you’ve been ignoring that cough or skipping your health checks, maybe November’s the perfect time to start paying attention,because your lungs are literally your life’s breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;8 yoga poses to improve lung capacity and strengthen respiratory muscles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Associate Director &amp;amp; Unit Head, Surgical Oncology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Shalimar Bagh and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Chairman, Surgical Oncology, Andromeda Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the early warning signs and symptoms of lung cancer that people often overlook?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people dismiss the early signs of lung cancer because they resemble common chest or seasonal issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cough that lingers for weeks, mild chest discomfort, hoarseness, or breathlessness on routine activities can all be early indicators. Some may notice fatigue or recurrent chest infections. Even small traces of blood in sputum should never be ignored and need medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages, lung cancer is often hard to detect as the symptoms are considered to be minor. The symptoms include a cough which persists for more than three weeks, blood in sputum, shortness of breath without explanation, frequent chest infections, pain in the chest or back, changes in the voice, loss of weight, or tiredness. These symptoms should always be taken seriously, particularly by smokers or those living in polluted areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does smoking increase the risk of lung cancer, and are non-smokers equally vulnerable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Both the experts say:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cigarette smoke contains thousands of harmful chemicals — many of which are carcinogens that damage DNA in lung cells. The longer and heavier a person smokes, the greater their chance of developing lung cancer. But non-smokers aren’t completely safe — prolonged exposure to air pollution, secondhand smoke, or genetic factors can also trigger cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the most effective ways to reduce the risk of developing lung cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most powerful step to prevent lung cancer is to quit smoking completely—there’s no safe limit. Avoid secondhand smoke, reduce exposure to air pollution and workplace chemicals, and keep your home well-ventilated. Use air purifiers, clean-burning fuels, and wear protective masks on high-pollution days. People with a history of heavy smoking should discuss annual low-dose CT scans with their doctor for early detection. Regular health checkups and vaccinations for flu and pneumonia further support long-term lung health. Striking out smoking and improving air quality together create a strong defense against lung damage and cancer," advise the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does diet, exercise, and overall lifestyle influence lung health and cancer prevention?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good nutrition and regular exercise make a real difference. Foods rich in antioxidants—like leafy greens, fruits, and nuts—help protect cells from damage. Physical activity keeps the lungs strong and supports better oxygen flow. Avoiding processed foods, alcohol, and polluted environments also goes a long way in preserving lung health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life that is well-balanced is the main factor to lung immunity. Include antioxidant-rich food such as fruits, green leafy vegetables, turmeric, and nuts in your diet and at the same time cut down on fried or processed foods. Dedicate 30 to 45 minutes for daily exercise which will increase your lung capacity. If you are at a healthy weight, restrict alcohol intake, and practice relaxation methods and deep-breathing exercises such as pranayama, then your lungs will be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should ex-smokers do to lower their long-term lung cancer risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do not start smoking again and have yearly lung check-ups. People between 50-80 years old with a history of heavy smoking may consider getting low-dose CT scans. Along with this, eating healthy, staying active, and avoiding exposure to pollutants and smoke from others are some of the measures that can be taken. These actions will bring down the risk of lung cancer in ex-smokers and promote good respiratory health," recommends Dr Goel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even after quitting, it’s important to stay committed to a healthy lifestyle. Eat well, exercise regularly, and go for periodic health checks. Discuss lung screening with your doctor, especially if you smoked for several years. The body continues to heal over time—lung function and risk both improve steadily after quitting," advises Dr Pachaury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the biggest myths or misconceptions about lung cancer that you’d like to correct?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth is that lung cancer only affects smokers, but anyone can develop it — though smoking remains the leading cause. Non-smokers face risks from air pollution, secondhand smoke, and genetic factors. Another misconception is that quitting smoking doesn’t help once damage is done, which is completely false. The benefits of quitting begin within weeks, and the risk keeps dropping every year. Early detection offers the best chance of cure, and newer therapies continue to improve survival. Persistent cough or breathlessness should never be ignored, and no herbal remedy can reverse the DNA damage caused by smoking, say the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxNY2RQVFd1ZVlzdHRSQTQ4TEJjbGQzLW5QWUd2TFNLSWh1Tm5sUzloVllLUmFKTUFpeEF3RkVSVkM1WWZ0THBKOTdNNWNoOGZySDREejBpVXdYV1ZKUkNMeWpGZ2NsWHJxWng4QnJBWWpsbXg5cFdfZzlxUzlfdVVQMFNfbVQ1Q01kaDFHZk5ITG5OYl94UHI3Z0g0c2ZlNkNTVzVHWEFtcHBnZVYxQ3htVnd3YWhDdjgyclRLLTEyUWJBbERWWEZRMnJic2kwdWZaNC1DNFZsam41TmdURHNTM2RpSG5tbWhGb01yeGwyR2M3NlhfZVFDTmxSeG5FRGROanNqdzhTbTdicHdlblp2WFFlUkxsVmxDNERhcnczT0FEZEFQZmtF</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，分区可能是您大脑的冲洗周期- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/zoning-out-may-be-your-brains-rinse-cycle-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We're all familiar with the feeling of zoning out, especially when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;we're sleep-deprived&lt;/a&gt;. A new study suggests these brief wanderings of attention are our brain's attempts to catch up on maintenance that usually happens while we snooze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), used brain measurements taken by both electroencephalogram (EEG) caps and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periods of zoning out – or "attentional failures", in the words of the study – were accompanied by a wave of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-vital-fluid-protects-your-most-important-organ-what-happens-if-it-fails"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; (CSF) flowing out of the brain, before it returned a second or two later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;Fragments of Bacteria in Our Gut May Lull Our Brains to Sleep at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns matched the waves of CSF that usually happen during &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;. The thinking is that this nightly fluid flow helps wash away waste products that build up during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn't see them," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Laura Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, they come with an attentional trade-off, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179946" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CerebralSpinalFluidFlowWhenAwake-642x314.png" alt="A graph with two lines, one red and the other blue, charting fluid flows in the sleep-derived versus well-rested brain.

Unsurprisingly, their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt; during the study tests was generally worse when they hadn't gotten any shut-eye the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While zoning out occasionally happened &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;after a full night's slumber&lt;/a&gt;, it was much more common after the participants had stayed awake all night.

Higher flows were recorded when reaction times slowed down (C; data from one test run is shown). (Yang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Neurosci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Zinong Yang, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your brain's fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that sleep is absolutely essential to our health and well-being.

&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — A North Phoenix family is mourning the loss of 12-year-old Dylan Skalina, who &lt;a href="/video/news/local/valley/valley-12-year-old-collapses-during-trick-or-treating-later-dies-of-brain-bleed/75-fd921cf3-20fd-494c-9311-2b555d807723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;died after suffering a fatal brain aneurysm on Halloween&lt;/a&gt; night—but even in their grief, they are finding ways to give others hope.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan had just finished trick-or-treating with friends on Friday when he suddenly collapsed. He was rushed to Phoenix Children’s Hospital, where doctors discovered a devastating brain bleed. Despite their efforts, Dylan died on Nov. 1.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was so loved,” his mother, Megan, said. “I knew we were loved, but I didn’t realize how strong of a bond he had with all of his friends.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends and classmates visited Dylan’s bedside in his final hours to say goodbye to the boy many describe as kind, selfless, and full of joy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan lived with Type 1 diabetes and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that also affects his sisters, Alexis and Kaylie. The family believes the condition caused Dylan’s muscles to hyperextend inside his brain, triggering the fatal aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My legs hurt because of Ehlers-Danlos, like my muscles hyperextend. If my muscles hyperextend, I can't move my leg for like a minute until they go back," Alexis said. "It's a thing that you have to live with every day."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though their loss is unimaginable, the Skalina family is finding strength in knowing that Dylan’s life will continue to make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His pancreas will be used for diabetes research, a cause he cared deeply about, and his organs and tissues will be donated to help others. Doctors estimate his gift could save or improve the lives of more than 300 people.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He used to joke that he had a ‘bum pancreas,’” his mother recalled. “But now they can use it to help find a cure for Type 1 diabetes—one of his biggest goals in life.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning at Phoenix Children’s Hospital, staff and family members will hold an Honor Walk for Dylan: a solemn tribute to organ donors who give the gift of life to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to him,” Megan said. “I know he’s watching and realizes how many people he’s going to help.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Dylan’s selflessness, his family hopes others will learn about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, organ donation, and the power of one young life to change so many others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The Virginia Department of Health is also reporting significant increases in emergency department and urgent care visits for hand, foot and mouth disease. Compared with previous years, in Virginia and West Virginia, there has been a notable increase in reported outbreaks, with schools and day care centers accounting for the majority of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;SEE ALSO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/150-unvaccinated-students-south-carolina-quarantining-measles-exposure/17998234/"&gt; Over 150 unvaccinated students in South Carolina quarantining after measles exposure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;What is hand, foot and mouth disease, and what causes it? How is it spread? What are the symptoms, and how long do they last? Can adults also get it? How is it diagnosed and treated?

What steps can families take to help prevent infection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University, previously served as Baltimore's health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;What is hand, foot and mouth disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects infants and young children. It's caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. It is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease, which affects farm animals like cattle, sheep, pigs and goats and does not infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease gets its name from the small blister-like sores it causes on the hands and feet and inside the mouth. While the illness can be uncomfortable, it is generally mild and resolves on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;How is it spread, and who is most at risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads very easily through close personal contact and contaminated surfaces. A person can become infected after being exposed to droplets released when someone with the illness coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread through touching an infected person, such as during hugging, kissing, or sharing cups and utensils.&lt;br class=" "&gt;The virus is present in stool as well, so changing diapers or helping a sick child in the bathroom can lead to infection if hands aren't washed thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It can also spread when someone touches objects or surfaces like toys or doorknobs that have the virus on them, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. Rarely, people can become infected by swallowing contaminated recreational water, such as from a pool that hasn't been properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Young children are most at risk because their immune systems are still developing, and they are more likely to struggle with personal hygiene and share toys and have close contact with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the symptoms, and how long do they last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;The first sign of the disease is usually a fever, followed by a sore throat and a general feeling of being unwell. These flu-like symptoms typically start three to five days after catching the virus. A day or two later, small painful spots can develop inside the mouth, often on the tongue, gums or inner cheeks. These spots can turn into tiny blisters or ulcers, making it uncomfortable for children to eat or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Around the same time, a rash can appear on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the buttocks, legs or arms. The rash may look like flat red spots or small bumps that can form blisters, but it typically doesn't itch.&lt;br class=" "&gt;Some children have the mouth sores without the rash, while others have the rash without any sores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Most cases are mild and clear up on their own in about a week to 10 days. During that time, it's important to keep children well hydrated, since mouth pain can make them less willing to drink fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Can adults also get it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, although it's much more common in young children. Because most people are first exposed during childhood, adults often have some immunity. Still, anyone who hasn't been infected before or whose immune system is weakened can catch it through close contact with someone who is sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When teenagers or adults do get hand, foot and mouth disease, symptoms are usually mild or may not appear at all. Some adults may have only a sore throat or mild rash without the typical mouth sores or blisters. However, they can still spread the virus to others, including young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; How is hand, foot and mouth disease diagnosed and treated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Health care providers usually diagnose the disease based on the characteristic symptoms and recent exposure to other sick children. A physical exam is typically enough to confirm the diagnosis. In rare cases, if the illness looks unusual or severe, the clinician may collect a throat swab or stool sample to test for the specific virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no specific medicine that cures hand, foot and mouth disease. Because it's caused by a virus, antibiotics do not help. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can reduce fever and mouth pain, and cool, soft foods or cold drinks can make eating and drinking more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Staying hydrated is the most important part of care, since mouth sores can make swallowing painful and dehydration can develop quickly in young children. Most cases clear up on their own without complications, but parents should contact a doctor if a child cannot keep fluids down, has a high fever lasting more than a few days or seems unusually drowsy or irritable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;Should parents keep children home from school or day care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Because hand, foot and mouth disease tends to be mild, children don't need to stay home for the entire illness. The guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is that they can return to school or day care once they no longer have a fever, feel well enough to take part in normal activities, and can manage any mouth sores without excessive drooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Parents should also check with their school or day care, since specific policies may vary. The CDC cautions that in some situations, such as during an outbreak, the local health department may ask families to keep affected children home temporarily to help limit further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there steps families can take to help prevent infection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Regular and thorough handwashing is one of the most effective protective measures. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper, before preparing or eating food, and after blowing the nose or coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Covering coughs and sneezes, ideally using a disposable tissue or the crook of the elbow, can help stop the spread of virus-laden droplets. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. And people should also avoid close personal contact with infected individuals. This means no sharing of drinks, utensils, toothbrushes or towels, and keeping hugs or kisses to a minimum if someone is ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;The-CNN-Wire &amp;amp; 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

"One of my gym friends is on [weight loss] jabs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Baxi says he refused, asking him what he would do after losing 10kg on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Stop, and the weight comes back. Keep going, and without exercise you'll start losing muscle instead. These medicines aren't a substitute for a proper diet or lifestyle change," he told him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Such conversations are becoming increasingly common as demand for weight-loss drugs explodes in urban India - a country with the world's second-largest number of overweight adults and more than 77 million people with Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Originally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs are now being hailed as game changers for weight loss, offering results that few previous treatments could match. Yet their growing popularity has also raised difficult questions - about the need for medical supervision, the risks of misuse and the blurred line between treatment and lifestyle enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"These are the most powerful weight-loss drugs we've ever seen. Many such drugs have come and gone, but nothing compares to these," says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Two new drugs dominate India's fast-growing weight-loss market. One is semaglutide, sold by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk as Rybelsus (oral) and Wegovy (injectable) - while Ozempic (injectable) has been approved for diabetes in India but is not yet available for obesity. The other is tirzepatide, marketed by American drugmaker Eli Lilly as Mounjaro, primarily for diabetes but increasingly used for weight loss in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Both belong to a class known as GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger. By slowing digestion and acting on the brain's appetite centres, they make people feel full faster and stay full longer. Taken once a week, most of these drugs are self-injected in the arm, thigh or stomach.

Prolonged use without exercise or strength training can also strip away muscle along with fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Also, not everyone responds to GLP-1 drugs, and most plateau after losing about 15% of their body weight. Side effects range from nausea and diarrhoea to rarer risks such as gallstones, pancreatitis and muscle loss. India's high-carb, low-protein diet already fuels sarcopenic obesity - the loss of muscle alongside fat gain - and weight loss without adequate protein or exercise can make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"With all the media hype and social media buzz, these drugs have become something of a craze among affluent Indians eager to shed a few kilos," says Dr Baxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The frenzy, a Delhi-based physician recalls, was evident even at a recent medical conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Three months after the launch of a new drug, I'd treated about a hundred patients. A colleague said he'd done over a thousand - most using imported jabs bought on the black market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;India's anti-obesity drug market has surged from $16m in 2021 to nearly $100m today - a more than sixfold jump in five years, according to Pharmarack, a research firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Novo Nordisk leads the market with its semaglutide brands, with Rybelsus alone accounting for nearly two-thirds of the market since its 2022 launch, according to the firm. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide (marketed as Mounjaro), launched earlier this year, had become India's second-bestselling branded drug by September, according to Pharmarack. Each monthly injectable pen - four weekly doses - of these drugs costs between 14,000-27,000 rupees ($157–300), steep for most Indians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg via Getty Images A Public Health Foundation of India worker conducts a blood glucose test for a patient during a free door-to-door screening program funded by Eli Lilly &amp;amp; Co. at a home in the farming village of Thana kalan, Haryana, India, on Thursday, July 13, 2017.

Come March, the patent for semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy - expires here, potentially unleashing a flood of cheaper generics and making them more accessible. Jefferies, an investment bank, calls it a "magic pill moment" for India, predicting the semaglutide market could reach $1bn with the right pricing, uptake, and government incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"What we have heard is that nearly a dozen companies are already ready with generic versions of Rybelsus, the oral drug," says Sheetal Sapale, vice-president at Pharmarack. "But as affordability improves, the risk of misuse rises too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors tell stories of patients being put on high dosage of weight-loss drugs by gym trainers, dieticians and beauty clinics with no authority to prescribe them. Some online pharmacies are delivering drugs after a cursory phone consultation in the absence of a prescription. Beauticians offer "bridal packages" promising rapid slimming before the big day. There are fears of spurious medicines flooding the market. Federal minister Jitendra Singh has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2157298" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;"advised caution"&lt;/a&gt; on the new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"One patient asked me if these new medicines could help his daughter lose seven kilos before her wedding - in three months," recalls Dr Bhaumik Kamdar, a Mumbai-based chest physician. "He wanted to know if they really work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One challenge in India, doctors say, is the way people perceive obesity - and how that shapes attitudes toward weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Most don't realise that obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease," says Dr Muffazal Lakhdawala, a Mumbai-based bariatric surgeon.  "Many people with chronic obesity try crash diets, lose some weight, then regain even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Here, if you're overweight, people assume you're well-fed and affluent. We've gone so far in avoiding the elephant in the room that we've normalised it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Obesity, doctors warn, is a gateway to a host of diseases. "It's linked to at least 20 cancers, infertility, osteoarthritis and fatty liver - now one of the leading causes of cirrhosis," says Dr Lakhdawala. Yet, despite it affecting nearly one in eight people globally, there's still no universal consensus on how to define or classify obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The arrival of these drugs has changed the conversation - obesity is now being treated as a disease, not just a lifestyle issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors across specialities are now turning to weight-loss drugs for more than just obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Two men performing squats with dumbbells in an open outdoor environment.

From just 200 procedures in 2004, the number soared to 40,000 in 2022 - a 200-fold rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Surgeons like Dr Lakdawala now run multidisciplinary programmes where patients on weight-loss drugs are first guided by endocrinologists, nutritionists, and psychologists for three to six months. "We don't hand out drugs casually," he says. "Those who don't respond to the drugs or have severe obesity are then considered for surgery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His message to the growing number of urban Indians seeking quick fixes is blunt: "Don't use the drugs for cosmetic weight loss - use it for life-threatening weight gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And for those chasing quick fixes to shed just five or 10kg?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He has simpler advice: "Cut out sugar - it's the biggest evil.

			&lt;p&gt;Specially engineered 'young' immune cells could help to reverse the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-critical-age-when-your-thinking-begins-to-decline"&gt;effects of aging&lt;/a&gt; and the damage to brain cells caused by diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="179027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their natural state, these immune cells are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononuclear_phagocyte_system"&gt;mononuclear phagocytes&lt;/a&gt;, and they flow around the body, cleaning up waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we get older, however, these immune-cell cleaners &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2020.12.003"&gt;get a bit sloppy&lt;/a&gt;, clearing away less cellular debris and triggering more inflammation than before. Inflammation and protein aggregation are features of many age-related diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-hidden-in-the-brain-may-reveal-alzheimers-years-in-advance"&gt;including Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the US produced replacement squads of mononuclear phagocytes, using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"&gt;human induced pluripotent stem cells&lt;/a&gt; – starter cells that can be reprogrammed into many different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;Alzheimer's And Cancer May Soon Be Treated With Sounds We Can't Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mice-hippocampus-enzyme-discovery-anti-aging-therapy"&gt;transfusions of blood&lt;/a&gt; or plasma from young mice improved cognitive decline in older mice, but that is difficult to translate into a therapy," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Clive Svendsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our approach was to use young immune cells that we can manufacture in the lab – and we found that they have beneficial effects in both aging mice and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179030" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask.jpg" alt="Immune cells graph" class="wp-image-179030 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask-600x608.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179030" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Older mice injected with 'young' immune cells (Aging iMP) performed as well as younger animals (injected with saline as a control) on novel object location tasks.

Like microglia, these mossy cells can be hit by old age and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers of mossy cells decline with aging and Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist and lead author Alexandra Moser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did not see that decline in mice receiving young mononuclear phagocytes, and we believe this may be responsible for some of the memory improvements that we observed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers originally hypothesized that mononuclear phagocytes could be part of the reason that blood plasma and bone marrow transfusions have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3569"&gt;the rejuvenating effects&lt;/a&gt; they do, and that idea was supported by the results here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the engineered immune cells that Moser and colleagues injected into mice didn't appear to reach the animals' brains, so the researchers figured the observed effects must be down to something produced by fitter, stronger mononuclear phagocytes circulating in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'young' cells may have released anti-aging proteins or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_vesicle"&gt;tiny parcels involved in cell-cell communication&lt;/a&gt;, called extracellular vesicles, that made their way to the brain, reducing inflammation and boosting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques From Brains of Mice Within Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that most of the benefits observed here were in the older mice, not the mice engineered to display signs of Alzheimer's disease. There was also plenty of Alzheimer's-related brain damage, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid-beta protein&lt;/a&gt; buildup, that wasn't repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-develop-in-unique-ways-that-explain-some-mysteries-left-by-mice-models"&gt;no guarantee we'll see the same effects&lt;/a&gt; in human brains either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those limitations, the early signs of this approach are promising. If derived from a patient's own cells, engineered mononuclear phagocytes could alleviate some of the drawbacks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-blood-group-after-a-50-year-mystery"&gt;blood plasma&lt;/a&gt; transfusions and bone marrow transplants, so there's plenty of potential for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings show that short-term treatment improved cognition and brain health, making them a promising candidate to address age- and Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center neuropathologist Jeffrey Golden, who wasn't directly involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202417848"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"That's when they did the CAT scan, and that's when I got the phone call."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I still remember the phone call," Lynita continued. "He was so calm.  He said 'So, it was not an ulcer.  They just told me I have stage 4 pancreatic cancer.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three short weeks later, Mark lost a very short battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silent killer shows very few symptoms before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say maybe 2-3 weeks prior to diagnosis.  His acid reflux had gotten tremendously more aggressive," Lynita said.   "He was belching more.  He had fatigue.  Then, like a week or two prior, we noticed bloating in his stomach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had no clue it would literally be three weeks from the time he was diagnosed to the time that he passed," Lynita said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/mark-spain-beloved-abc13-anchor-and-community-figure-dies-after-battle-with-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Spain, beloved ABC13 anchor and community figure, dies after battle with cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is rare; just 1.6% of us are at risk of being diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you don’t often see symptoms early on, according to Centra oncologist Dr. Susannah Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger." class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/0x316/90/60c63b2f-9f81-4ffa-bf2b-db149c68e756-thumbnail_IMG_2085.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;Mark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think something that's really important to remember for pancreatic cancer or anything is that you really have to listen to your body," Cooper said. "I wouldn't ignore any symptoms.  Especially symptoms that persist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to symptoms like sudden weight loss, abdominal pain, clay-colored bowels or chronic diarrhea, jaundice, or yellowing of the skin or eyes, fatigue and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a family history of pancreatic cancer, genetic counseling can be a tool for early detection and treatment, according to Kelsey Newell, a genetic counselor with Centra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, genetic testing would be offered to those patients very shortly after their diagnosis so we can try to get a better understanding of any genetic mutations they carry that can help us be better informed of their treatment plan," Newell said.  "And identify targeted options for their therapy.  Also, provide that risk information to their family members."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery to remove the cancer and chemotherapy can help survival rates, but only 15-20% of cases are diagnosed at an early enough stage to be treated before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when I started in oncology, we had very little treatments for pancreatic cancer," said Dr. Cooper ."Over the last 5-10 years, we've gotten better and better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper said they've come a long way in developing innovative ways to help survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually have medications that can block those mutations and work specifically to attack your tumor," Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Kunk, an oncologist at UVA's cancer center, said cancer vaccines are also in clinical trials right now to help cure more patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having those patients undergo the same chemotherapy and then injecting a personalized cancer vaccine as well as an immune therapy medication to help rev up one’s immune system  to recognize those cancer proteins and mount a response to them and go after and kill all of them," Kunk explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer you should consider: cigarette smoking, obesity, physical inactivity and chronic pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor about potentially being screened if you are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anchor Mark Spain with his family (Credit: Mark Spain, ABC13)" class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media/e72c0a07-da0d-430a-b2ed-bb0cb87f15ff-large16x9_AnchorMarkSpain2.png?1652040520167"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;Anchor Mark Spain with his family (Credit: Mark Spain, ABC13)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynita doesn't know when Mark's cancer started--just that his symptoms presented too late in the game to offer any chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was one of the most aggressive cases they had seen in a while," Spain said.

Reporting in the journal Neurology Open Access, the team also warned that people with&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;both gum disease and cavities are at an 86 per cent greater risk of a stroke compared with those who have good dental habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/flossing-your-teeth-once-a-week-cuts-risk-of-stroke-by-one-fifth-d8lcqbb3q" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flossing your teeth once a week ‘cuts risk of stroke by one fifth’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The latest study monitored 5,986 adults in their fifties and sixties, none of whom had suffered a stroke when the investigation started, over 20 years. After accounting for variables such as age, body mass index and smoking, which all affect oral health, they found that those who visited their dentist regularly were 81 per cent less likely to have the gum disease and cavities tied to serious cardiovascular events, such as fatal heart disease and stroke, which cuts blood supply to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This study reinforces the idea that taking care of your teeth and gums isn’t just about your smile; it could help protect your brain,” said Souvik Sen, a professor of neurology and lead author of the paper. “People with signs of gum disease or cavities should seek treatment not just to preserve their teeth, but potentially to reduce stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Taking good care of your teeth could even reduce your risk of dementia. A study in Neurology found gum disease and tooth loss were tied to shrinkage in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that plays a role in memory and Alzheimer’s disease. There’s evidence, too, that the delicate bacterial balance in the mouth, known as the oral microbiome, may be implicated in memory loss and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a study of 115 midlifers published this year&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Anne Corbett, a professor of dementia research at the University of Exeter, found that certain types of bacteria in the mouth are associated with better memory, focus and attention, while others are linked to poor brain health and dementia. In future, she says, it could lead to the development of DIY tests to detect early signs that someone is at elevated risk of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/the-foods-to-eat-and-avoid-for-maintaining-healthy-teeth-mpbsw2jq8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The foods to eat and the ones to avoid for healthy teeth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The potential for profiling dementia risk through at-home sampling is exciting,” Corbett says. “It is possible that the [oral] microbiome could form part of a battery of tests that would be used for this purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oral hygiene — brushing twice a day and using floss or interdental brushes — remains the most important step, but thinking beyond that with steps that can improve our teeth and gums is increasingly considered a powerful way to protect against disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“People see their general health as separate from their oral health,” Sikka says. “They don’t see the mouth as connected to the body, yet the mouth-body connection is extremely strong.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Here’s how you can improve the health of your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Make sure you get plenty of omega-3 fats in your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="3.13"&gt;&lt;div id="30c4c9d4-a187-47cf-ba51-f1240d283fb5"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Omega-3 fats found in oily fish such as salmon have anti-inflammatory effects on the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;We are all encouraged to eat more fatty fish for general health, but many of us don’t realise that the benefits of the essential healthy omega-3 oils they contain extend to improvements in our oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Omega-3 fats found in oily fish such as salmon, sardines and mackerel have anti-inflammatory effects on the body,” Shahid says. “Some studies show that when people with gum disease take omega-3s alongside dental treatment, their gums heal a little better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One recent investigation in the journal Scientific Reports suggested that combining omega-3 supplementation with regular exercise had a potent effect on lowering inflammation and helping the immune system to fight off chronic tooth root infections. It also helped to protect teeth from bone loss. The NHS recommends we eat at least one portion of oily fish a week. “Other good sources of omega-3 fats include flaxseed and walnuts,” Shahid says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Take a daily beetroot shot and eat your leafy greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some beneficial oral bacteria are known to play a key role in turning nitrate to nitric oxide, which has been shown in numerous studies to relax and widen blood vessels and improve blood flow around the body, including to the brain. Research by Anni Vanhatalo, professor in the faculty of health and life sciences at the University of Exeter, and Corbett has shown that eating plenty of nitrate-rich foods, including beetroot, can help with that process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In ongoing studies looking at the effects on oral health of taking a daily beetroot shot for 12 weeks Vanhatalo and Corbett have found that nitrate supplementation causes changes in mouth bacteria that are associated with healthier blood vessels and brain function as we age. They have also seen that levels of many harmful species of bacteria linked to inflammation decrease when beetroot shots are consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We have shown that chronic nitrate supplementation [with beetroot shots] increases the proportion of nitrite-producing oral bacteria,” Vanhatalo says. “This change is particularly beneficial in older people because as we age, our ability to produce nitric oxide via alternative pathways decreases.” Beetroot shots are one option, but leafy greens such as spinach, rocket and other salad leaves are also good sources of dietary nitrate. “We know that a nitrate-rich diet such as the Mediterranean diet or Dash diet is an effective intervention to reduce the proportion of potentially harmful oral bacteria,” Vanhatalo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Regularly exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Staying fit has benefits for your oral health, as a recent review in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care demonstrated. Dental researchers looked at the effects of regular intense physical exercise — running, cycling, swimming and competitive sports — and found that the physically active “have lower levels of inflammatory biological markers, which is linked to better oral health”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They also revealed that regular exercise has a positive effect on salivary antigens, substances in saliva that can trigger a positive immune response, as well as improved oral muscle strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Exercise improves blood flow, lowers levels of inflammation in the body that exacerbate gum disease, and helps control conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure that can make gum problems worse,” Shahid says. “While a workout in the gym won’t clean your teeth, staying active supports the gums and tissues that keep them in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Get plenty of fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Few of us get the recommended 30g of fibre a day that the NHS says we need for good health. We tend to think of fibre as improving our gut health and digestion, but its effects are far-reaching and by increasing our intake with more wholegrains, fruit and vegetables, we may inadvertently boost the health of our teeth and gums. A review by dental experts from Australia, New Zealand and India found that people who consumed 22-30g of fibre daily had less swelling of the gums, less plaque build-up and stronger tissues surrounding the teeth. It suggests “a fibre-rich daily diet may offer promise as a complementary approach for the prevention and management of periodontal diseases”, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Crunchy foods such as celery, raw carrots and peppers promote oral health not just because of the immune enhancing antioxidants they contain, but because they physically scrub the teeth as you chew them. Think of them as nature’s own interdental brushes, Sikka says. “All high-fibre foods act a bit like a natural cleanser as they rub against your teeth when you chew,” he says. “In addition, the chewing they require stimulates saliva production, which, in conjunction with good brushing and flossing habits, helps to remove plaque from the teeth.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Eat cheese after a meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="3.33"&gt;&lt;div id="f2f1573e-c34a-417a-b1f3-38a2d47f51b0"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Cheese helps to neutralise acid levels in the mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Cheese is good news for your oral health. “It is not only rich in calcium and phosphorus, which strengthen your tooth enamel, but cheese also helps to neutralise acid levels in the mouth,” Sikka says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Consuming a small piece of cheese after eating acidic foods or drinks — ultra-processed foods and fizzy drinks — can help to raise pH levels in the mouth, reducing levels of bacteria that over a long term can lead to decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a small trial at Western Kentucky University researchers gave participants 28g of mild cheddar 60 seconds after they had sipped some cola. Tests showed that the cheese helped to “provide a protective shield around the teeth that fights the release of acids”, the researchers wrote. Cheese also increases the flow of saliva, preventing bacteria from sticking to tooth surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Consider a deep-cleaning treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Data from the latest Adult Oral Health Survey commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care suggests that in England 19 per cent of adults and up to 28 per cent of those aged 55-64 said they had been told they had gum disease. Gum disease can be treated on the NHS — national guidelines include deep cleaning under local anaesthesia as part of the programme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Marco Orlandi, honorary associate professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, recently published findings of a two-year clinical trial in the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;European Heart Journal that found that this type of deep cleaning can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 10 per cent each year compared with those who underwent a routine scale and polish. By reducing the amount of gum inflammation and bacteria entering the bloodstream, the deep cleaning helped to slow the thickening of the carotid arteries, the blood vessels supplying oxygen to the

In severe cases, it can lead to abscesses, perforation, or bowel obstruction, which could require surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for developing diverticulitis is over 50, with studies showing mean ages of around 52 to 64 for diagnosed cases. But trends could be shifting, the new study shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From looking at more &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx"&gt;than 5.2 million&lt;/a&gt; hospitalizations included in the National Inpatient Sample, the researchers found a troubling surge in severe diverticulitis cases among Americans younger than 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that the proportion of younger patients admitted with complicated diverticulitis rose from 18.5 percent to 28.2 percent, a 52 percent relative increase over the 15-year period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, roughly 16 percent of the 5.2 million patients hospitalized for diverticulitis in that timeframe were under 50, classifying them as early-onset cases. Past research suggests the Western diet, with processed foods and a high red meat consumption, could be to blame for the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Diverticulitis is the inflammation or infection of small pouches called diverticula that form in the wall of the colon. It typically causes abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the researchers in the new study noted that the reasons behind the rise in early-onset diverticulitis remain unclear, other studies have made the link to certain lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A large‑scale lifestyle and genetics study by Mass General Brigham in 2025 found that individuals with a healthier lifestyle (non‑smoking, a BMI less than 25, higher physical activity, higher fiber intake, lower red meat consumption) had substantially lower risk of diverticulitis, even if they had a high genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile several studies, particularly a large-scale twin 2012 study conducted in Sweden, have linked diverticulitis to genetics, with estimates suggesting that 40 to 53 percent of the risk is heritable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study further highlighted differences between younger and older patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset patients generally had lower mortality rates, shorter hospital stays - about a quarter of a day less on average - and lower hospital costs, roughly $1,900 less per admission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, younger patients were more likely to need invasive interventions, with 29 percent higher odds of a colectomy (a surgery to remove part or all of the colon) and 58 percent higher odds of needing the area to be drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colectomy is a surgical solution for severe, complicated, or recurrent diverticulitis, not a solution for all cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For milder cases, treatment typically involves antibiotics and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the proportion of younger patients undergoing colectomy decreased from 34.7 percent to 20.3 percent, suggesting that more cases are being managed successfully earlier on without surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author and fourth-year medical student at UCLA Shineui Kim said of this finding: 'While younger patients generally have better survival outcomes and shorter hospitalizations, they're paradoxically more likely to need invasive interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This suggests their disease may be more aggressive or that treatment approaches differ based on patient age and overall health status.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actor Josh Gad, 44, said using a GLP-1 drug for weight loss caused him to get diverticulitis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that further research is 'urgently needed' to explore exactly what is behind the boom in early-onset diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study appears in the journal Diseases in the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend, the researchers said, mirrors similar increases in colorectal cancer among younger Americans, raising public health concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An investigation by the American Cancer Society (ACS) found that after a stable 15-year trend, diagnoses of local-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) rose dramatically in adults aged 45 to 49 years old between 2019 and 2022 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among this age group, cases were increasing one percent annually from 2004 to 2019, but that increase accelerated to 12 percent per year from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people 20 to 39 years old, CRC incidence has increased steadily by 1.6 percent annually since 2004 and by two percent and 2.6 percent annually since 2012 among adults 40 to 44 and 50 to 54 years old, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, from 2021 to 2022, there was a 50 percent relative increase in diagnoses, rising from 11.7 per 100,000 people to 17.5 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This steep increase was driven by the detection of early, local-stage tumors, which increased from 2019 to 2022 by 19 percent per year for colon cancer and by 25 percent per year for rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Monica - who does not give her last name - found it difficult to get doctors to listen to her health concerns. The Australian, who is currently living in Croatia, was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last year when she was 31 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study's lead author Elizabeth Schafer attributed the rise in colon cancer diagnoses to new recommendations that lowered the screening age for the disease. A second ACS report found CRC screening among US adults 45 to 49 years of age increased by 62 percent from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended age to begin CRC screening was lowered from 50 to 45 by the ACS in 2018 and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) followed suit in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are expected to die from colorectal cancer this year, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It involves waking up in the morning and jumping 50 times—that’s it. People swear it does everything from reduce bloat and fatigue to lower your blood pressure, and some say it even makes them feel more joyful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept seems to have started with Kathryn Smith, who is a trainer who helps with surgeries. “I’m a lazy person by nature,” she said in a July &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@kathhrynsmithh/video/7529493716998884622" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/@kathhrynsmithh/video/7529493716998884622"}' href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kathhrynsmithh/video/7529493716998884622" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, noting that it’s taken “baby steps” for her to be more active. One way she did it? By what she calls “morning jumping.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I get out of bed, my feet touch the ground, I jump 50 times,” she said. “What does your brain require first thing in the morning? Oxygen. How do you increase oxygen to your brain? Blood flow. How do you increase your blood flow? Increase your heart rate. Jump up and down.” She also noted that this can be good for lymphatic drainage and bone density. “If you have the ability to jump, you should do it every day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, plenty of other people have shared videos of themselves jumping up and down, and they seem pretty happy about it. TikTok poster &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@tvroomie/video/7566281556482952455" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/@tvroomie/video/7566281556482952455"}' href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tvroomie/video/7566281556482952455" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;@tvroomie&lt;/a&gt; has been doing this for weeks, and calls the act “life-changing.” She shared in a later &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@tvroomie/video/7562971398445059335" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/@tvroomie/video/7562971398445059335"}' href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tvroomie/video/7562971398445059335" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that jumping up and down each day “brings me joy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow poster &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@chisaspam_/video/7562583094352481550?" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.tiktok.com/@chisaspam_/video/7562583094352481550?"}' href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chisaspam_/video/7562583094352481550?" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;@chisaspam_&lt;/a&gt; has been sharing updates on her journey with jumping daily, noting that she’s “actually starting to see a difference in my body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some big claims for something that seems easy to pull off. But doctors and a fitness trainer say morning jumping is a fitness hack worth trying. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How jumping can impact your health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s suddenly popular, jumping up and down isn’t a new thing, per se. “This is essentially glorified jump roping,” &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-eric-michael-ascher-do-1255718748" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-eric-michael-ascher-do-1255718748"}' href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-eric-michael-ascher-do-1255718748" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Ascher, DO&lt;/a&gt;, family medicine physician at Northwell’s Lenox Hill Hospital, tells SELF. “But we know that jumping and jumping rope are wonderful means of managing blood pressure, fatigue, and bloating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumping can raise your heart rate, along with elevate your body temperature and increase blood flow and fluid movement in the body, &lt;a href="https://kines.rutgers.edu/faculty/faculty/faculty-profile/317-full-time-faculty/1122-malin-steven-k" target="_blank"&gt;Steven K. Malin, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, tells SELF. “The higher body temperature helps along with increased blood and fluid movement to loosen joints, tendons, and muscles for flexibility,” he says. Moving your body can also help with getting your lymphatic system moving, which can help remove waste from your body, Dr. Ascher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SELF Magazine</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:50:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTFBtaFpEbEI4UWIzNThDS0o2cmU0R20tWFVTWFJhQTlNMENIWFloWWpBV1lfNE0wMkVSMnpwd19hWWxJU2Z0VlZfSnhrVTdrajZ0bmFILVF2NXUtYzZDQU92Z2hzY2M1QQ</guid></item><item><title>这种“永恒”的饮食模式可以帮助降低血压，即使是高风险人群-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/this-timeless-eating-pattern-can-help-lower-blood-pressure-even-in-high-risk-individuals/photostory/125063250.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean diet isn’t a strict meal plan but rather a style of eating inspired by the traditional cuisines of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, such as Greece, Italy, and Spain. It emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt;This diet is essentially characterized by high consumption of plant‐based foods. The study suggested that eating more minimally processed plant-based proteins may lower the risk for high blood pressure. One of the senior authors of the study Dr. Marcia Otto said, “Our study focused on foods, not the plant-based supplements that can be found on store shelves”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another important finding was that minimally processed animal proteins could be included in weekly meal plans without significantly affecting a person's high blood pressure risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>每年有170万美国老年人死于这种疾病。如何在十大死因中幸存下来？ - Money Talks新闻</title><link>https://www.moneytalksnews.com/million-older-americans-die-like-this-every-year-what-can-you-do-to-survive-the-top-causes-of-death/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 21:20:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiywFBVV95cUxOX21pcmczS1RIaV9xZFFYOHpBS003YU9fZjJDODlkTUZvbUJoSjZHQk1RYnk0YUtCMHFSbWxyeWFxT1ZZczN4TXNYOXA1elpnQkttUkw2M2tkb0pvYUJ6SlRBU1d0U1cwZ3pOMUdFLThGWWpHVEdwVVpjcEc2VDBOZ29JSXZXcTBVLUF1STFZSWpkbTNpQzVtVk9Mc3hOMVpCaVYxaUxoNy1Bc09UbE5idllrdE9iWjJLeGxjcmlqYnRVUEppTDdWUmtPUQ</guid></item><item><title>美国热点地区发现更多麻疹病例- CIDRAP</title><link>https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/us-hot-spots-see-more-measles-cases</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend Utah and South Carolina, the current hot spots of measles activity in the United States, saw case counts climb, and Idaho reported a new case in a young child.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In global measles news, &lt;em&gt;The Jerusalem Post &lt;/em&gt;is reporting that two vaccinated adult doctors have contacted measles from a young, unvaccinated patient.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 more cases in Utah &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Utah the statewide total has increased by 4 infections and is &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;now 64&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sixty-one of the state's measles case-patients are unvaccinated, and 49 of the 64 cases, and all 4 new cases, are from the Southwest Utah health department, which includes Washington County. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington County is home to Hildale, a town that neighbors Colorado City, Arizona. Together those two communities are seeing an uptick in measles activity among largely insular and unvaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Utah-Arizona outbreak is the second largest outbreak of the year so far, following the West Texas outbreak this past spring and summer that sickened at least &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;&lt;u&gt;762 people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

There are now at least seven measles cases in the state. Officials told news media that the child, who lives in Boundary County, had recently traveled outside the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-872364"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Finally today in Israel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, two vaccinated doctors in Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital have contracted measles after treating an unvaccinated child. Both doctors report mild symptoms and will remain in isolation for the duration of the infectious period of the disease.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of October, Israel has seen 1,700 confirmed cases of measles, and 8 children have died from the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This guy’s very first troponin was 21.00. TWENTY-ONE. The highest we’ve ever had up till then was an 8.00. The guy should’ve been dead ages ago, but he somehow pulled through.

        &lt;p&gt;SARS-CoV-2, the cause of covid-19, isn’t the only coronavirus in the world we should be keeping our eye on. Scientists appear to have just discovered a new branch of coronaviruses in Brazilian bats that could have the tools needed to spill over and infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large team of researchers in Japan and Brazil identified the possible zoonotic threat in a preliminary study released last week. The viral relative appears to be genetically distinct from other coronaviruses yet shares a feature with SARS-CoV-2 that may allow its kind to infect human cells. The findings suggest there are plenty of native bat coronaviruses in the wild with the potential to cause new epidemics in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The high diversity of viruses in bats therefore positions them as a key taxonomic group for zoonotic disease surveillance,” the authors &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.10.24.684489v1"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, presented as a preprint on the website bioRxiv.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A key similarity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even prior to the emergence of covid-19 more than five years ago, scientists had been worried about &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/were-not-ready-for-the-next-pandemic-1839169413"&gt;coronaviruses&lt;/a&gt; causing the next big pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, its earlier ancestor SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV are coronaviruses that successfully became human pathogens over the past two decades; all three belong to the betacoronavirus genus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the study researchers, however, almost everything we know about the diversity of this genus is based on data collected from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, with little genetic sequencing of such viruses in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To help remedy this gap in knowledge, the team analyzed gut tissue samples collected from 70 bats in three sites across Brazil between May and August 2019. They found the new virus in a Parnell’s mustached bat (&lt;em&gt;Pteronotus parnellii&lt;/em&gt;) and completely sequenced its genome.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Based on their analysis, the virus—which they coined BRZ batCoV—is different enough genetically to represent a previously unknown subgenus of betacoronavirus. Until now, five subgenera had been identified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the virus also appears to have something important in common with SARS-CoV-2: a functional furin cleavage site (FCS) at the S1/S2 junction of its spike protein. In fact, the FCS in BRZ batCoV is only different by a single amino acid compared to the one in SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;How worried should we be?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FCS in SARS-CoV-2 is one of the features that helps it to infect humans. So finding something very similar in this new virus is certainly troubling. The researchers also note that other bat betacoronaviruses are known to have an FCS in the same location, suggesting it’s relatively easy for this feature to pop up in these viruses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another concerning aspect is that since there’s so little surveillance of Brazil and other areas in the Americas, it’s more than possible that BRZ batCoV and similar viruses have been circulating under our noses for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The new research hasn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, a vital part of vetting any new study. The researchers also point out that they haven’t directly examined the infectivity of BRZ batCoV, a caveat that limits how much we can know about its risk to humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hence, although the presence of an FCS is clearly significant, any discussion of the zoonotic potential of this virus should be limited,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, this sort of research should be seen as an early warning signal. While the origins of SARS-CoV-2 are still being debated—even if &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/virologists-and-epidemiologists-back-natural-origin-covid-19-survey-suggests"&gt;most virologists&lt;/a&gt; are in the natural camp—many human diseases do first start off as zoonotic germs that successfully jump from animals to people (case in point, the&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1472041/#:~:text=Additional%20SARS%20cases%20resulted%20from,virus%20to%20humans%20(60)."&gt; original SARS&lt;/a&gt;). Bats and the viruses they carry are a prime suspect for causing the next big pandemic, and it’s urgent that we better track what’s out there, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Our study provides a broader understanding of the phylogenetic and functional diversity of bat coronaviruses as well as their zoonotic potential,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing the risk of a life-altering neurodegenerative disease by almost half sounds like it should require some sort of miraculous medicinal intervention, but an increasing number of scientific studies suggest it could be as simple as listening to music. In October 2025, the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.70163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published a study that found an incredibly strong association between mental health in old age and one’s connection to music. The study observed participants who both listened to music and played an instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
            
        
            &lt;p id="sv-video-container"&gt;
              
            &lt;/p&gt;
        
                
            



&lt;p&gt;Scientists discovered a 39% reduction in &lt;a href="https://americansongwriter.com/the-surprising-scientific-link-between-dementia-and-hit-songs-by-elvis-presley-abba-and-spice-girls/"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; in individuals who reported they “always” listened to music as opposed to “never,” “rarely,” or “sometimes.” Those who documented themselves as “often” or “always” playing a musical instrument saw a 35% reduction in dementia risk. Individuals who did both showed a 33% reduction. Listening to and playing music also helped reduce the risk of non-dementia cognitive decline. Interestingly, the study found stronger correlations between decreased dementia risk and music in individuals with over 16 years of education, as opposed to those with 15 years or less.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a study published three months earlier, a different group of researchers found that the brains of older individuals who regularly played an instrument responded to stimuli in a manner that more closely resembled that of younger brains. Their non-musical counterparts, on the other hand, showed greater cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Just like a well-tuned instrument doesn’t need to be played louder to be heard, the brains of older musicians stay finely tuned thanks to years of training,” the study’s co-author, Dr. Yi Du, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/brain-musical-instrument" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told BBC Science Focus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-music-with-this-added-might-reduce-dementia-risk-even-more"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music With This Added Might Reduce Dementia Risk Even More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Listening to music of any kind can help reduce the risk of dementia in older individuals. But multiple studies suggest that listening to a specific frequency in tandem with one’s favorite music could be even more effective in minimizing the potential for cognitive decline. Researchers have long touted the benefits of 40 Hz stimulation with both light and sound can reduce Alzheimer’s disease pathology and symptoms in both mice and humans. In 2024, scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197457224000223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins School of Nursing&lt;/a&gt; found that combining participants’ favorite music with a 40 Hz stimulus further reduces the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Johns Hopkins researchers asked the study participants to listen to their “40 Hz music” for a minimum of one hour per day, preferably three hours before bed. By combining individuals’ favorite music with 40 Hz therapy, participants were more receptive to the treatment, which appears to minimize or reduce dementia-like symptoms. According to the study, this can “improve usability and practical enjoyment” of this specific type of therapy. (Because if a therapy is so unpleasant that no one wants to use it, then what’s the point?)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things we can do to maintain our health as we age, and not all of them are always pleasant. And while we’re by no means undermining the importance of eating specific foods, avoiding others, abstaining from alcohol or other drugs, and regularly exercising, listening to music seems to have just as many benefits for our mental health and is arguably way more enjoyable than some of those aforementioned risk-reduction activities. Happy listening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spending too much time being sedentary is the number one habit to break to burn visceral fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Smart exercise strategies such as starting small, setting a timer and variety can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrition, sleep and stress management are all helpful in reducing visceral fat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Plank Challenge may be all over social media. But there’s another reason to burn off belly fat that has nothing to do with sculpting killer abs. Belly fat, technically known as visceral fat, can spell bad news for your health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve never heard of visceral fat before, this type of fat burrows deep into your abdomen, where it surrounds organs like the liver and intestines. That doesn’t just make your belly rounder. Visceral fat also cranks out inflammatory proteins that increase the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and some cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, your lifestyle habits can have a big impact on the amount of visceral fat you carry. If you’d like to trim belly fat and improve your health in the process, read on to learn the No. 1 habit to break to reduce visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-being-too-sedentary-is-the-biggest-habit-to-break"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Being Too Sedentary is the Biggest Habit to Break &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re sitting down reading this, then stand up immediately. Then get ready for this … being too sedentary is the No. 1 habit you need to break ASAP to reduce visceral fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why? Most of us are not nearly active enough (and spend way too much time sitting!).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While physical activity guidelines recommend engaging in at least 150 minutes of activity per week, less than half of us actually meet these recommendations.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yet, research reveals that increasing physical activity may be one of the best ways to stop the progression of diseases triggered by excess body fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “By increasing movement, you can build lean body mass, which helps to increase overall resting metabolism, promoting more favorable body composition,” says &lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “Movement also enhances fat metabolism and regulates insulin levels, helping the body burn stored fat more effectively.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-exercise-strategies-on-how-to-reduce-it"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Exercise Strategies On How to Reduce It &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Burning visceral fat may require some strategies. Here are some expert tips on how to do it:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start Small: &lt;/strong&gt;Visceral fat may be stubborn, but you don’t have to run a marathon to get rid of it. “If you're new to regular movement, start with just 10 to 15 minutes of an activity you enjoy, like a walk around your neighborhood, dancing or yoga,” says &lt;a href="https://www.patriciabannan.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Patricia Bannan, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Fit in movement throughout the day in small ways, such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking farther away, or taking the long way to the coffee machine at work to add more steps to your day,” adds Palinski-Wade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buddy Up:&lt;/strong&gt; The best way to make it a habit is to repeat it daily until it’s as normal as brushing your teeth. Bannan recommends teaming up with a friend to make your movement habit stick. “Celebrating small wins, like reaching a daily step goal, can build momentum and make it easier to stay active in the long term,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a Timer: &lt;/strong&gt;“Every 30 to 60 minutes, set a reminder to stand up, stretch or walk around for a couple of minutes,” says Bannan. “This breaks up long periods of sitting and helps stimulate circulation and muscle activity.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pace Around the House:&lt;/strong&gt; Palinski-Wade recommends walking while talking on the phone instead of sitting. “This way you are using time you already have to fit more movement into your busy day,” she adds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pump Some Iron: &lt;/strong&gt;“Strength training is one of the best things you can do to offset visceral fat,” says Palinski-Wade. “Aim to add strength training one to two times per week, focusing on major muscle groups to improve strength and lean body mass.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix Up Your Workouts: &lt;/strong&gt;Strength training isn’t the only way to burn visceral fat. Research has found that three aerobic or interval workouts per week are also effective for reducing belly fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-reducing-visceral-fat"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Other Tips for Reducing Visceral Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, moving is key, but there are even more steps you can take to lose visceral fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Log Those Zzz’s. &lt;/strong&gt;“Just one poor night of sleep can increase appetite and insulin resistance, making you more likely to eat excess calories and triggering your body to store more visceral fat versus burning it,” says Palinski-Wade. In addition to practicing good sleep hygiene, these&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291992/6-sleep-habits-that-can-help-you-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; healthy sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; can also help with weight management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chill Out.&lt;/strong&gt; “Mindfulness activities, such as &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mindful eating &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stress-reducing practices&lt;/a&gt;, like meditation or deep breathing, can help lower cortisol levels, a hormone linked to visceral fat accumulation,” says Bannan. “Managing stress through mindfulness can be an effective way to support your body’s ability to burn fat, particularly in the abdominal area.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlist Fiber. &lt;/strong&gt;“Adding more fiber to your diet can help to balance blood sugar, which in turn can lessen insulin resistance that stores visceral fat,” says Palinski-Wade. “In addition, dietary fiber helps to curb appetite and may promote weight loss, further lowering visceral fat levels.” Plus, high-fiber foods are often rich in antioxidants, which may offset inflammation and reduce stress hormones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Skimp on Fat.&lt;/strong&gt; It may sound counterintuitive, but in order to lose visceral fat, you have to eat healthy fats. “&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fish-to-eat-for-weight-loss-8670654" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/a&gt; is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve fat metabolism,” says Bannan. “Including salmon or other fatty fish, like mackerel, sardines, herring or trout in your diet a couple of times a week can support your efforts to reduce visceral fat while also promoting heart and brain health.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no magic pill to reduce visceral body fat. However, nutrition experts agree that simply moving more can improve your body composition and reduce visceral body fat. And you don’t have to log hours in the gym to see results. While strength training and aerobic activity are excellent ways to burn belly fat, going for regular walks with a friend or scheduling movement breaks into your workday are great ways to incorporate more activity into your day. The goal is to rack up those 150 minutes of physical activity each week. And if you still want to do the Plank Challenge, well, that’s great too!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Several lots of a prescription ADHD medication have been recalled due to "failed dissolution specifications," the Food and Drug Administration announced last week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries of New Jersey recalled certain bottles of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules, a generic version of Vyvanse that was sold nationwide. The recall was initiated on Oct. 28 and given a Class II risk level by the FDA on Oct. 30.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Class II classification indicates that the recalled medication “may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences,” but the risk of serious health consequences is low.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries recalled the medication due to “failed dissolution specifications,” meaning the drug did not dissolve as expected in laboratory settings, which could make it less effective.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The manufacturer did not issue a press release about this recall, so there are no specific instructions for medication users.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it's not recommended to stop ADHD medication abruptly, as it could cause withdrawal symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Check your medications at home, and if you have any bottles affected by the recall, don’t take them. Instead, contact your healthcare provider or pharmacy for guidance on obtaining a replacement bottle or refund.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p class="custom-html embed-container mv-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle isn’t the only city that’s faced difficult neighborhood conversations when deciding where to locate services aimed at helping people in mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan King County Council &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/mental-health/king-county-council-approves-plans-funding-for-capitol-hill-crisis-center/" class="content-link"&gt;voted last month to place a walk-in mental health crisis center on Capitol Hill&lt;/a&gt; — a location that sparked discussions in the surrounding neighborhood and heated public comments at council meetings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporters of the center say the facility is needed in the neighborhood, which struggles with disorder tied to homelessness, drug use and mental health. But some local residents, business owners and real estate owners voiced concern about how the center might affect public safety in the surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://dchsblog.com/2025/10/01/listening-to-local-voices-community-engagement-for-the-seattle-crisis-care-center-location/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;King County says it has held nearly 60&lt;/a&gt; community conversations, presentations, walking tours and other events focused on the Capitol Hill location, some in the neighborhood say the county hasn’t sufficiently engaged with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. cities have also navigated community relationships and dealt with pushback as they seek to build centers adjacent to residential areas and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can Seattle learn from other cities’ experience? Similar centers in Denver and Milwaukee can provide lessons on managing relationships and operating a center successfully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-19008117-1353473057" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":19008117,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=300x226 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1024x772 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=768x579 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1536x1158 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=2048x1544 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=780x588 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1020x769 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=1560x1176 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=2040x1538 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=375x283 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/10312025_crisis_135407.jpg?d=780x588","caption":"King County plans to site a new mental health crisis center on Capitol Hill, at a former Polyclinic building located at 1145 Broadway.

Almost half of residents are below the poverty line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Valley has a lot of publicly subsidized affordable housing, and a lot of families, said Jeanne Granville, president of the Sun Valley Community Coalition. Census data shows that more than half the population is under the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city’s vision for the center had a lot in common with &lt;a href="https://www.desc.org/what-we-do/crisis-response/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;DESC’s Crisis Solutions Center&lt;/a&gt; in Seattle — it would accept people via referrals from law enforcement and other first responders. People could access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city contracted with WellPower, a large mental health provider in Colorado, to operate the center. WellPower also partners with the Denver Police Department to send mental health professionals to calls alongside police. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were not necessarily the program that the neighborhood wanted,” said Ellen Todd, WellPower’s associate director for crisis services. “They wanted a youth program coming in, and this was not it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gallery-19008046-2031076544" class="st-image-gallery standard-embed mb-4" data-gallery='{"layout":"standard-embed","images":[{"id":19008046,"sizes":"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1019px) calc(100vw - 335px), 630px","srcset":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=300x200 300w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1024x683 1024w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=768x512 768w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1536x1024 1536w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=2048x1365 2048w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=780x520 780w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1020x680 1020w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=1560x1040 1560w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=2040x1360 2040w, https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=375x250 375w","src":"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10312025_crisis_133750.jpg?d=780x520","caption":"Inside the Behavioral Health Solutions Center in Denver, patients can access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit. (Brad Nicol / WellPower)","aspectRatio":1.5,"alt":"Inside the Behavioral Health Solutions Center in Denver, patients can access services including behavioral health assessment, counseling and inpatient treatment during short-term stays in the crisis stabilization unit.

They didn’t really understand how the center would be structured or what it would do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a better understanding of who it was going to be, how it was going to serve folks, how it was going to operate was really important,” Granville said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the center opened, the community coalition and the provider worked with a mediator from the city to draft a &lt;a href="https://www.denvergov.org/files/assets/public/v/1/public-health-and-environment/documents/cbh/solutioncenter_goodneighboragreement.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Good Neighbor Agreement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It outlined requirements WellPower (formerly named the Mental Health Center of Denver) and the city of Denver must follow, including 24/7 security staffing, the creation of a neighborhood advisory committee, and regular reporting on the center’s use. It also banned the center from admitting registered sex offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King County will require every center’s operator to create a good neighbor agreement with the surrounding community. For Capitol Hill, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell &lt;a href="https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/08/COS-CCC-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;has also asked the county&lt;/a&gt; to partner with Seattle police on a security assessment and plan for ongoing safe operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The good neighbor agreements are really a useful tool to sit down and walk through those concerns and be proactive,” Granville said. “If there are things that come up, how will they be addressed quickly?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wellpower.org/behavioral-health-solutions-center/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;The Behavioral Health Solutions Center opened in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and has had “very little effect” on the neighborhood, Granville said. Initially, WellPower held monthly meetings the neighborhood could attend; now they’re just quarterly “because things have been going so well,” Todd said. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;There’s a key difference from the center planned in Capitol Hill: Patients can’t walk in on their own. WellPower operates a walk-in crisis center in another part of the city, which served about 2,300 people in 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granville thinks a walk-in center would have been a “very different situation” that the Sun Valley community wouldn’t have been receptive to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the solutions center served 777 people. WellPower creates a discharge plan for every patient and offers Lyft rides or bus tickets to the next location they’re going to, Todd said. If they need shelter, they can stay in adjacent temporary housing for up to 30 days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient transportation and discharge planning have also been questions in King County. The county has said money is designated for postdischarge stabilization, which will include staff to take patients to follow-up appointments and transportation to get them to their home, a shelter or another treatment facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granville said the Sun Valley neighborhood’s safety concerns haven’t come to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We already know that there are people who are experiencing behavioral health and substance use crises in your neighborhood,” Todd said. “We are here to help them and to provide those services. Without us, people are walking around and they’re still experiencing a behavioral health or substance use crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Credible messengers&lt;/strong&gt;“&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A unique requirement of Wisconsin’s involuntary treatment system led to a new emergency mental health center in Milwaukee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin has a law that applies to large counties: People brought in on an involuntary mental health hold (which in Wisconsin, can only be initiated by police) must be assessed by a physician within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means a mental health-specific emergency center plays a key role in streamlining the system, said Michael Lappen, Milwaukee County’s behavioral health administrator. It allows law enforcement to bring patients to a facility that’s specifically designed to evaluate and treat them, without putting that burden on generalized hospital emergency rooms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milwaukee County had for decades run a crisis emergency department as part of a larger mental health complex in Wauwatosa, a suburb west of the city. In 2018, it decided to outsource inpatient psychiatric care to Universal Health Services — but the private company declined to take responsibility for the emergency department, &lt;a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/solutions/2019/08/16/milwaukee-county-could-lose-its-psychiatric-crisis-center/1819222001/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the old mental health complex moved toward closure, the county had to figure out how to open a designated emergency center — “the thing that makes the system work here,” Lappen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parcel was available next to the county’s human services building in the King Park neighborhood. The neighborhood is mostly residential and has some low income housing; it’s close to downtown, but separated by Interstate 43. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available property was also in the center of the need for mental health care. Data showed that 70% of people admitted to the county’s mental health crisis center were from the 53205 ZIP code (where the property is located) or one of nine adjacent ZIP codes, Lappen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Lanier, a pastor in Milwaukee, was part of the county’s Mental Health Board and had previously launched a &lt;a href="https://wjlanier.com/miracle-mental-health-2/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;mental health ministry&lt;/a&gt; working to decrease stigma in the city’s Black community. He helped the county spread the word about the center with the community through listening sessions and outreach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It increased their credibility and relationship with the community because we were credible messengers,” Lanier said. “That strong relationship with our network bore a lot of relational fruit. It’s extra significant in a city like Milwaukee that’s known for being highly segregated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Lappen and Lanier said there wasn’t much pushback from the neighborhood community where the center was planned. Lanier appreciated the county’s intentionality in engaging during the planning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes that community engagement is thought of as an afterthought or an appendage to a process that’s already foregone,” Lanier said. “Because of our relationships and advocacy, that allowed for a richer process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://mentalhealthmke.org/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Mental Health Emergency Center&lt;/a&gt; opened in September 2022 and has averaged about 8,000 visits per year. Adults and youth can access medication and short-term care to help them stabilize; the average adult stay is seven hours, Lappen said. If patients need more intensive treatment, the center will help transfer them to inpatient care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of patients come in voluntarily and half are brought in on involuntary treatment holds. The county pays half of the operating costs and the rest is split among local hospital systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being adjacent to downtown is helpful, Lappen said, because people are able to access other services to get meals or shelters. There’s a large hospital two blocks away, where patients can be transferred if they need more intensive medical care. It’s also much faster for law enforcement and other first responders to bring patients in for evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We went from being where nobody was to where 70% of the patients actually live,” Lappen said. “That’s why it’s working out so well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They haven’t seen increased crime or negative outcomes around the center, Lappen said. The effects have actually been positive: Fewer people living outside in the neighborhood, fewer people in crisis, less crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, Lanier said, the community has said the facility should be bigger so it could serve more people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For us, this is the bridge to get to service, and it makes the community better and healthier,” Lappen said. “If your community embraces that getting help actually shouldn’t be stigmatized, it should be celebrated, then you’ll see a culture where that’s accepted.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was, as my sports medicine doctor counseled, “time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Since I was a teen, it had been my primary form of exercise and stress relief. But for months, I had been ignoring small signs of encroaching decrepitude: the popping and grinding in my right knee and hip joints whenever I stood up, bent down or took the stairs. The medical term for this is crepitus, yet I kept stubbornly persuading myself that I was still a “young” fiftysomething.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I had imbibed the common positive ageing message: “50 is the new 30.” Yet as far as the cells that make up my knee and hip tendons and cartilage are concerned, 50 is still very much 50. So much for the popular idea that our overall “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/well/live/biological-age-testing.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt;” can be far younger than our chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For decades, I had done everything experts recommend – eat well, sleep well, exercise – and yet my doctor was still telling me it was time to adapt to my changing body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;My physiatrist told me that many of his gen X patients, now in their late 40s and 50s, have bought into the idea that age shouldn’t be a factor when it comes to what exercise they do or how they do it. Each trendy sport or exercise sends a new wave of us into his office and others like it. For instance, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31796221/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 2020 study&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly 91% of people showing up to the emergency room with injuries related to playing pickleball were over 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many people approach their physical fitness as if they were a decade or two younger. My GP told me that patients over 50 are often frustrated by any suggestion that their routines might have to change. I started to see this denial of physical realities everywhere. One of my colleagues injured her shoulder doing CrossFit, then re-injured herself a few months later doing the same routine. A friend who has practiced yoga for decades fractured her chin in a fall from crow pose. When I suggested she modify her routine, she scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2df18a7b-fa8b-4fdd-b834-51d3c9492827" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How do I stay healthy in my 50s, 60s and 70s?","elementId":"2df18a7b-fa8b-4fdd-b834-51d3c9492827","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jul/23/how-stay-healthy-50s-60s-70s-ageing-tips-advice"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a medical anthropologist, I wondered: had anti-ageing messaging accidentally created a new problem? Was our generation at risk not from under-exercising, like the boomer and silent generations before us, but from over-exercising?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-our-bodies-change-as-we-age" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How our bodies change as we age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Emily Finkelstein, a geriatrician at Weill Cornell Medicine, loves that people in their 40s, 50s and 60s have internalized that exercise is important for healthy ageing and longevity. That being said, there are some practical considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Our muscle mass and our performance peak in our mid-30s,” Finkelstein said, “and start to naturally decline after that. We do need to be flexible in terms of what we’re doing and expecting of ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As we edge past 45, we begin to lose critical muscle mass, which can decrease our strength and balance. Decreases in bone density can leave us more vulnerable to stress fractures from repetitive motions and stress. The cartilage in our joints thin, while tendons and ligaments stiffen. All of this means we’re more prone to injuries during physical activity. Recovery takes longer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The thing that people don’t know and don’t learn,” Dr Rosanne Leipzig said, “is that ageing begins at birth, and your abilities are definitely going to change.” Leipzig knows quite a lot about this process, both as a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and as someone in her 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You reach a maximum for your muscle mass, bone strength, ability to remember a list of words, all in your 30s. And everything starts to decline after that,” she said. “Ageing doesn’t mean that you can’t do what you did previously, but you probably can’t do as much in the same time period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Most experts agreed that messages like “50 is the new 30” can be helpful if they convince people not to write themselves off as they age. It’s OK to push ourselves a bit physically. But the flip side is an assumption that a 50-year-old body isn’t different from a 30-year-old body. It is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“One of the best things we can do for our own healthy ageing is to be flexible and adaptable,” Finkelstein said. “We need to change our expectations and we need to change how we exercise as we get older.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-adapt-to-ageing-bodies-and-avoid-injury" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to adapt to ag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ing bodies and avoid injury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In midlife, we should all learn to be more in tune with our bodies. That might mean taking more recovery time between intense workouts, doing more stretching and integrating more weights into our fitness routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A healthy adaptive approach to exercising as we age might involve regular self-monitoring and assessment of how our bodies feel both during and after workouts, and seeking input from a qualified medical professional when we start to notice any signs or symptoms of an encroaching problem, such as pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Leipzig suggests that physicians begin conversations about adjustments by asking patients what it is they love about an activity they’re holding on to. A tennis player might really love the social aspect. In that case, they could switch to pickleball – which is less taxing, but similar – with a complementary strength-training and stretching regimen to prevent injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But since risk of injury naturally rises as we age, it’s also important to have a backup plan for if and when we overdo it. When I talked to Dr Melissa Leber, associate professor of orthopedics and emergency medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine, she had just finished working at the US Open. Leber has a lot of experience dealing with athletes – both professional and amateur – who have pushed themselves a bit too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Some people are really good at adjusting and they’re comfortable with their bodies changing,” Leber said. “Others go hardcore. I’ve seen some patients who don’t even want a day off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

So, if you’re a runner with an injury, try a modified strength-training routine and a lower-impact activity, like swimming. Then, when you start running again, run fewer times a week or for shorter distances. To avoid injury or overuse, experts recommend one or two rest days a week, at minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Strength training is also very important. “The stronger you are,” Leber said, “the more you will avoid injury and falls. And when you do fall, you will fall differently. Your balance will be better, and you’ll recover from injury faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As a rule, Leber advises that someone in their 50s should spend 50% of their total exercise time on strength training and 50% doing cardio. By age 60, that metric should be 60% strength and 40% cardio. By 70, cardio should only comprise 30% of a workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All of the experts I spoke to agree that pain should never be ignored – and it’s never a good idea to push through the pain without seeing your doctor. That being said, Finkelstein pointed out that most general physicians aren’t all that well-trained in exercise physiology. For specific recommendations pertaining to exercise regimens, it’s better to see a physiatrist, specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation or certified physical trainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I wish we were all better trained in that,” Finkelstein said, “because it’s so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ ","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"3b504e44-3a8d-480c-b083-5ebef6a11c4c","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="3b504e44-3a8d-480c-b083-5ebef6a11c4c" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ " data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99%C2%A0" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;To compound this, conversations about how to maintain muscle mass, bone health, aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness take more time than the average physician can spend with their patients. Many people fill that gap with advice from fitness influencers online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cultivating-realistic-expectations-of-ageing" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultivating realistic expectations of ag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Finkelstein worries about the effect of the media – especially social media, with its legions of wellness and anti-ageing influencers. “Take these supplements, do this exercise program, join this fitness routine: you name it, people are serving it up,” she said. “I worry a lot about that in terms of the reliability of those people and the science behind what they’re offering, and people being vulnerable to that because you want to do what you can to stay healthy and youthful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Popular media also loves to feature “superagers” – people whose mental and/or physical abilities are comparable to people 20-30 years younger. And while it’s good to see, say, an 87-year-old running a marathon, it may lead to false expectations about normal ageing. Superagers are rare; only about 10% of the general population fit all the criteria for inclusion in the category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-gu-name="pullquote" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting … that things are going to change&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In other words, it’s not very realistic for those of us in our middle age or older to think we’ll rack up those personal bests forever. As the experts kept pointing out, the best approach to exercising as we age is realistic and adaptive. A runner who adapts to the changes of their ageing body and trains effectively may still be able to run the Boston marathon, but the time it takes for them to cross the finish line will necessarily lengthen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Part of the problem might be optimism bias. While we may logically understand that bodies change, we don’t think we are actually changing. Maybe that’s because we’re living in a culture that is obsessed not only with longevity, but with looking younger. The number of cosmetic procedures has &lt;a href="https://americanmedspa.org/news/isaps-releases-2024-global-survey-results-ranks-surgical-and-nonsurgical-procedure-popularity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increased 42.5% globally&lt;/a&gt; over the last four years, and Americans spent an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/cosmetic-surgery-market" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$20bn on cosmetic surgery&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In our society, we have a huge problem with accepting the fact that things are going to change,” Leipzig said. “People are in better shape in general than they ever have been, if they’re privileged enough to be able to take care of their needs, but it leads them to think they will never die. It leads to ageism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;And that’s the rub: being overly concerned with how much “younger” you are for your age is just another form of bias – one that you can hold against your future self. “Fifty is the new 30” simply underscores our misconception that being healthy means not ageing at all. It would be healthier if we occasionally reminded ourselves that ageing is a privilege; that “50 is 50” and “80 is 80” – and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 17:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOQWVTNzBBM215N2tUUUxmN2FKcDRKbXdDSzBibHZDU25QUnlacmRIMFlyN2hsMXVYMWM0SlphX09qNjhuS1BFSTQyRjc0ZGRMbGdEZFFJdlJYT0NJbnZyUlprQUZRZWFrSmw3Q3JmY2xhYlFxbEc0cVpoX2MyYmMzNEx5ZVB0cEhjUjZLTEpDRQ</guid></item><item><title>VEXAS综合征炎症和髓样偏倚的独立机制-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09815-0</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Abs1-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somatically acquired mutations in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were recently identified as the cause of the adult-onset autoinflammatory syndrome VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X linked, autoinflammatory, somatic)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations in VEXAS lead to clonal expansion within the HSPC and myeloid, but not lymphoid, compartments. Despite its severity and prevalence, the mechanisms whereby &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations cause multiorgan autoinflammation and hematologic disease are unknown. Here, we employ somatic gene editing approaches to model VEXAS-associated &lt;i&gt;UBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations in primary macrophages and HSPCs. &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt;-mutant macrophages exposed to inflammatory stimuli underwent aberrant apoptotic and necroptotic cell death mediated by Caspase-8 and RIPK3-MLKL, respectively. Accordingly, in mice challenged with TNF or LPS, the UBA1 inhibitor TAK-243 exacerbated inflammation in a RIPK3-Caspase-8-dependent manner. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt; mutation in HSPCs induced an unfolded protein response and myeloid bias independently of RIPK3-Caspase-8. Mechanistically, aberrant cell death of &lt;i&gt;Uba1&lt;/i&gt;-mutant macrophages coincided with a kinetic defect in Lys63/Met1 (i.e., linear) polyubiquitylation of inflammatory signaling complexes. Collectively, our results link VEXAS pathogenesis with that of rarer monogenic autoinflammatory syndromes; highlight specific ubiquitin-associated defects stemming from an apical mutation in the ubiquitylation cascade; and support therapeutic targeting of the inflammatory cell death axis in VEXAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 16:45:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1qZ2Nicm5PR0NBSTNCZ185eEotYkZpZDdqeUo0MzJ4UU84Y1pNTHJGdUxtY0t6UmphSVloUTl6dzVvVjBvMTZ5VlNkQWc3SUpQOUhjdHNDemtNWUx4N0Nj</guid></item><item><title>新的研究将褪黑激素与心力衰竭联系起来，但专家表示不要惊慌失措-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/11/03/melatonin-heart-failure-sleep-aid/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ILAJW3UZBCKRJD6OQXSXDLR7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A study that reviewed health records for tens of thousands of adults with chronic insomnia found that people who took prescribed melatonin for more than a year had a higher chance of heart failure over five years compared with people who were identified as nonusers, the American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/long-term-use-of-melatonin-supplements-to-support-sleep-may-have-negative-health-effects?preview=6f74&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" target="_blank"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;.

It causes pain that spreads across the body, fatigue that lingers, and sleep that never refreshes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often describe it as invisible &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chronic-pain-is-harder-to-treat-in-women-but-a-new-target-offers-hope/"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt; – constant but hard to explain. For years, science had no clear answer for why it happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major new study changes that story. Scientists from &lt;a href="https://www.decode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;deCODE Genetics&lt;/a&gt; and many global research centers analyzed data from more than 2.5 million people. Their work identified 26 genetic regions linked to fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings finally reveal a biological foundation for a condition often misunderstood or dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biggest-genetic-study-so-far"&gt;Biggest genetic study so far&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study gathered genetic information from 11 large biobanks, including UK Biobank, FinnGen, deCODE Iceland, and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the datasets covered 54,629 fibromyalgia cases and over two million controls. Researchers ran genome-wide scans to find tiny DNA differences more common in people with fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make the data comparable, each dataset went through strict quality checks. Any variant that looked suspicious or poorly measured was removed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After combining all of the data, the team performed a massive meta-analysis – one of the largest of its kind for a chronic pain disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discovery-in-the-brain"&gt;Discovery in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 26 variants, one stood out. It appeared inside the &lt;em&gt;Huntingtin&lt;/em&gt; gene, the same gene that causes Huntington’s disease when heavily mutated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fibromyalgia variant doesn’t trigger that condition, but it sits in a region important for neural maintenance. People carrying this variant had roughly nine percent higher odds of developing fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding shifts the focus from muscles to the brain. It hints that fibromyalgia’s roots lie within neural circuits that control pain sensitivity, not within inflamed tissue or joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-fibromyalgia-affects-the-brain"&gt;How fibromyalgia affects the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers looked closer, they found that most genetic activity connected to fibromyalgia happened in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-body-has-a-hidden-sixth-sense-interoception-that-helps-keep-us-alive/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enrichment tests showed signals clustering in cortical and subcortical areas, including the caudate nucleus and frontal cortex. A chart from the study displayed these tissues lighting up while others stayed quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern supports what clinicians have suspected for years – that fibromyalgia stems from a hypersensitive nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain and spinal cord amplify ordinary sensations, turning mild pressure into persistent pain. Genes like &lt;em&gt;CAMKV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;DRD2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MDGA2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;CELF4&lt;/em&gt; appear central to this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shared-fibromyalgia-pathways"&gt;Shared fibromyalgia pathways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored how these genetic changes connect to other diseases. Fibromyalgia shares DNA links with chronic fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The same genetic variations influence pain, mood, and sleep regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overlap extends even further. Some variants appear in conditions such as long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That overlap suggests one underlying biological network may shape many seemingly different illnesses – all tied to nervous system regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-genes-reveal-about-symptoms"&gt;What genes reveal about symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 26 identified genes explain why fibromyalgia symptoms stretch beyond pain. Several affect neurotransmitters and brain development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others control cellular metabolism and immune responses. Taken together, they describe a disorder driven by communication errors between nerve cells rather than by direct tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors noted that people with fibromyalgia often experience brain fog, anxiety, or sleep problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic results help connect these symptoms. When pain signaling misfires in the brain, every related function – thought, mood, and rest – becomes harder to regulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fibromyalgia-and-autoimmune-diseases"&gt;Fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia often gets confused with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. Both cause chronic pain, but their roots differ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This genetic study found no strong signals in the immune system’s major gene region, known as the MHC. That makes fibromyalgia unlikely to be a traditional autoimmune &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-set-the-record-straight-by-clarifying-common-myths-about-body-language/"&gt;condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, mild connections appeared between fibromyalgia and immune-related traits such as white blood cell count. The evidence suggests some immune involvement but not enough to define the disease as autoimmune. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it points to an interaction between brain and immune pathways that affect how the body handles stress and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-question-of-gender"&gt;The question of gender&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibromyalgia affects women far more than men. Yet genetics tell a different story. The study found no difference in genetic architecture between sexes. Men and women shared almost identical risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that environment, hormones, and life experiences probably amplify the shared genetic risk rather than create separate ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imbalance seen in clinics may reflect those external factors rather than differences in DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers built polygenic risk scores – calculations that estimate someone’s genetic likelihood of developing fibromyalgia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with the highest scores were significantly more likely to have the condition. These scores are not yet precise enough for clinical use, but they could become powerful tools for early detection in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such approaches might help identify people prone to chronic pain before symptoms worsen, guiding early lifestyle or medical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fibromyalgia-pain-and-daily-life"&gt;Fibromyalgia pain and daily life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond disease links, the study uncovered correlations with sleep patterns, metabolism, and body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genes associated with insomnia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes overlapped with fibromyalgia’s risk genes. That overlap explains why patients often report fatigue, sluggish metabolism, or difficulty maintaining energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also reveal the true complexity of fibromyalgia pain. It doesn’t come from one gene or one trigger. Instead, many small genetic effects work together, shaping how the brain perceives and processes discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clear-therapeutic-targets-revealed"&gt;Clear therapeutic targets revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly discovered genetic map offers clear therapeutic targets. The &lt;em&gt;Huntingtin&lt;/em&gt; regulator &lt;em&gt;GPR52&lt;/em&gt; already serves as a drug target in Huntington’s disease research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modifying its activity could help in fibromyalgia as well. Another gene, &lt;em&gt;CELF4&lt;/em&gt;, under investigation for chronic pain therapy, now becomes relevant here too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These connections create a hopeful path toward precision medicine. Future treatments may focus on restoring healthy nerve signaling rather than just dulling pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-many-challenges-remain"&gt;Many challenges remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study depends on medical records for diagnosis, which may misclassify some patients. Many cases go undiagnosed, while others receive fibromyalgia codes for overlapping conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most participants were of European ancestry, making it essential to include more diverse populations in upcoming research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these gaps, the dataset remains the most comprehensive ever assembled for fibromyalgia.

It is considered extremely rare, with its true incidence unknown because it is often misdiagnosed or overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This doesn't just trick a breathalyzer. Fermenting yeast, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11354181/Fatal-fungi-releases-list-dangerous-fungal-pathogens-growing-threat.html"&gt;typically Candida albicans&lt;/a&gt;, creates real alcohol in the bloodstream, leading to the same stumbling, slurring and mental impairment as if Jane had been drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dean Mitchell, a prominent &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-ad7bf510-b42f-11f0-8154-a97bfc676553"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; immunologist who works with ABS patients, told the Daily Mail: 'It's quite powerful to have somebody that literally didn't take a drink of alcohol and is failing a breathalyzer test.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell pointed to a clear pattern in his auto-brewery syndrome patients. Every single one had recently taken antibiotics, which are known to disrupt the gut's natural balance of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;After taking antibiotics and acid reflux medicine, teacher and mother Jane began fermenting carbs into alcohol in her gut. This condition caused her to fail breathalyzer tests twice while completely sober (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics wipe out both harmful and beneficial gut bacteria, creating a void that allows Candida yeast to proliferate unchecked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, after grabbing a cupcake to eat on her way home, a quick burst of sugar to carry her through dinner time, Jane soon felt bloated in her stomach and her concentration had become cloudy. Before she knew it, she had run a red light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A police officer pulled her over, suspecting she was drunk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her denial, a breathalyzer test confirmed his suspicion, leading to a citation and a court summons for a DUI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a second, equally baffling incident in which a police officer pulled her over, she was desperate for a medical explanation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It would be weeks before Jane’s doctor could issue and explain the diagnosis, auto-brewery syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A specific yeast in her gut, Candida, was fermenting the carbohydrates in her food, effectively brewing alcohol inside her own body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it all may have stemmed from antibiotic use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Once she was diagnosed with ABS, Jane finally had an explanation for her crippling fatigue, her brain fog and slurred speech, especially after eating carb-heavy foods (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Dr Dean Mitchell, a prominent New York City immunologist, told the Daily Mail that nearly all of his patients with Candida overgrowth have a history of long-term antibiotic use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell told the Daily Mail that widespread over-prescription of antibiotics ‘is a little bit heartbreaking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: ‘I see a lot of young people who've been on tetracycline for six months for acne, or I see people for chronic Lyme disease, the chronic sinus and bronchitis patients and the urinary tract patients. I'm not a believer that long-term antibiotics help those patients.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients journey to his New York City clinic reporting the same core symptoms: stubborn fatigue, brain fog, and bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For some, this progresses to full-scale intoxication, including dizziness, slurred speech, and blood alcohol levels sufficient to fail a breathalyzer test despite complete sobriety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He first rules out conditions like anemia. If standard tests are normal and the patient has a history of triggers like antibiotics or acid blockers, he uses a 15-questionnaire to help confirm a diagnosis of Candida overgrowth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He categorizes the condition into four stages. It typically begins with digestive issues like bloating after high-carb meals, then progresses to localized problems such as chronic sinusitis, vaginitis and unexplained rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell said: ‘Patients that I would see with chronic sinusitis and sometimes the other symptoms, like the GI symptoms, they're like, oh my god, I’ve seen an [ear, nose and throat doctor] for two years. He keeps on giving me antibiotics, he gives me steroids and I've had two operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then all of a sudden, I treat them for the Candida overgrowth and their sinuses get better and their fatigue gets better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Candida albicans, the yeast that causes ABS, is now a WHO "priority pathogen" because of its drug resistance. Though normally harmless in the gut, it becomes dangerous in immunocompromised individuals &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third stage involves debilitating neurological symptoms, such as severe brain fog that can be so intense that patients have had to leave their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell added: ‘I have these 20-year-olds say, ‘I have to leave my job. I'm working in finance and I can't do the rigors of what I need to do,’ and I work with them and they get better.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most severe stage encompasses systemic illness, including profound chronic fatigue and body-wide pain similar to fibromyalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mitchell's treatment begins with antifungal medication and a strict 30-day, low-carb diet to starve the yeast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then repairs the gut using targeted vitamins and nutrients to reduce inflammation and repopulate the microbiome with beneficial bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And in similar individuals who walk further, taking 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day, decline slows by an average of 7 years. The work also offers hints to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01200-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;how exercise alters the brain&lt;/a&gt; to offer this protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The very encouraging takeaway is that even a little bit of exercise seems to help,” says Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, a physician-scientist specializing in memory disorders at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and a co-author of the study, which was published on 3 November in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;. The research indicates that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03513-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03513-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;people don’t need to take 10,000 steps a day&lt;/a&gt;, a goal that is often touted but might be hard for some older individuals to attain, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Steps towards prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team ran regular checks on 296 people participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a programme that is investigating the early stages of Alzheimer’s. None of them had signs of cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. Over a period of up to 14 years, the team periodically assessed the participants — whose ages ranged from 50 to 90 — using cognitive tests and brain scans. Participants were also asked to wear pedometers to measure how many steps they took each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of people at a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease usually show an abnormal build-up of two proteins: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02535-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-02535-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;amyloid-β and tau&lt;/a&gt;. Although the relationship between the two proteins is not fully understood, amyloid-β levels begin to increase first, followed by tau levels. Cognitive decline seems to be more closely tied to the accumulation of tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of taking 3,000 to 7,500 steps per day were apparent only for participants with high baseline levels of amyloid-β in their brains. Their mental decline was slowed — by 3 to 7 years — compared with participants who were sedentary. The researchers didn’t see any further slowing of mental decline in participants who took more than 7,500 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But what does that mean exactly? It’s a term experts want to demystify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people can eat high-FODMAP foods without issue, as these are generally healthy foods that encourage growth of good bacteria,” says Samantha Dieras, RD, director of ambulatory nutrition services at Mount Sinai Hospital. “Persons with IBS can be more sensitive [to certain foods], and using a low-FODMAP diet to gain control of their symptoms may be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, the experts break down everything you need to know about low-FODMAP foods and figuring out whether this is the healthiest diet for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is FODMAP?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FODMAP is an acronym: fermentable, oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. According to Dieras, FODMAP refers to short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in your small intestine and fermented by gut bacteria in the large intestine, which can lead to water being drawn into the large intestine. Eating foods with high amounts of FODMAP can cause issues such as bloating, gas, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, as well as more sensitivity for anyone with IBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/"}' href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt; in Melbourne, Australia, has created &lt;a data-offer-url="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monash-fodmap-diet/id586149216" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monash-fodmap-diet/id586149216"}' href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/monash-fodmap-diet/id586149216" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an app&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to learning more about FODMAP, and it breaks down &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/"}' href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the acronym&lt;/a&gt; even further as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fermentable: something that can be fermented&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oligosaccharides: carbohydrates composed of simple sugars that can be found in foods like wheat, rye, and some legumes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disaccharides: found in dairy products, like milk, cheese, and yogurt&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monosaccharides: also known as fructose; found in things like corn syrup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Polyols: sugar alcohols known as sorbitol and mannitol that you can find in things like artificial sweeteners and also some vegetables and fruits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are low-FODMAP foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking at a FODMAP list, you’ll notice that many food categories have both low- and high-FODMAP foods. If you’re looking for low-FODMAP options, you can turn to the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Vegetables&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetables such as eggplant, beans, cucumber, and bok choy are some of the low-FODMAP options Dieras recommends adding to a low-FODMAP diet. You can eat them on their own, cook them as a side dish, or incorporate them into a salad, among other uses. The options are many, making this one of the easiest low-FODMAP food options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Fruits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monash University lists cantaloupe, kiwi, mandarin, and orange as &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/"}' href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some of the fruits&lt;/a&gt; low in polyols, making them low-FODMAP foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Meats and poultry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like meat, Dieras advises going as plain as possible. Plain chicken, beef, turkey, lamb, or pork are the best options for low-FODMAP diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a snack or garnish, low-FODMAP nut and seed options include macadamias, peanuts, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/pumpkin-seeds"&gt;pumpkin seeds&lt;/a&gt;, and walnuts, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/"}' href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Monash University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who should consider a low-FODMAP diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A FODMAP diet is a way for individuals with IBS or those experiencing digestive issues—such as bloating, gas, abdominal pain, or diarrhea—to identify which foods they can tolerate better, says Dieras. This will also allow the gut to rest and heal. If you aren’t experiencing much discomfort when you eat, then you are mostly okay to continue with your regular diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are there any risks to a low-FODMAP diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dieras says that a low-FODMAP diet can be restrictive, which comes with its own set of problems. “Restricting foods or food groups brings the risk of developing nutritional deficiencies, which may contribute to other health consequences,” she says. Balance here is key. You may be able to tolerate small portions of certain high-FODMAP foods or do a reintroduction phase so you don’t have to cut those foods off completely. It’s best to work with a registered dietitian or a health-care provider to determine the best and safest steps for your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the most common high-FODMAP foods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Dieras says it’s essential to note that high-FODMAP foods are considered healthy and shouldn’t be eliminated permanently unless necessary. However, if they are causing you issues, you need to learn how to adjust your diet in a way that suits you to improve your digestion. That said, the three most common high-FODMAP foods are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Wheat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that wheat is &lt;a data-offer-url="https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/97788/fodmaps-in-wheat" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/97788/fodmaps-in-wheat"}' href="https://repository.rothamsted.ac.uk/item/97788/fodmaps-in-wheat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high in&lt;/a&gt; oligosaccharides, so if you’re looking for better food replacements, Dieras says you can opt for quinoa and rice. Monash University also lists corn flakes, oats, and wheat-, rye-, and barley-free breads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Dairy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because dairy is &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/dairy-bone-health"&gt;a source of disaccharides&lt;/a&gt;, you might be better off with dairy alternatives. Dieras lists almond milk, lactose-free options, rice milk, cashew milk, and aged hard cheeses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Artificial Sweeteners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners contain both monosaccharides and polyols, which makes them high on the FODMAP food list. Better alternatives include dark chocolate and maple syrup, Dieras says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 15:59:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1EcUk1RW9tTktaV0w4aEt1Z0tiWmo4cjdqQlMyS2Y0ZGd2ZUJsMS1DOUlSX0lZMDd3MXB4NlNGaXpSQ2tZTXZnaWowWHNxWDVEV3c4UUhvazBiUQ</guid></item><item><title>怀孕期间的新冠肺炎是否与自闭症有关？一项新的研究显示了什么，它没有什么- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-pregnancy-autism-research-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A large study from Massachusetts found that &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/9900/neurodevelopmental_outcomes_of_3_year_old_children.1392.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;babies whose mothers had COVID-19 while pregnant&lt;/a&gt; were slightly more likely to have a range of neurodevelopmental diagnoses by age 3. Most of these children had speech or motor delays, and the link was strongest when the mother was infected late in pregnancy and in boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in risk was small for any one child, but because millions of women were pregnant during the pandemic, even a small increase matters. The study doesn't prove that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy causes autism or other brain conditions in the fetus, but it suggests that infections and inflammation during pregnancy can affect how a baby's brain grows, something scientists have seen before with other illnesses. It's reason to help pregnant women avoid COVID-19 and to keep a close eye on children who were exposed in the womb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital examined medical records from more than 18,000 mothers and their children born between March 2020 and May 2021, before vaccines were widely available. Because everyone giving birth during that period was tested for COVID, the team could clearly see which pregnancies were exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5% of those mothers had COVID while pregnant. Their children were modestly more likely to be diagnosed with a neurodevelopmental condition by age 3 than those whose mothers weren't infected, even after accounting for differences in maternal age, race, insurance status, and preterm birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link appeared strongest when infection occurred in the third trimester and among boys. Still, the vast majority of children in both groups showed typical development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was a very clean group to follow," said Dr. Andrea Edlow, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Mass General and one of the study's authors. "Because of universal testing early in the pandemic, we knew who had COVID and who didn't."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say COVID, which causes a powerful immune response in some people, fits the biological pattern seen with other infections in pregnancy. Dr. Alan Brown, a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia University, who studies maternal infection and brain development, explained, "COVID would be a very strong candidate for it to happen because the amount of inflammation is very extreme."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How might infection affect brain development?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are still piecing together how various types of infections in pregnancy affect fetal development. Severe illness can cause inflammation that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3978" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;disrupts brain growth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1307582110" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;trigger preterm birth&lt;/a&gt;, which carries its own risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a long history of evidence showing that maternal infection can slightly raise the risk for many neurodevelopmental disorders," said Dr. Roy Perlis, the vice chair for research in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital and co-author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edlow's lab is investigating how infection and inflammation may interfere with brain development. In a healthy brain, immune cells help shape developing neural circuits by trimming away extra or unnecessary connections, a process known as "synaptic pruning," which sculpts the brain's wiring. When a mother's immune system is activated by infection, inflammatory molecules can reach the fetal brain and alter the pruning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag3194" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Animal studies&lt;/a&gt; support Edlow's hypothesis. When scientists trigger inflammation in pregnant mice, their offspring often show changes in how brain cells grow and connect, changes that can alter learning and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why late pregnancy and why boys?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Edlow and Perlis' study, the link between COVID and developmental delays was strongest when infection occurred late in pregnancy, during the third trimester. That's also when the fetal brain is growing most rapidly, forming and refining millions of neural connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we think of organ development, we think earlier in pregnancy, but the brain is an exception in this regard, where there's a massive amount of brain development in the third trimester. And that continues after birth," said Perlis. "It is entirely plausible that the third trimester is a period of vulnerability specifically for brain development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everyone agrees the third trimester is uniquely vulnerable. Dr. Brian Lee, a professor of epidemiology at Drexel University, cautioned that because most mothers in the study were tested at delivery, there were simply more late-pregnancy infections to analyze. "That gives the study more power to find a difference in the third trimester," he said. "It doesn't prove earlier infections aren't important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found stronger effects in boys. That pattern is familiar: boys are generally more likely than girls to have speech or motor delays and to be diagnosed with autism. Researchers suspect that male fetuses may be more sensitive to stress and inflammation before birth, though the biology isn't fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study can and can't show&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edlow and Perlis are careful to say the study shows an association, not proof that COVID infection in pregnancy causes developmental problems. &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(22)00264-4/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Many other factors&lt;/a&gt; could explain the link.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mothers who get sick with COVID may also have other health issues, like obesity, diabetes or mental health conditions, that increase the risk of developmental delays in children. "Persons with &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wps.20806" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;mental disorders&lt;/a&gt; are much more likely to get COVID. Women with mental disorders are much &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1536042/full" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;more likely to have kids with neurodevelopmental problems&lt;/a&gt;," Lee said. "Mothers with &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;worse physical health&lt;/a&gt; are also at higher risk of having children with neurodevelopmental problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee's research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159114004528?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;even infections before or after pregnancy can be linked to autism&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that shared genetics or environment, rather than the infection itself, could be at play. That's why experts say much larger, longer studies are needed to understand the extent of any risk from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edlow, Perlis and their team plan to follow the children in their study as they grow older to see whether early differences persist or fade. They're also studying how inflammation during pregnancy affects the placenta and fetal brain, and how to counteract those effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about vaccination?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this study followed pregnancies from early in the pandemic, before vaccines were widely available, it doesn't answer whether vaccination changes the risk. But other research offers reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large national study in Scotland &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352464225000082" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;found no difference in early developmental outcomes&lt;/a&gt; between children whose mothers were vaccinated and those who weren't. Another study in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2814106" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;found the same&lt;/a&gt;: no link between prenatal COVID vaccination and developmental delays through 18 months. Both align with decades of data showing that vaccination during pregnancy is safe for both the mother and the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccination is a short spike… your immune system revs up, then it goes back to normal," said Edlow. "COVID [infection] is much more prolonged, unpredictable, and people can get… a dysregulated immune phenomenon that really doesn't exist in vaccine responses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for parents and clinicians&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since late 2020, there's been widespread confusion and misinformation about the safety of COVID vaccination during pregnancy. Some women have hesitated to get vaccinated out of fear it might harm their baby. But the evidence since then has been clear: the COVID vaccine is safe in pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;strongly recommends COVID vaccination&lt;/a&gt; to protect &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-pregnancy-protects-newborn-babies-cdc-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;both mother and child&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the broader lesson is that pregnancy is a period of vulnerability, and prevention matters, not only &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-vaccine-pregnancy-study-unvaccinated-pregnant-women-stillbirth/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;for COVID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, but other infections as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Janet Currie, a professor of economics at Yale University, said these risks remain "underappreciated," despite decades of evidence. "Even though the flu vaccine is recommended for pregnant women, very few pregnant women get it," she said. "Physicians seem to be reluctant to vaccinate pregnant women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Dr. Gil Mor, scientific director of the C.S. Mott Center for Human Growth and Development at Wayne State University, put it, "Protecting the mother is protecting the long-term health of the offspring. … The best intervention is vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A century-old echo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that what happens in the womb can shape life after birth began with studies of famine, like the Dutch Hunger Winter in the final months of World War II. Between 1944 and 1945, as German forces blockaded the western Netherlands, rations fell to just a few hundred calories a day. Thousands died of starvation, and women who were pregnant during that period gave birth to babies who later faced higher risks of &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/84/6/595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)07244-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/495981" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;. The episode became a cornerstone of the "&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)90710-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fetal origins&lt;/a&gt;" idea, that deprivation or stress in pregnancy can have lifelong effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.25.3.153" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;1918 flu pandemic&lt;/a&gt; broadened that idea to infection. Babies exposed to influenza in utero later showed small but lasting &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/507154" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;differences in education and earnings&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first signs that illness during pregnancy could affect brain development. Research in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24997382/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Taiwan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2727135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953611006368" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Switzerland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19691044/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28371628/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; found similar impacts. Some argued that those findings reflected the &lt;a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w24725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;disruptions of World War I&lt;/a&gt;, not the flu itself. But &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24725" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;later studies&lt;/a&gt;, including those from the &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41304838" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/494237" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt;, have strengthened the case for a biological effect, reinforcing that the infection itself, not wartime upheaval, was the key driver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It isn't simply influenza that can alter fetal neurodevelopment," Dr. Kristina Adams Waldorf, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at UW Medicine, explained. "Many types of infections… in the mother can be transmitted as a signal to the fetus, which can alter its brain development."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A century later, the same question has returned with COVID: could infection during pregnancy subtly shape how children grow and learn? The new Massachusetts General Hospital study offers an early look at the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
