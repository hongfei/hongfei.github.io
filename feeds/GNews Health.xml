And last month, a person with measles &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/03/25/dc-measles-case/"&gt;traveled&lt;/a&gt; from Minnesota to visit D.C. while contagious. That person had ridden an Amtrak train, walked through the concourse at Union Station and went to an urgent care center in Adams Morgan a few days later, according to the city health department. This year, there have been more than 700 confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/measles-is-spreading-heres-how-to-stay-safe/" target="_blank"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Two people died of measles-related illness. Another death is currently under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K2AHDLBW7RBGVJ2UK4ZUQX3VLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://dchealth.dc.gov/page/measles-information-healthcare-providers"&gt;Measles &lt;/a&gt;is a highly contagious disease and spreads easily through the air when an infected person sneezes, coughs or breathes. Symptoms can show up from seven to 14 days after exposure and may include a fever of over 101 degrees, along with a cough, red and watery eyes and a runny nose. After the initial symptoms begin, there is another stage three to five days later. It includes a distinctive rash on the face that spreads to the rest of the body. Health officials said someone with measles is contagious from four days before the rash appears until four days after it emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FPAMNZIFEJASJGHLGQ7IATEAUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Officials said in a statement that if a person has received “two doses of a measles-containing vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are protected and do not need to take any action.” For someone who has received only one dose of a measles-containing vaccine, health officials said, “you are very likely to be protected and your risk of being infected with measles from any of these exposures if very low.” But they advise contacting a health-care provider about getting a second vaccine dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RJKLWZW2YVFSHAUZ7JNTMWD6VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Those who are exposed and at risk of developing measles should look for symptoms until 21 days after the date of their last exposure. If a person notices symptoms of measles, officials said, they should isolate themselves by staying home and away from others and get in touch with a health-care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-correction" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;div data-qa="correction-disclaimer" class="wpds-c-fZDGxM wpds-c-fZDGxM-iPJLV-css"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="disclaimer-headline" class="wpds-c-kAVFVG"&gt;correction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-contentid="YZE5I2QQNFCLFOVTAQP6JZYKTI" data-apitype="correction" data-testid="disclaimer-description" class="wpds-c-joLgjs"&gt;A previous version of this article incorrectly said there have been nearly 490 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. this year.

but is widely used off-label for weight loss — especially among celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, fans are speculating that stars like &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/sharon-osbourne/index.html" id="mol-07f2ca00-1a16-11f0-9cce-837db1b5260f"&gt;Sharon Osbourne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/oprah-winfrey/index.html" id="mol-07f08010-1a16-11f0-9cce-837db1b5260f"&gt;Oprah&lt;/a&gt; Winfrey may be among the first to show signs of the surprising foot-related side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Osbourne, 72, recently posted a cozy Instagram photo with her grandson — but eagle-eyed commenters were quick to point out signs of extreme weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, TV spectators have also noticed excessive wrinkling on 71-year-old Oprah's feet when the American host and television producer was seen onstage at the 55th NAACP Image Awards at Shrine Auditorium in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-07f784f0-1a16-11f0-9cce-837db1b5260f"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sharon Osbourne took to Instagram to share a cozy picture of herself with her two-year-old grandson and pet dog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The skin on the top of the foot is delicate, thin and has lower fat reserves than the bottom or sole of the foot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As you age, the fat pads in the foot can become even more scarce and lead to loose skin and wrinkles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking weight loss drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro can significantly reduce the fat reserves in the whole body, including the feet - leading to excessive sagging and wrinkles due to muscle loss, Dr Weintraub said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eagle eyed fans were quick to notice the strange wrinkling on Osbourne's feet in her Instagram post from April 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The star's perfectly smooth facial complexion, which some users claimed was achieved with a filter, contrasted her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Instagrammer commented: 'Beautiful airbrushed photo but feet tell your age'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While another quipped: 'How strange when the skin on your hands and feet don't match the skin on your face'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, while many thought that she was simply showing signs of aging, Dr Weintraub believes otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained to this website: 'Seeing veiny and sagging skin on the top and sides of the foot is most likely a result of the new lack of water retention due to a decreased BMI caused by Ozempic and other such weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the heart becomes less taxed with extra weight, the water retention decreases, and the substructures of the foot (veins, tendons, bones) often become more visible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, Winfrey said taking weight-loss drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14315339/oprah-winfrey-ozempic-realize-truth-people.html"&gt;helped her realize the truth about 'thin people.'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, the media mogul finally admitted to using an undisclosed GLP-1 - a type 2 diabetes medication that can also aid in weight loss - to shed nearly 50 pounds after decades of yo-yo dieting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having nearly reached her goal weight of 160 pounds (72kg), Winfrey revealed her experience taking a GLP-1 and what it has taught her about 'thin people.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the things that I realized the very first time I took a GLP-1 was that all these years I thought that thin people had more willpower,' Winfrey confessed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Barry Weintraub, a New York-based board certified plastic surgeon exclusively told DailyMail.com that a loss of fat in the body can impact water retention in the body and cause excessive sagging in the feet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;TV spectators have also noticed excessive wrinkling on Oprah Winfrey's feet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They ate better foods. They were able to stick to it longer. They never had a potato chip.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she is yet to comment on which weight loss drug she took. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neither Osbourne or Winfrey have commented on whether they are suffering from any side effects from intake of their respective weight-loss drugs.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Most Americans consume more than enough protein while being deficient in fiber, genetic epidemiologist Dr. Tim Spector says.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Beans provide healthy plant protein along with fiber and other beneficial nutrients like polyphenols.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Whole grains are higher in protein than many expect while offering fiber and various micronutrients.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Reducing red and processed meat consumption benefits health while diversifying plant proteins provides all necessary amino acids.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li class="ai-article-summary__item"&gt;Nuts and seeds are solid sources of plant protein and have healthy fats, vitamins and minerals.&lt;/li&gt;

            Americans are in the middle of a love-affair with protein.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000g3b6mh8ozsgna@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A stroll through almost any major supermarket — where food labels tout grams of protein — bears witness to the trend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000h3b6my9qedpi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And why shouldn’t we be? Along with carbohydrates and fat, protein is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594226/" target="_blank"&gt;one of the three main macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; that make up our diet. Furthermore, it is the only macronutrient that supplies us with amino acids, making it essential for survival.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000i3b6mysdz95lv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557845/" target="_blank"&gt;Amino acids&lt;/a&gt; have a hand in &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002222.htm" target="_blank"&gt;many bodily processes&lt;/a&gt;, such as building and preserving muscle, making hormones and neurotransmitters, boosting the immune system, even maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. And while our bodies can make some of the needed amino acids, it can’t make them all. Enter dietary protein.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000j3b6mjkoixlbv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What is the optimal amount you should be getting? The answer is that it’s complicated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000k3b6mtf4ryifw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;recommended dietary allowance&lt;/a&gt; (RDA) of protein for adults 18 and older is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 grams per pound) per day, which translates to about 54 grams of protein for a 150-pound person, or 72 grams for someone weighing 200 pounds. &lt;a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/cnpp/dietary-guidelines-americans" target="_blank"&gt;Established jointly&lt;/a&gt; by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Health and Human Services, the RDA represents the minimum amount of protein that must be eaten by a relatively sedentary person to meet the basic needs of their body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000l3b6m2fevekr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s also something called the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR), which was developed by the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/dietary-reference-intakes-for-macronutrients" target="_blank"&gt;National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine&lt;/a&gt; to establish ranges for carbohydrates, fat and protein that are associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases. Those guidelines, which put intake within the context of &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002467.htm" target="_blank"&gt;an entire diet&lt;/a&gt;, recommend protein make up between &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/11537/chapter/7" target="_blank"&gt;10% and 35%&lt;/a&gt; of the calories in an adult’s diet. (The &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/myplate-plan" target="_blank"&gt;number of calories per day&lt;/a&gt; an adult should be getting depends on characteristics such as age, sex, weight and activity level.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000m3b6mfc1637j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All that is to say, there is no exact number for the amount of protein that you should be getting. If you look at &lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/usual/Usual_Intake_gender_WWEIA_2017_March%202020.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the statistics&lt;/a&gt;, most people in the United States are getting more than enough; if you listen to some influencers, you are not getting enough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000n3b6mdmhc4pqe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I was in L.A., and I did some interviews there, and nine out of 10 people I asked, ‘What did you have for breakfast?’ — it was raw eggs or protein bars or protein smoothies. It was amazing,” Dr. Tim Spector told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life. Spector is a genetic epidemiologist and researcher at King’s College London and founder of one of the world’s largest twins registries, TWINS UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000o3b6mhhvkvxg7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’ve been sort of brainwashed into thinking that they have to move on to protein because they’re somehow deficient and they’re not going to be lean and have a six-pack and be running marathons (if they don’t),” he said. Spector is also author of several best-selling books including “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Life-Science-bestselling-SPOON-FED/dp/1787330494" target="_blank"&gt;Food for Life: The New Science of Eating Well&lt;/a&gt;.” (He’s also a co-founder of ZOE, a personalized nutrition app).
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Spector has nothing at all against protein per se. “In general, protein is pretty good, particularly if it’s plant protein — but, nothing wrong with meat protein in moderation. But it’s what it replaces,” he said. “We need to start thinking much more holistically.”&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000s3b6m4x0zk6a7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Studies have shown that Americans have more than enough protein,” he added. “There might be a few exceptions out there, but most people are already on twice the amount, and &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" target="_blank"&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" target="_blank"&gt; 90% of Americans are deficient in fiber.&lt;/a&gt;”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000t3b6mxm8gxn9j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spector said certain groups may require a bit more protein: older adults, people going through &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/menopause-fatigue-heavy-bleeding-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;   or recovering from serious illness, those with restrictive diets and people who are “training incredibly hard.” But the rest of us — in the United States, at least — do just fine. (Many people &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-per-capita-protein-supply" target="_blank"&gt;in developing countries&lt;/a&gt; do not &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/africa/pabra-new-beans-africa-spc/index.html"&gt;get adequate protein&lt;/a&gt;.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlinte000u3b6m6ibwkxg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you find that you need it, how can you get some additional high-quality protein into your diet — while benefiting from other important nutrients and without relying on highly processed sweetened powders and snack bars? Here are Spector’s top five tips.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000x3b6mmbnqg4yn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They come in many forms — black, pinto, broad, kidney, and more — but they never get the attention they deserve,”  said Spector via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000y3b6mdyq1xuxe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re all good sources of healthy plant protein,” he noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf000z3b6mxv3rdano@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beans are also loaded with other good-for-you nutrients. “Importantly, they also contain fiber (a nutrient that most people really are deficient in), and other healthy plant compounds, like polyphenols,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00103b6mr1x27xvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Load up on the three-bean salad or bean burrito. Those &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/15/health/canned-dried-beans-recipes-wellness/index.html"&gt;bean are inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;, come in a wide variety and, if you buy them dried, are extremely shelf-stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00123b6m3aqrgsy7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hearty and versatile, whole grains — such as barley, brown rice, buckwheat, bulgur, corn, millet, oats, quinoa, rye and whole wheat — contain the entire grain kernel, including the bran, germ and endosperm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00133b6mryo47on4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whole grains are good for a wide range of reasons,” said Spector via email. “They are a great source of fiber and include a wide range of micronutrients. They’re also much higher in protein than people expect. For instance, oats have 11g of protein per 100g compared with 13g per 100g for eggs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00143b6mxythvizf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Regularly consuming whole grains is associated with a reduced risk of many health conditions, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes,” he noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00153b6m92ukwn8q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An easy way to get more in your diet? “Swap products that contain highly refined grains — like white rice, pasta, and bread — for whole grain versions, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and wholewheat bread,” he said.  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00183b6m50imfjnn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many of us love a good burger or steak, but eating too much of a good thing is not so good for you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf00193b6m8itw2uin@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s true that meat is a great source of protein,” Spector said. “However, for your health and the health of the planet, it’s best to reduce your meat intake, particularly red and processed meat.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001a3b6mmf3swdc0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some people worry that most plants are not complete proteins, so they might be missing out on specific amino acids,” he noted. “But each plant source of protein has a unique amino acid profile. By consuming a wide variety of plants, you will naturally take in all the amino acids you need.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001b3b6mctxn0qo0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And  don’t panic. Nobody is saying you have to cut out meat entirely. “Consider replacing half of the meat in your stews, chilis, or soups with mixed lentils and beans, tofu, or tempeh, or have one or two vegetarian or pescetarian days each week,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001c3b6m4zxgu775@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When you do eat meat, Spector added, “try to choose good quality products and opt for leaner cuts.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm9hlioi7001r3b6muj52kxhg@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="go-nuts-over-nuts-and-seeds" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Go nuts over nuts and seeds
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001e3b6mtm283mae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many people avoid nuts and seeds because they’re relatively high in fat,” Spector said. “Although this is true, they contain healthy unsaturated fats, like monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which support good health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001f3b6mqqlnkohu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may come as no surprise to find “they’re also a good source of healthy plant protein and a wide range of vitamins and minerals,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001g3b6mrrgndqmt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are not a fan of munching on straight-up nuts or seeds, Spector said you can sprinkle them on most dishes “savory or sweet — to provide extra texture and flavor.” Consider adding them to your yogurt parfait, salad or stew.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001h3b6meegofhe2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Peanut butter is also a good choice, he said, “but find a product with as few ingredients as possible, and no added sugar or salt.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001k3b6mfx3c1ppl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Soy is one of the few complete proteins in the plant world,” Spector said. “It’s also incredibly versatile and can easily be incorporated into meals. Consider adding tofu, tempeh or edamame to the dishes you already love.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001l3b6mrphcx2g4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As an added bonus, he said, “soy products contain fiber and are rich in vitamins and minerals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001m3b6m5tkcla2z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When it comes to protein, Spector said most people should seek out quality over quantity. “Focus on plants, and ignore products that claim to be high in protein, because they’re probably also high in salt, sugar, and other additives your body doesn’t need,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlintf001n3b6mnqqxaw3a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For over fifty years&lt;/strong&gt;, the scientific community has grappled with an unsolved puzzle in the realm of human blood types. It all began in 1972 when doctors discovered something extraordinary during the blood analysis of a pregnant woman. Her blood sample lacked a surface molecule that was otherwise present on every other known red blood cell. After decades of research, scientists have finally cracked the case, unveiling a &lt;strong&gt;new blood group system&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Blood Group Discovered&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough, &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/144/26/2735/517404/Deletions-in-the-MAL-gene-result-in-loss-of-Mal?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, marks a major milestone in the field of hematology. The discovery not only answers an age-old question but also opens the door to improving medical care for individuals with rare blood types. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Louise Tilley, a UK National Health Service hematologist, was instrumental in this accomplishment, having &lt;strong&gt;spent nearly 20 years investigating &lt;/strong&gt;the genetic anomaly. The new &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group adds to the already extensive list of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/scientists-discover-a-second-heart-that-powers-our-blood-circulation/"&gt;blood systems&lt;/a&gt;, such as the well-known &lt;strong&gt;ABO&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rh&lt;/strong&gt; groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; is different from these major systems, being based on the absence of an antigen called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AnWj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers found that &lt;strong&gt;more than 99.9% &lt;/strong&gt;of people have this antigen on their red blood cells. The patient in 1972, however, lacked it entirely, leading to an extensive investigation by a team led by Tilley.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the MAL Blood Group?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group gets its name from the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; protein, which is known to play an important role in cell membrane stability and cell transport. The discovery of this new blood group comes after years of research into the genetic cause of &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood types.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers were able to confirm the connection between the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene and the absence of the &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt; antigen by inserting a normal &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene into cells from patients who lacked the antigen. This insertion successfully reintroduced the &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt; antigen to those cells, confirming the gene’s pivotal role.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tilley explained that the work was challenging due to the rarity of the condition: “The work was difficult because the genetic cases are very rare.” This rarity made it particularly tough to identify the genetic markers responsible for the anomaly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Underpinnings of MAL&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When individuals possess a mutated version of both copies of their &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; genes, they exhibit an &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood type. This discovery was crucial because it enabled the team to identify patients who carry this rare blood type. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found that some individuals with this blood type did not have the expected genetic mutation, indicating that other medical conditions could suppress the antigen’s presence on the red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers observed that all patients with &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative blood shared the same mutation. However, no other abnormal cell characteristics or diseases were found to be linked with this &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/mice-with-a-human-gene-mutation-start-talking-differently-and-it-might-be-why-we-speak/"&gt;mutation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The identification of the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; blood group has substantial medical consequences. As &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; is an extremely rare blood type, understanding its genetic origins enables healthcare professionals to provide better care to patients with this blood group. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, with the discovery of the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; gene, doctors can now test patients to determine whether their &lt;strong&gt;AnWj&lt;/strong&gt;-negative status is inherited or caused by some form of genetic suppression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Satchwell, a biologist at the University of the West of England, noted the complexity of identifying the &lt;strong&gt;MAL&lt;/strong&gt; protein: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“MAL is a &lt;strong&gt;very small protein &lt;/strong&gt;with some interesting properties which made it difficult to identify and meant we needed to pursue multiple lines of investigation to accumulate the proof we needed to establish this blood group system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

He moved from the US to Europe, where he credits the shift in lifestyle and better food quality for his dramatic results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Striking before-and-after photos of the 33-year-old show a clear difference: his pot belly is gone, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14578141/how-lost-50kg-without-ozempic.html"&gt;replaced by a defined chest&lt;/a&gt;, sculpted obliques, and a healthy glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not just about appearances - Dave says blood tests back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before leaving America, his cholesterol levels were flagged as 'elevated.' Eight months into his European life, new tests revealed his numbers had not only dropped, but hit 'optimal' levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dave, who previously lived in Reno, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nevada/index.html" id="mol-d0bb79d0-1a18-11f0-ba7d-df39445cacbf"&gt;Nevada&lt;/a&gt;, claims he made zero conscious effort to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-d0b6bee0-1a18-11f0-ba7d-df39445cacbf"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; or get fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He insists he didn't overhaul his diet or start working out. In fact, he leaned in even harder to indulgence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I arrived in Europe, I didn't follow any diet plans,' he said. 'I drank copious amounts of wine and beer and ate all the local delicacies wherever I went.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I wasn't about to pass up the pain au chocolat in Paris or the duck and dumplings in Prague.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before and after photos of Dave Alastair, 33, show him modeling a svelter physique after his time overseas, and he says medical tests also showed an improvement in his health. His tattoos are flipped in the 'after' photo as it is a mirrored selfie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite his indulgent diet, Dave found the pounds dropped off and he puts this down to a variety of differences between Europe and the US when it comes to food and lifestyle choices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Firstly, the YouTuber believes that 'food in Europe is much more high quality and doesn't have things like additives, fillers (ingredients added to food products primarily to increase volume and bulk), genetically modified organisms and chemicals' in it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingredients distributor Tilley Distribution highlights why this difference in ingredients occurs between the two regions. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It notes: 'In the US, the FDA takes a notably more hands-off approach to testing and inspections, often allowing new food ingredients unless proven harmful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This includes ingredients, for example, GMOs, growth hormones and chemical preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In Europe, the EFSA requires additives to be proven safe before approval and has banned the use of growth hormones and several chemical additives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe the ultra-processed nature of US food versus European products may play a role in weight gain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, many pasta brands in the US use thickening agents, coloring agents and additives like emulsifiers which prolong their shelf life which have been linked to bloating, sluggishness and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pasta, meanwhile in Europe, is usually made with just semolina wheat flour and water, leaving out the preservatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And science suggests the lack of processed foods could have real benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study in The Journal of Nutrition, for example, found pasta that is less processed tends to digest slower, slowing down the rate that glucose enters the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amie Alexander, a registered dietitian at Nutri Peak in Australia, previously told DailyMail.com that portion sizes also tend to be smaller in European countries such as Portugal, Spain and Italy, which could help with digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Meals are also combined with other nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, which can further blunt blood sugar responses.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next up, Dave says he has observed how Europeans drink lots of coffee and smoke more than Americans, which could help in curbing hunger pangs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown that coffee may be beneficial for weight loss when consumed in moderation and without excessive added sugar or cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2023 study followed the coffee habits of more than 150,000 participants and found that drinking unsweetened coffee was associated with a modest reduction in weight gain over four years after adjusting for other lifestyle variables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Despite his indulgent diet, Dave found the pounds dropped off and he puts this down to a variety of differences between Europe and the US when it comes to food and lifestyle choices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A photo of Dave when he was living in America before his transformation &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With each additional cup, the coffee drinkers gained about a quarter of a pound less than their peers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, it is well known that nicotine in cigarettes suppresses appetite and increases metabolism, and also serves as a distraction from hunger or food craving, despite the massive increased risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While he didn't change his workout regime, Dave said he started walking lots more after relocating to Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The globetrotter reveals: 'There's no doubt that when I'm in Europe I walk so much more than I do in the United States and I think this is by design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During the automotive boom in the early 20th century many deals were done to invest heavily in highways instead of trains and that's how America became such a car-centric culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I do think this contributes to Europeans walking a lot more on average than Americans.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Walking after a meal has consistently been shown to help food digest more quickly and gas move throughout the digestive system easier, preventing bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2022 study even found that a two-minute walk after eating helps lower blood sugar levels because muscles will soak up extra glucose in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Dave says that food in US grocery stores is generally more unhealthy than in Europe and the fast-food culture is another major culprit in the obesity epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains that in America breakfast cereals are 'just made up of corn and sugar' while organic grocery stores such as Whole Foods are only accessible to wealthy shoppers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, in Europe healthier food is more accessible, he says, with more fresh produce and farmer's markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the topic of fast food, he tells viewers in one of his YouTube videos: 'I also think it is the culture as well where people in the United States choose the easier faster option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's such a fast-paced life in the United States that sometimes it's easier just to go through a drive-thru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After posting about his weight loss experience in Europe, many viewers responded with similar tales&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, there are fast food drive-thrus in Europe but most people choose different, healthier options and eat fast food in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fast food in Europe is much smaller portioned than the ones in the United States.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To conclude, Dave says he doesn't claim that 'if you move to Europe you will magically lose all of this weight and be super healthy but for some strange reason this has been the case for me and I kind of don't even know how it happened'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After posting about his weight loss experience in Europe, many viewers responded with similar tales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One commenter wrote: 'I lived in Barcelona for a year and the same thing happened to me. And I ate all the things; fresh bread and other baked goods, fried things and drank wine everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;' When I returned to Los Angeles I was lighter than I ever was, and had zero food allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Here in LA I find it beneficial to eat low carb, gluten free and abstain from alcohol if I want to feel good and not gain weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another viewer revealed: 'I noticed the same thing when I was over there. My first two weeks in Europe were in Portugal and that's where I noticed the biggest difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was walking/exploring more. My stress level dropped to NOTHING and my food seemed much healthier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went over with a 31' waist and came back to the US at nearly a 30' waist. My two-liter became a six pack again and I honestly felt 10 years younger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We had Sangria and Gelato on a regular basis but I just have a feeling that everything was more natural and not full of preservatives.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In 2000, it was 1 in 150.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The most striking piece of this is how unbelievably common  presentations of autism are,” said Zachary Warren, an author of the new report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Warren, also the executive director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD) in Nashville, Tennessee, largely attributed the increases to improvements in detecting the developmental disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors are better than ever at identifying autism, with awareness at an all-time high. “Without a doubt, we’ve become exceptionally efficient in this surveillance work,” Warren said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What other factors could be causing the rise in autism? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Answers are both inconclusive and wildly complicated. Potential causes have been scrutinized for decades, and there doesn’t seem to be a single smoking gun. The leading theory lies in genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We have pretty compelling data that there are causes of autism, not a single cause,” Warren said. “We may have hundreds, if not 1000s, of different neurogenetic factors that influence presentations of autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Despite proven research to the contrary, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-vaccine-autism-summit-age-rfk-jr-rcna200240" target="_blank"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;. has repeatedly suggested that vaccines — specifically the shots that protect against measles, mumps and rubella — are linked to autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/autism-vaccines-kennedy-cause-spectrum-rcna180837" target="_blank"&gt;link has been widely debunked&lt;/a&gt;, but continues to contribute to a decline in vaccine uptake across the U.S. — even amid a growing measles outbreak that’s sickened hundreds and killed two young children in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC study also looked at autism diagnoses among 4-year-olds, estimated to be 1 in 34 in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Boys were three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with autism. Diagnoses were also more common among Black and Hispanic children compared with white children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The disorder appears to be a focus of the Trump administration. Both the president and Kennedy have said it’s critical to find what’s causing autism in kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During a meeting at the White House last week, Kennedy said his agency will move forward with a “massive testing and research effort” to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-says-hhs-will-determine-cause-autism-september-rcna200768" target="_blank"&gt;find the cause of autism by September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;It was unclear how the HHS effort would be different from previous research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:00:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPSlhvZlRhd2s0RllEZ3BNajVOMnlPOE9jc1pBQ0NEM2JlSm9xZno4bjB3bVRGRU5zVlRoaE5yTlFMMmV0eXhZRHRDajh5Ui1peDRjMnZ3Sl9HMXpLcWI2SHM3X0hWZXltVlp6dWtxMU9nWGJXSklWZXJ6SXhVUEo5SWZZTGVVY2FHUTUyVGhIZVRhdENKUkJF0gFWQVVfeXFMT2FJWjBfRzZkVXNlQ3NmTjFXU1JHRnZnM2dtMm9vRVJZREV1STIzRHZkWHdObkpmV1NJSnI2S29oZ3BBUnpCNFZ4UmNiT3ZqUWpmSXpyVlE</guid></item><item><title>如果您不喜欢锻炼，这里有一种科学支持的方法可以让您变得更健康-《华盛顿邮报》 | Here’s a science-backed way to get healthier if you don’t like exercise - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPelYxTVlQaHE4cUFna1ZCY3BvMmpEOGRoZlpuV2tfOXpGNC1nQVhDMFhYQWZNcHMxQ0ltdmFSR01Ic2FWb0xySG8xM2tYcDlVcWl0R2tic2l1UW11bTB2VHJpZGJPblJCanpDM2tUWUl6UEx1Q3A5ak1nZVJOeDg0S2hLa3lMLUtMT1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D3KTKIQSZFAYTCDBBKZVOEEDEU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re not a fan of working out or simply don’t have time, we’ve got good news for you. Doing everyday chores and activities a bit more briskly might lead to big gains in health and longevity, a new study shows. That means you could tweak how you clean your house, climb stairs or run for the bus and get some of the benefits of exercise without a trip to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V2T2URIODFCPDJRR6HVT5ULGFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the study, published this month in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072253" target="_blank"&gt;Circulation&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed the daily movements of more than 20,000 adults over the course of about a week. None formally exercised. But some moved with more zip than others as they went about their lives, taking the stairs instead of the escalator, for instance, or speed vacuuming their living rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UJWXQE5S6FAVRACTR626AWTUVY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The amounts of these everyday exertions were small, the study found, often less than five minutes a day, but the impacts appeared outsized. Those who moved around briskly were as much as half as likely to experience or of a heart attack or stroke in the following years as people who almost always dawdled through their days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24PWXMFKKZDPRI5T6AW4X22V4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests that “it’s a good idea to find ways to fit exertion into your daily life,” said Emmanuel Stamatakis, a professor at the University of Sydney, who led the study. “But that doesn’t mean you have to actually exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="IONFTEBDQNBHTNAFW4WLNHFCAI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="IONFTEBDQNBHTNAFW4WLNHFCAI"&gt;The science on movement vs. exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="R3DLRVHSDBBHBITJ6ZJAB2FF6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study advances a growing area of research into whether and how we can be healthy without exercise. For the past few years, Stamatakis and his colleagues have been using data from the immense UK Biobank to explore that issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2NA53PF4NJDELCOLBL6AV62RNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The biobank has enrolled tens of thousands of British adults, who provided health information and tissue samples. Many of them also wore advanced activity trackers for a week, which provided detailed readouts of how they spent almost every moment of their days at work and home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QMNZ3ADGV5EK7E47IODP2TS5QU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In past studies from his lab, Stamatakis and his co-authors analyzed those readouts and related health and death records. They discovered that people who said they never exercised but who often moved around at what scientists call a vigorous pace — meaning they got out of breath as they ran for a bus or sprinted intensely up the stairs — typically developed fewer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39467622/" target="_blank"&gt;serious&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2807734#google_vignette" target="_blank"&gt;diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02100-x" target="_blank"&gt;lived longer than people&lt;/a&gt; who rarely, if ever, moved vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYWLJIFQAZDYVALAG7SYRSVNLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But Stamatakis knew, as an exercise scientist, that a lot of people are intimidated by words like vigorous and intense, in the context of exercise and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2FYD4V2Z3FD3ZKONM2JGODDADU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, for the latest study, he and colleagues decided to see whether gentler forms of everyday activities might also be associated with better health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="K364TQKVTZANVMWADBCISXC4F4" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="K364TQKVTZANVMWADBCISXC4F4"&gt;Moving in short bursts has greatest benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SKHEGXVUJFEAXPRZQ4UYPAFD44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In simple terms, physical activity can be light, moderate or vigorous, depending on how hard you push yourself. Light-intensity activities feel easy enough that you can chat with someone without puffing and even sing. During moderate activity, you’re still able to talk, a little breathlessly, but not sing. When activity grows vigorous, you can barely speak without gasping, and you certainly can’t sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGVV6SDWZ5HY5N4UUQ6U3LUIBA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To conduct their study,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Stamatakis and his colleagues used algorithmic machine learning to closely analyze movement patterns in 10-second increments and determine whether someone was moving lightly, moderately or vigorously. They used biobank tracker records from 24,139 adults who never formally exercised, then cross-checked against hospital and death data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OPFFFEJKAJA5TPPBE7OGUXBNAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What they found was that light everyday activities, which might include strolls to pick up lunch or visit the copier, slightly reduced risks for cardiovascular problems and deaths during the next eight years, compared to people who recorded almost zero activity (meaning they remained seated for almost the entire day). But people needed more than two hours a day of light activity to see much benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L5FGGWMDMJG7LOEO4WWWDMUXYM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Moderate everyday activity was far more potent. If people spent 24 minutes a day moving around at a moderate pace, their risks of developing or dying from cardiovascular problems dropped by as much as 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRPMO7L76FEBXIY5JFNKE2TLTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And the most effective dose of vigorous everyday movement was even lower. Barely five minutes a day of pacing around or rushing places while huffing and puffing was associated with nearly 40 percent less likelihood of dying from heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="3UIOKAMTJ5DSJGUYCQCHV2EKRM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="3UIOKAMTJ5DSJGUYCQCHV2EKRM"&gt;Clean and garden as fast as you can&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66247GDTT5ARHC65LZWWO7THCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;From a practical standpoint, the takeaway of the new study is straightforward, Stamatakis said. “Look for opportunities” to ramp up the intensity of chores and activities, he said, especially if you don’t often exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6XJILI5YPFBVRIEQ6ZFVLDKUH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Taking the stairs will be moderate activity for most people,” he said. Hurrying up them will be vigorous. Or pick up the pace while you walk, swinging your arms, “which is what we call sprint walking,” he said, “and is moderate. Or garden as fast as you can. There are plenty of opportunities to add a little more exertion” to what you’re going to be doing anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Z4VWMKHK25HK5PLRQGBAUYKLDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study has limitations, of course. It mostly involved White, educated Brits. It’s also possible that people who move through chores slowly have underlying health problems, predisposing them to heart risks, without any contribution from their daily movements. But the researchers excluded anyone who experienced heart problems in the first year of the study, lessening that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6IZ5KSMNGZEL5E37UOZLLM3YPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Perhaps most important, the findings aren’t meant to discourage exercise. “You can do both,” Stamatakis said, exercise and push yourself sometimes as you go about your day, assuming that your health and circumstances allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDV2ZLKCKFHEZCLZ6E7QGNALRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s quite a good study, both the methodology and the message,” said Martin Gibala, an exercise scientist at McMaster University in Canada, who studies exercise intensity but was not involved with this research. The results suggest that, even if you choose not to exercise, sprinkling a little moderate or vigorous everyday activity into your life “can have meaningful health effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 17:00:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxPelYxTVlQaHE4cUFna1ZCY3BvMmpEOGRoZlpuV2tfOXpGNC1nQVhDMFhYQWZNcHMxQ0ltdmFSR01Ic2FWb0xySG8xM2tYcDlVcWl0R2tic2l1UW11bTB2VHJpZGJPblJCanpDM2tUWUl6UEx1Q3A5ak1nZVJOeDg0S2hLa3lMLUtMT1E</guid></item><item><title>1岁的麻疹患者可能在7个地点暴露了其他人：英厄姆官员-底特律新闻 | 1-year-old with measles may have exposed others at 7 locations: Ingham officials - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPUkdWYk9mLTJxSHF5cFpueEJxT0stNG83LXFTWWVsQWNCQllmSjFFNVJCYkNubHhiamkyNFVMWno1NU5ZNVctdlhhZTl5UjhHTnE3SnBnZ2pHUk9ZSFM3Yk1yRHJBN25kVE03cTFtQkk2Q2dORDlZbERKWVF6anE5aU1pUGEwU0ZSMkl1M3JvNkJ6bGI0NFM4a2MtUUhuampNYk80NTYxVld0SG9rdHBQbWhtS054eHE1U25hb1dVcVU2YXJZWG9lbGFXT3NoNURhNzdJSEJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Health officials on Monday confirmed the state's fifth measles case of the year in a one-year-old girl from Ingham County, who may have exposed others to it at multiple locations during a four-day period, according to the county health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles is a very contagious disease spread through person-to-person contact and the air, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.

The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine is the best protection against the disease, and two doses are roughly 97% effective at preventing measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Children can receive their first dose of the measles vaccine between the ages of 12 and 15 months, and their second between the ages of four and six years old. Anyone who is not vaccinated is at risk for serious health complications from measles, especially children below the age of five, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Ingham County Health Department encouraged everyone to check their vaccination status and is providing doses at its immunization clinic in Lansing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The MMR vaccine is safe, effective, and remains our best defense. Two doses provide 97%protection," Shoyinka said in the news release. "We strongly urge residents to check their vaccination status and contact a healthcare provider if symptoms appear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Ingham County child had a recent history of traveling outside of Michigan, and the county's health department is investigating the location and time of her exposure, the news release said. She is the fifth measles case confirmed in Michigan this year.

Two-thirds of Americans &lt;a href="https://civicscience.com/a-growing-number-of-americans-consider-medications-for-springtime-allergy-relief/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; spring allergies, and about 4 in 10 say they take an allergy medication several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But those medicines, while valuable, don’t exactly fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.00237.x"&gt;One 2001 study&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom found 60 percent of people who took some kind of over-the-counter medication for allergies reported they were not satisfied with how it managed their symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nasal sprays are not exactly enjoyable or easy to operate. Allergy medicines have to be taken every day if you deal with serious hay fever, and they can produce, ironically, tiredness for some people during this season of renewal. A missed dose can lead to a day of hacking and sneezing. Oh, and the more you take them, the less likely they are to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A century ago, antihistamines were a revolution in allergy treatment. But now, we’re on the cusp of another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Omalizumab, sold as Xolair, is an asthma medication that was approved more than 20 years ago, but it has proven successful in treating seasonal allergies in recent preliminary trials. So successful, in fact, that now some doctors in the US are prescribing it for certain patients during hay fever season. It is an injection, rather than a pill or a spray, that’s given a couple of weeks before pollen and grass levels start to rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One obvious benefit is you get a single shot and enjoy your spring. But even better, omalizumab can forestall allergic reactions at the source. That means an injection could stop &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; allergic reactions — not only seasonal allergies but &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312382"&gt;food allergies&lt;/a&gt; (such as peanuts) and insect allergies for a prolonged period of time. This class of treatment — monoclonal antibodies, special artificial proteins that carry instructions to the body’s immune system — have the potential to be a genuine all-in-one allergy wonder drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The biggest advantage of antibody-based therapeutics is that they offer the potential to target the underlying pathways driving allergic reactions in general,” said Sayantani Sindher, a clinical associate professor at Stanford University’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research. “This means antibody-based therapies will simultaneously impact all of the patient’s allergens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Large clinical trials are underway in China and Japan, which could lead to omalizumab’s approval in those countries for seasonal allergies. The next generation of monoclonal antibody allergy treatments is already in the works. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-monoclonal-antibodies-could-stop-allergy-season-before-it-starts" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How monoclonal antibodies could stop allergy season before it starts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the United States, the use of monoclonal antibodies started with doctors studying and prescribing preexisting treatments “off label” — meaning these are drugs that were actually developed for something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Asthma and seasonal allergies often occur in tandem, which made omalizumab an obvious candidate for a new approach to allergy treatment. The drug had also separately proven effective in treating food allergies, adding to evidence that it had the right properties to stop seasonal allergies at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The treatment has demonstrated significantly better outcomes than antihistamines in small randomized trials, requiring only one dose two weeks before pollen and grass season. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/clt2.12094"&gt;A 2022 study&lt;/a&gt; reported that patients who received a 300 mg injection of Xolair experienced fewer symptoms and fewer days that required a daily antihistamine or other medication; the patients also reported a better quality of life during the allergy season. Their symptoms were particularly improved during the worst pollen days when compared to the people who only took a daily medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When pollen and other allergens emerge every year and enter your body through your eyes, ears, or nose while you’re enjoying the crisp spring air, your body’s immune system overreacts. Immunoglobulin, proteins that are supposed to identify and attack parasites or a virus, instead go after the otherwise harmless allergen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When the immunoglobulin attacks the allergen, your body releases histamine, a chemical critical to inflammation (which, again, is really important when you are actually exposed to a dangerous parasite or virus). That inflammation then creates all that mucus and sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Monoclonal antibodies stop that process before it begins. They deliver artificial proteins that carry instructions to your immune system to block the receptors that create allergic reactions and prevent the overresponse that releases histamine in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Artificially altered antibodies have been around for decades, with different iterations being developed to respond to new health threats. Monoclonal antibodies were developed for &lt;a href="/science-and-health/23495149/covid-19-treatment-monoclonal-antibody-therapy-drug"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic and recently provided the platform for &lt;a href="/future-perfect/23800167/rsv-shot-infants-fda-antibodies-vaccine-flu-health"&gt;an RSV vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dupixent.com/"&gt;Dupilumab&lt;/a&gt; (another monoclonal antibody treatment used for skin rashes, asthma, and a lung disease that makes it difficult to breathe called COPD) targets a different receptor but has likewise shown promising results in studies so far. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29355679/"&gt;In a large 2018 study&lt;/a&gt;, asthma patients who suffer from seasonal allergies received a 300 mg injection every two weeks and showed significant improvements in their nasal blockage. A 2022 study &lt;a href="https://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749(21)02060-1/fulltext"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; fewer allergy symptoms among both people with allergic asthma and people without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Monoclonal antibody injections superficially resemble allergy vaccines, which have been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/08/710243786/seasonal-sniffles-immunotherapy-tablets-can-replace-allergy-shots-for-some-aller"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; more aggressively in recent years. Those shots as well as oral tablets that work in the same way function differently: They expose people to small amounts of the actual allergen, giving their bodies a chance to develop natural immunity to it. They can unlock more durable resistance to specific allergies — but they can only treat one allergy at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You may also need to go to the doctor once a week for a month or longer during the initial treatment course. Some companies are trying to make them easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Going forward, the conventional kind of allergy vaccine could still have a place, particularly for patients who are at particularly high risk of developing asthma, by strengthening immune systems for the longer term; monoclonal antibodies, by contrast, do not actually modify the immune system in the same way, so they would need to be taken again periodically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But Sindher emphasized the potential to treat all allergies at once as an obvious advantage for monoclonal antibodies over immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Pollen allergy and food allergy are frequently found together,” she said. “Omalizumab has the potential to treat both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With monoclonal antibody shots, patients also report fewer side effects. There is a subset of people for whom antihistamines don’t work, including those who have built up a tolerance to those drugs after frequent usage. These new monoclonal antibodies may help them where those old treatments are now failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Specially tailored allergy-specific products are now in the works, ushering in this new era of allergy treatment. In early April, the final stage of one clinical trial found the following results after four weeks: Patients who had still reported symptoms after taking the standard-of-care treatment and then received a monoclonal antibody injection were much more likely to report mild or no nasal symptoms (62 percent) than people who were taking the placebo (39 percent). They scored significantly better on oral symptoms and other measures of efficacy without serious side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The drug in the clinical trial, Stapokibart, was recently &lt;a href="https://firstwordpharma.com/story/5945250"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; for seasonal allergy treatment in China, and its developer, Keymed, has &lt;a href="https://endpts.com/how-keymed-steered-the-china-to-us-newco-model-in-biotech/#:~:text=Keymed%20Biosciences%20is%20a%20prime,four%20NewCo%20deals%20since%20July."&gt;premised its business&lt;/a&gt; on developing and gaining approval for treatments in that country and then bringing them to the US. Monoclonal antibodies will continue to make inroads as more products come to the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="a-new-era-for-allergy-treatment" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;A new era for allergy treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Monoclonal antibodies, by offering months of allergy relief in just one injection, could elide &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544319122003089"&gt;one of the biggest challenges in all pharmaceutical treatments&lt;/a&gt;: making sure people take medicines like they are supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Omalizumab is a promising new treatment for seasonal allergies, but the FDA has not specifically approved it for seasonal allergy care yet. So far, doctors have been prescribing this “off label” — meaning it has proven safe to use for a different purpose, but the science on its effectiveness for allergies is preliminary. A prescription is ultimately at your doctor’s discretion, but if you suffer from severe allergies, it could be a fit for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here are some things to consider asking your physician if you’re interested in this kind of treatment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Are there other existing treatments they would advise trying first?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Do I have another condition for which Xolair is intended to treat?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What steps should we take for my health plan to cover the cost?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With antihistamines and nasal sprays, you must regularly buy them yourself and repeatedly remember to take them correctly to stave off allergy symptoms. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1046/j.1365-2222.1998.00237.x"&gt;That 2001 study in the UK&lt;/a&gt; found that many people who suffered seasonal allergy symptoms nonetheless did a poor job of taking medication as they should: Among the 54 percent of people who were experiencing poor allergy symptoms, 70 percent didn’t use the conventional allergy medicines according to the clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But for allergy sufferers to make the jump from something like Claritin to an annual allergy shot that works even better, health insurance coverage will be critical: The list price on omalizumab is &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/price-guide/xolair"&gt;$1,500 a pop&lt;/a&gt;. This would be a new cost to health plans because patients often bear their own over-the-counter antihistamine med costs. Off-label coverage of any drug, including omalizumab for seasonal allergies, can be fickle. Some popular plans, such as United Healthcare, &lt;a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/comm-medical-drug/xolair-omalizumab.pdf"&gt;are not currently covering&lt;/a&gt; the drug for that use at this time because they consider it unproven. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As more research comes in and more products come on the market, the insurers’ value proposition may change.

Scientists are investigating whether these small particles have any lasting impact on cellular health, especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that consistent contact with these particles might correlate with certain changes in the body linked to age-related conditions. Some experts think this interaction warrants closer inspection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project was co-authored by Tan Ma from &lt;a href="http://www.rcees.ac.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Beijing Environmental Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, who has examined how these substances disrupt important cellular systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tracing-plastic-exposure"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tracing plastic exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People encounter &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-pose-a-greater-threat-to-some-ocean-animals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; in items like synthetic fabrics or disposable packaging. &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/microplastics-and-nanoplastics-foods" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; are even smaller and can remain hidden in many everyday settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have spotted them in water sources and even in common household dust. The concern is that humans might accumulate them across decades with unknown consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-of-premature-aging"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Signs of premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.7b00423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;papers&lt;/a&gt; propose that ongoing contact with these particles can stir up harmful cell processes, including persistent inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/even-mild-inflammation-can-majorly-damage-the-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; often appears as people age, which might speed up natural aging. This emerging &lt;a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-024-05731-5"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; has many scientists asking if these plastics add extra stress at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/damaged-mitochondria-recycled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; help power daily functions by creating energy for cells. They also help process byproducts that might damage tissues if left unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts see these organelles as a key indicator of healthy aging. Interference in their normal operations may link to conditions later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microplastics-and-premature-aging"&gt;Microplastics and premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022001258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;note&lt;/a&gt; that small plastic bits can enter cells through multiple pathways. Once they get inside, they might shift how cells manage waste or handle stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disturbance can weaken some of the checkpoints that keep cells balanced. If mitochondria lose efficiency, the body might face a higher load of problems related to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that they are there and are transported throughout the body, but we don’t know yet if they can cross the blood-brain barrier,” said Dr. Sherri Mason, a noted researcher on microplastic pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions about how these particles gather in the body are driving new studies. Lab tests aim to see how these fragments move through different organs throughout a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some specialists think that data will help regulators set safer standards for plastic production. Others emphasize personal measures, like filtered water, to lower daily exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-oxidative-stress-from-foreign-particles"&gt;Oxidative stress from foreign particles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advanced years, certain disorders may accelerate if &lt;a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-microbiology/chapter/cellular-defenses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cellular defenses&lt;/a&gt; falter. Scientists have linked these mini-plastics to changes often found in cardiovascular or neurological ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; can emerge when foreign particles disrupt normal metabolic cycles. That stress might make the aging process even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental agencies may reconsider plastic guidelines in light of these findings. Calls for improved waste management reflect a broader move toward reducing pollution at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers propose stricter rules for single-use products. They also suggest more robust screening of manufacturing methods to cut back on plastic byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-avoiding-microplastics-and-premature-aging"&gt;Avoiding microplastics and premature aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain people might opt for reusable items to minimize exposure. Others explore technologies that trap or break down plastic waste before it enters the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point out that these moves could help until more significant policy shifts take hold. Public awareness remains a big part of sparking any meaningful change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-influence-of-microplastics-on-aging"&gt;Influence of microplastics on aging &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field is evolving, so scientists still lack a complete picture of how microplastics might trigger &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-too-much-can-cause-premature-aging-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;premature aging&lt;/a&gt;. Ongoing trials could reveal whether there is a direct cause and effect with early aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful studies will quantify how different doses affect cells over time. Findings might also identify groups most at risk for higher accumulations of these plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This attention to small plastic debris reflects rising worries about synthetic waste in society. Public health experts want to see if new tests can clarify whether such particles directly influence advanced age ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-further-research-is-needed"&gt;Further research is needed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many labs are joining forces to track the pathways of these materials. This wave of collaboration may give us a broader sense of how plastics connect with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/aging-hotspot-found-in-the-brain-may-hold-the-key-to-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With older populations growing worldwide, it is vital to understand everything that might influence later stages of life. Researchers suggest that these tiny particles deserve more scrutiny for the sake of public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ongoing work will aim to uncover any hidden risks or unexpected benefits that come from our frequent use of plastics. The future of aging research may hinge on how we handle these discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027869152500122X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; point to a connection between these materials and shifts in cellular energy production. These findings highlight how damaged mitochondria may ramp up age-linked health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who monitor &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ocean-plastic-pollution-has-become-a-global-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt; say safer disposal methods and product alternatives might be ways to cut down on microscopic fragments. Taking small protective steps could be wise until deeper studies clarify the exact dangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027869152500122X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Food and Chemical Toxicology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 15:41:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQU184Vks5aTBaTEltZm9CYl84cndzWHFZUU1pX0hER3I1eUlkMUMxZmtIZEp0MkpMdjJ6UUFnQUNaTm5CaDlVWHgyYjVUWHhZclI1c2VGMzU2Q3NsYlFSdXdRZlpvRVNlQ1JicW1NUGVhRE40MWVydkxuSVQ2cWRaZG5hR0d0VG0wUFZNWkM4OFE</guid></item><item><title>“食肉”外阴感染呈上升趋势，医生警告- Gizmodo | ‘Flesh-Eating’ Infections of the Vulva Are on the Rise, Doctors Warn - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOVUo0VlNVZk9HcXgtWWRpcERxQi0tbzlFenJkbXNXOTVrRkpyTjZDNVZrUl9KVEJVdlhMUnQ0YzNFVE5vN0Ffejl0UDBsMml6bXg4QzNmVmxxbU02S204WDhrclNVdmVaR0lmd0RvMklvdXZCQkRWSWltY1hyclEyRm5wUHZzN3hGT0FxcnlQSl9lN0lmYW03OEZGcDE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A rare but horrific kind of infection might be on the rise. Gynecologists in the UK have begun to see an alarming increase in people with necrotizing fasciitis of the vulva, a.k.a. the “flesh-eating” disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust detailed three such cases in a paper &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/18/4/e263792"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in BMJ Case Reports. All three women were hospitalized, and one died as a result. These cases are part of a growing trend in the UK, the doctors say, and infections that can cause necrotizing fasciitis are increasing in the U.S. as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23103-necrotizing-fasciitis"&gt;Necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt; is a serious type of bacterial infection that destroys the soft tissues underneath our skin (particularly fascia, hence the name). While the appearance of this infection might resemble freshly-chewed flesh, the bacteria aren’t actually eating it away. Once this destruction starts, it can rapidly spread and trigger other life-threatening complications like sepsis. People can die from necrotizing fasciitis in &lt;a href="https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/healthlinkbc-files/necrotizing-fasciitis-flesh-eating-disease#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20very%20severe,a%20minor%20cut%20or%20bruise."&gt;as little as 12 hours&lt;/a&gt; after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though there are several different species of bacteria that can potentially cause necrotizing fasciitis, it remains a rare occurrence overall. But the report authors say they’ve noticed a significant uptick lately in cases involving the vulva (the external parts of the female genitalia) at their hospital, which includes the three described in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In two of the cases, the women were diagnosed with vulvar necrotizing fasciitis in the emergency room. In the third, the woman developed it as a complication from an infected surgical wound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One woman had seen a doctor five days earlier after noticing a spot on her mons pubis, and was prescribed antibiotics. But the treatment failed to clear the infection, and by the time she was hospitalized, the infection had spread throughout her labia majora, lower abdomen, and left hip. Despite surgical removal of her infected and necrotic tissue (also known as debridement) and intensive care support, the woman died of sepsis just 28 hours after her diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other two women survived their ordeal, though not without serious difficulty. Both needed “extensive surgical debridement” and one woman underwent three separate surgeries to remove tissue, which later required reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These cases are only part of a worrying pattern that the doctors have noticed. They identified 20 cases treated at their hospital between 2022 and 2024, compared to 18 reported in the entire previous decade. And they’re not the only ones spotting an overall rise in “flesh-eating” infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, for instance, a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832277"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the rate of invasive group A &lt;em&gt;Streptococcus &lt;/em&gt;(GAS) infections—the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/group-a-strep/about/necrotizing-fasciitis.html#:~:text=Experts%20believe%20group%20A%20Streptococcus%20(group%20A%20strep%20bacteria)%20are%20the%20most%20common%20cause"&gt;most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;—had more than doubled in the U.S. between 2013 and 2022. Several countries in Europe, including the UK, have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/12-12-2022-increase-in-invasive-group-a-streptococcal-infections-among-children-in-europe--including-fatalities#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20European%20countries,under%2010%20years%20of%20age."&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; a recent increase in GAS infections.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though necrotizing fasciitis remains rare in general, the doctors hope their report can help alert other ob-gyns to the possibility of these cases, particularly since speedy medical care is needed to prevent death. “With our review of three cases, we aim to raise awareness of this condition among gynecologists, who have limited familiarity with it,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These infections can be fatal anywhere they start, but vulvar necrotizing fasciitis is especially deadly, with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3104625/#:~:text=If%20treatment%20is%20not%20initiated,mortality%20as%20high%20as%2050%25"&gt;a mortality rate as high as 50%&lt;/a&gt; without timely treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invisible chemicals rising from children’s mattresses may be harming their brains and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s according to a &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5c03560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pair of studies published Tuesday,&lt;/a&gt; which found troubling levels of plastic-like “phthalate” chemicals and flame retardants in the bedrooms of children under 4.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Parents should be able to lay their children down for sleep knowing they are safe and snug,” co-author Arlene Blum, executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there are some steps that parents can take to help keep their kids safe, the problem is pervasive, researchers argued.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Canadian scientists found that the weight and temperature of the sleeping child helped create a plume of trace chemicals that filled the bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These chemicals can harm the nervous and reproductive system. They also mimic and interfere with systems of hormones, or chemical messengers that help control virtually all bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the University of Toronto argued that much of the responsibility lies with manufacturers and policymakers. Decades-long campaigns have sought to ban phthalates and plasticizers in children’s toys and furniture, with limited success.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even where these efforts have been successful, manufacturers don’t always follow them, and government regulators often don’t enforce them. Tuesday’s study found several mattresses containing chemicals that were banned in Canada — suggesting manufacturers weren’t testing for compounds known to be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;This controversy is particularly fierce around flame retardants, which Blum noted “have a long history of harming our children’s cognitive function and ability to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar chemicals are required by law in the interior of cars — where a &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4649281-chemicals-car-interiors-cancer-required-federal-law-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2024 study found&lt;/a&gt; that they increased cancer risks for tens of millions of commuters. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those requirements remain despite repeated findings that so-called flame retardants do little to slow the spread of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They do, however, make those fires “smokier and more toxic,” as a spokesperson from the International Association of Fire Fighters said last year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mattresses across North America may pose a similar threat, Tuesday’s findings found. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite some benefits in reducing flammability, federal research from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) has found flame retardant chemicals cause &lt;a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/flame_retardants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;widespread, insidious harms&lt;/a&gt; as they slough off mattresses and furniture.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23154064/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;These include links to&lt;/a&gt; impaired attention, cognition and fine motor skills in school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And for phthalates, which are used to make plastic-derived compounds more supple, researchers have found that there &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4491881-for-thousands-of-common-chemicals-there-is-no-safe-level-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;may be no safe level of exposure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phthalates alone caused nearly $70 billion in added health costs just in 2018, a &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/equilibrium-sustainability/4401535-plastics-pollution-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2024 study found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Copious research has found that exposure to phthalates and flame retardants is harmful to people of all ages. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the NIEHS notes that the risk is particularly stark for children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s because children breathe up to 10 times faster than adults — allowing them to take in far more airborne contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Their skin is also more permeable to toxins than adults’ skin, and they frequently put potentially toxic objects from their homes into their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Tuesday’s findings, scientists focused on manufacturers and North American governments, which they said had to do more to ban dangerous plasticizers and flame retardants from mattresses and toys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there are some things that parents and caregivers can do, they said. First, wash and change a child’s sheets and blankets frequently, because these offer the best shield against the mattress.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Second, they continued, declutter the sleeping area by removing excess blankets and toys — which are likely sources of contamination themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, they advised avoiding bright-colored sheets and blankets, which often include chemicals meant to block the assault of ultraviolet light — compounds that pose an additional threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the researchers emphasized that this was not a problem parents could solve for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The study is “a wake-up call for manufacturers and policymakers to ensure our children’s beds are safe,” co-author Miriam Diamond of the University of Toronto said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent groundbreaking study has revealed an astonishing natural event: &lt;strong&gt;terrestrial animals&lt;/strong&gt; that managed to journey across the &lt;strong&gt;Pacific Ocean&lt;/strong&gt;, covering an immense &lt;strong&gt;8,000 kilometers&lt;/strong&gt;, to settle on a new continent. This remarkable feat is considered one of the longest &lt;strong&gt;transoceanic migrations&lt;/strong&gt; ever undertaken by a &lt;strong&gt;vertebrate animal&lt;/strong&gt;, with the exception of those carried by &lt;strong&gt;humans&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318622122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the animals involved in this extraordinary migration now inhabit the &lt;strong&gt;islands of Fiji&lt;/strong&gt;. Interestingly, these creatures share a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/first-ever-pig-liver-successfully-transplanted-into-human-body-a-revolution-in-transplant-science/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="84198" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genetic link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; with animals found in the &lt;strong&gt;Americas&lt;/strong&gt;, raising questions about how they managed to travel such a vast distance. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous theories proposed that the animals might have reached these distant lands through ancient &lt;strong&gt;land bridges&lt;/strong&gt; that existed millions of years ago. However, this new study suggests an entirely different possibility: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/largest-ever-great-white-shark-atlantic/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83490" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;maritime migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How &lt;strong&gt;Cyclones&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Currents&lt;/strong&gt; Helped Animals Travel Across the &lt;strong&gt;Ocean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings present an unexpected explanation for how these animals managed their transoceanic voyage. &lt;strong&gt;Simon Scarpetta&lt;/strong&gt;, an &lt;strong&gt;evolutionary biologist&lt;/strong&gt; and lead researcher of the study, suggests that the animals didn’t actively choose to embark on such a long journey. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead, they were most likely swept away by a &lt;strong&gt;cyclone&lt;/strong&gt; that overturned the trees where they lived. These trees, caught in &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/earths-most-powerful-ocean-current-is-dying-and-no-one-is-ready/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81434" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;powerful ocean currents&lt;/a&gt;, acted as rafts, carrying the animals across the Pacific Ocean to their new home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scarpetta points out that the journey was not a matter of mere survival, as these animals, including &lt;strong&gt;prehistoric iguanas&lt;/strong&gt;, have long been known for their ability to&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/scientists-discover-thousands-of-giant-living-eggs-in-an-underwater-volcano/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83783" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; survive harsh environments&lt;/a&gt;. These creatures can endure extreme famine and dehydration, which would have been essential for surviving the long oceanic crossing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The floating trees would have also provided much-needed sustenance, as the animals could feed on the vegetation that floated alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prehistoric Iguanas&lt;/strong&gt;: Survivors of the &lt;strong&gt;Harshest Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The animals at the center of this remarkable story are &lt;strong&gt;prehistoric iguanas&lt;/strong&gt;, herbivores that originally lived in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/mysterious-wild-cat-caught-arizona-desert/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7550" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;desert environments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Known for their incredible resilience, these creatures can survive for long periods without food and water—traits that would have been indispensable for their survival during such an arduous journey. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Scarpetta, these iguanas’ ability to withstand prolonged periods of dehydration and hunger would have been key to enduring the oceanic voyage. Remarkably, these prehistoric iguanas are genetically related to species in the &lt;strong&gt;Americas&lt;/strong&gt;, adding more intrigue to their extraordinary migration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As they were transported across the ocean by floating vegetation, the iguanas likely used the time on the rafts to nourish themselves and conserve their energy, allowing them to survive the lengthy journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Record-Breaking Journey&lt;/strong&gt; Compared to Other Animal Migrations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the iguanas’ oceanic journey is certainly impressive, it is not the first time that animals have migrated across large bodies of water. More than &lt;strong&gt;36 million years ago&lt;/strong&gt;, primates from &lt;strong&gt;Africa&lt;/strong&gt; crossed the &lt;strong&gt;Atlantic Ocean&lt;/strong&gt;, a distance of approximately 1,000 kilometers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the distance covered by the prehistoric iguanas far exceeds this earlier migration, making it the longest known &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/humpback-whale-sets-record-for-longest-migration-ever-is-this-journey-a-warning-sign-for-ocean-chaos/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73519" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;transoceanic animal migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to date. This comparison underscores the sheer magnitude of the iguanas’ journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Unlike the primates, who may have had assistance from floating vegetation, the iguanas’ journey demonstrates their unique ability to survive and thrive in the harsh conditions of the open ocean, far from their native land.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        Stopping to smell the roses is one thing. But dawdling through life could come with added health risks, according to new research. Researchers analyzed the daily movements of more than 24,000 adults who did not formally exercise over the course of a week, finding those who made small exertions—vacuuming with speed or taking the stairs instead of the escalator—were as much as half as likely to experience a heart attack or stroke in subsequent years as those who moved slowly, per the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/15/get-healthier-without-exercise/"&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The study, published Monday in &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072253"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggests "it's a good idea to find ways to fit exertion into your daily life," study author Emmanuel Stamatakis, an exercise scientist at the University of Sydney, tells the outlet.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                                        His past research found people who don't formally exercise but move at a vigorous pace, to the point of getting out of the breath, live longer and have fewer serious diseases than people who move more slowly. For this study, Stamatakis and colleagues analyzed records from 24,139 adults who wore fitness trackers, none of whom exercised regularly. People who engaged in two hours of light daily activities, like a walk, had slightly reduced risks for cardiovascular issues and deaths over the next eight years compared to those who recorded almost no activity, while people who moved at a moderate pace for at least 24 minutes a day had up to a 50% lower risk of cardiovascular issues and deaths.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Those who engaged in incidental activity of vigorous intensity for just over five minutes per day, meanwhile, were up to 38% less likely to suffer a serious heart event or death, per the &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/this-is-the-least-you-need-to-do-to-reduce-your-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-20250403-p5lotj.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Though it could be that those who move slowly are hindered by health problems that leave them predisposed to heart risks, Stamatakis says there's an opportunity here for people to hurry up daily tasks, like gardening or walking up stairs, to push them into the moderate or vigorous category, adding more exertion and potentially lowering health risks without having to set foot in a gym. While structured exercise is "far superior" for health and fitness, a bit of huffing and puffing can still provide meaningful benefits, Stamatakis tells the &lt;em&gt;Herald&lt;/em&gt;.

Researchers targeted the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—key in planning and action—while participants performed simultaneous visual and auditory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anodal stimulation, which enhances brain activity, led to quicker decisions, while cathodal stimulation, which suppresses activity, made participants stick to previous choices. Though subtle, these results suggest tDCS may modulate cognitive flexibility under specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Brain Area:&lt;/strong&gt; Stimulation focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which regulates planning and decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effect on Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Anodal stimulation sped up task choices, while cathodal stimulation reduced adaptability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes were subtle (~100ms) but statistically significant in experimental psychology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A simple method of brain stimulation has been shown to change how people make decisions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These were the findings of a new study by the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU), which was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigation used transcranial direct current stimulation, which is an established method in research and therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108766"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study found that with anodal stimulation, which increased the activity in the region of the brain, the participants needed less time overall to choose the task; in other words, the decision was made more quickly. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In transcranial direct current stimulation, a very weak electric current flows through electrodes that have been placed on the scalp. This can be used to activate or inhibit specific regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In anodal stimulation, a positive electrode is applied, which increases the activity of the nerve cells. In contrast, cathodal stimulation uses a negative electrode and inhibits activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The method has great advantages as it is non-invasive and very easy to use. This is why it is widely utilised in psychology,” says Dr Sebastian Kübler, a psychologist at MLU. Its potential use in treating neurological and mental disorders is also being intensively investigated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists at MLU are studying whether direct current stimulation influences how people make decisions. In the study, which included 40 study participants, a specific region of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was stimulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The region is crucial for planning and weighing up actions,” explains Torsten Schubert, a professor at the Institute of Psychology at MLU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants had to complete two tasks at the same time – an auditory and a visual task – and had to decide which one they would solve first. The test subjects wore the electrodes throughout the entire experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, at the time of the study, neither they nor the researchers knew what type of stimulation was being used or whether any current was flowing at all. The experiments were repeated at intervals of at least one week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that with anodal stimulation, which increased the activity in the region of the brain, the participants needed less time overall to choose the task; in other words, the decision was made more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When cathodal stimulation was applied, which inhibits brain activity, participants tended to stick with a previously chosen order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that an activated or inhibited dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increases or reduces cognitive flexibility when people have to perform several tasks simultaneously,” says Sebastian Kübler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference was found to be in the range of around 100 milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This seems small at first, but in experimental psychology it is a relevant change. It appears that transcranial direct current stimulation changes a person’s ability to decide which action to take,” explains Torsten Schubert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devices that use transcranial direct current stimulation are now even being sold commercially and are touted as being able to increase creativity and concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Such sweeping promises are not credible. However, our study does show that the method can, under controlled conditions, influence cognitive processes such as decision-making. It should also be noted that the effects are very subtle and depend on many factors,” says Kübler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain stimulation and decision-making research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e3a212360222b2120262f3c2a3a0e3c2b253a213c2f3a603b202763262f22222b602a2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tom Leonhardt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-halle.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tom Leonhardt – Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_02270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Modulates Voluntary Task-order Coordination in Dual-task Situations&lt;/a&gt;” by Sebastian Kübler et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Modulates Voluntary Task-order Coordination in Dual-task Situations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dual tasks (DTs) require additional control processes that temporally coordinate the processing of the two component tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies employing imaging as well as noninvasive stimulation techniques have demonstrated that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) is causally involved in these task-order coordination processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in these studies, participants were instructed to match their processing order to an externally provided and mandatory order criterion during DT processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, it is still unknown whether the dlPFC is also recruited for rather voluntary order control processes, which are required in situations that allow for intentional and internally generated order choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, in two experiments, we applied anodal (Experiment 1) and cathodal (Experiment 2) transcranial direct current stimulation during a random-order DT in which participants could freely decide about their order of task processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our results, we found facilitatory and inhibitory effects on voluntary task-order coordination because of anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was indicated by shorter RTs when participants intentionally switched the task order relative to the preceding trial during anodal as well as a reduced tendency to switch the task order relative to the preceding trial during cathodal stimulation compared with the sham stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings indicate that the dlPFC is also causally involved in voluntary task-order coordination processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we argue that the dlPFC is recruited for intentionally updating and implementing task-order information that is necessary for scheduling the processing of two temporally overlapping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:58:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE93VXJieG9WNG9zZHRXNWY1WVozaUgxa0lPOHNxNkE0Yjc5SzRTbVpwdXg1SnBIMUY5WDAtamlyTTQxMGdDa29GU2l3ck9DeDdwcVBHSS1GRU1Fc2JhenhDYTlQYmlUUERmbjZnaGxoNmxpZlhVTmJIanpYRVB5dlk</guid></item><item><title>触摸处理在自闭症中的不同之处及其重要性-神经科学新闻 | How Touch Processing Differs in Autism and Why It Matters - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTFBpNks0YnlIbzNodWNjWU1DV2JYWjRZR0dob0N5U3JxZlpMMGRQTnlhYm5XVy1IV1hnb3duMUV0eTR3czQwM3Q2Z2xPc004M0FoaVdkM2F4QU1TTXlLWFZGLXNoWDYwakFuZUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that adults with autism process active and passive touch similarly, unlike neurotypical individuals whose brains reduce activity during self-initiated touch. This finding may help explain repetitive behaviors like stimming, which are common in autism and can serve as emotional regulation or sensory coping mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG, virtual reality, and vibrotactile input, researchers created a realistic experimental setup to simulate touch and track brain responses. The study opens the door to understanding how sensory input impacts behavior and could inform future interventions to reduce harmful self-stimulation in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Perception Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; Adults with autism showed similar brain responses to both active and passive touch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensory Prediction Deficit:&lt;/strong&gt; This may indicate difficulty in predicting sensory outcomes, which could underlie stimming behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Method:&lt;/strong&gt; The study combined EEG, virtual reality, and tactile simulation for realistic and rigorous sensory testing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tapping a pen, shaking a leg, twirling hair—we have all been in a classroom, meeting, or a public place where we find ourselves or someone else engaging in repetitive behavior—a type of self-stimulatory movement also known as stimming. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with autism, stimming can include movements like flicking fingers or rocking back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108762"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child touching a wall." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/ASD-tactile-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To measure active touch, participants reached out to touch a virtual hand, giving them control over when they would feel the vibrations. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These actions are believed to be used to deal with overwhelming sensory environments, regulate emotions, or express joy, but stimming is not well understood. And while the behaviors are mostly harmless and, in some instances, beneficial, stimming can also escalate and cause serious injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is a difficult behavior to study, especially when the behaviors involve self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more we learn about how benign active tactile sensations like stimming are processed, the closer we will be to understanding self-injurious behavior,” said Emily Isenstein, PhD (’24), Medical Scientist Training Program trainee at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, and first author of the study in &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt; that provides new clues into how people with autism process touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By better understanding how the brain processes different types of touch, we hope to someday work toward more healthy outlets of expression to avoid self-injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used several technological methods to create a more realistic sensory experience for active touch—reaching and touching—and passive touch—being touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A virtual reality headset simulated visual movement, while a vibrating finger clip—or vibrotactile disc—replicated touch. Using EEG, researchers measured the brain responses of 30 neurotypical adults and 29 adults with autism as they participated in active and passive touch tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure active touch, participants reached out to touch a virtual hand, giving them control over when they would feel the vibrations. To measure passive touch, a virtual hand reached out to touch them. The participant felt vibrations when the two hands “touched,” simulating physical contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the researchers found that the neurotypical group had a smaller response in a brain signal to active touch when compared to passive touch, evidence that the brain does not use as many resources when it controls touch and knows what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the group with autism showed little variation in brain response to the two types of touch. Both were more in line with the neurotypical group’s brain response to passive touch, suggesting that in autism, the brain may have trouble distinguishing between active and passive inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could be a clue that people with autism may have difficulty predicting the consequences of their actions, which could be what leads to repetitive behavior or stimming,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a surprising finding, particularly in adults. John Foxe, PhD, director of the Golisano Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Institute at the University of Rochester and co-senior author of the study, remarked that this may indicate the difference in children with autism could be greater than their neurotypical counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many adults with autism have learned how to interact effectively with their environment, so the fact that we’re still finding differences in brain processing for active touch leads me to think this response may be more severe in kids, and that’s what we also need to understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, Location, Location: Student Pools University Resources to Advance Autism Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went into my PhD with the idea to have one big project that would use resources and expertise from both labs,” said Isenstein, who was co-mentored by Foxe and Duje Tadin, PhD, professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and co-senior author on the &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew pretty early on that I wanted to study something that would help us understand stimming, but it’s a pretty complicated concept. Everyone has been incredibly supportive of me building my ‘dream team’ of collaborations to make this experiment possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isenstein employed the expertise in EEG and touch from the Frederick J. and Marion A. Schindler Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab for her study. While the means to study proprioception—or sense of self-movement—and virtual reality came from the Tadin Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans are not stationary creatures, and things that happen when you are sitting still getting an EEG do not really mimic how you interact with things in real life,” said Isenstein. “It [virtual reality] was a really exciting way to study proprioception and body movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was easy to see the importance of the project Emily proposed. It was also clear how difficult it would be to conduct a rigorous EEG study of active and passive touch in autism,” said Tadin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Emily achieved this goal by spearheading the first collaboration between John’s lab and mine, leveraging the resources and expertise from the Medical Center and the University, including the Mary Ann Mavrinac Studio X. This is a wonderful example of the boundless possibilities in Rochester for a motivated student who takes advantage of the robust research resources that are available here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using EEG, vibrotactile inputs, and virtual reality in research is not novel, but creating a study where the three technologies work in tandem, is a newer approach. Isenstein also turned to the Mary Ann Mavrinac Studio X at the University of Rochester to brainstorm how to get these technologies to work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio X is an extended reality hub on campus that offers workshops, equipment rentals, and provides a multidisciplinary space for researchers and creators to collaborate on projects. “It really is an incredible resource for researchers trying to incorporate virtual reality into their research,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setup went through several trial periods to figure out how to do it without compromising data quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really exciting when I could finally get to the point to use these technologies together,” said Isenstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We ended up mounting the VR headset onto a frame that people could just lean into and then their hands were free to move around and do whatever. And their head was still very stationary. This setup allowed the team to simulate a realistic sensory environment without compromising on data quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers aim to apply these methods to more complex movements in people with autism to understand stimming better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Ed Freedman, PhD, Grace Rico, and Zakilya Brown of the University of Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported by the Schmitt Program in Integrative Neuroscience (SPIN) through the Del Monte Institute for Neuroscience pilot program, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Eye Institute, the National Institute on Aging, and the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this tactile processing and ASD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bdf6d8d1ced4d8e2eed0d4c9d590f5dcc4d9c8d6fdc8cfd0de93cfd2ded5d8cec9d8cf93d8d9c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kelsie Smith Hayduk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://rochester.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Rochester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Kelsie Smith Hayduk – University of Rochester&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2025.121215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Adults on the autism spectrum differ from neurotypical peers when self-generating but not passively-experiencing somatosensation: a high-density electrophysiological (EEG) mapping and virtual reality study&lt;/a&gt;” by Emily Isenstein et al. &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adults on the autism spectrum differ from neurotypical peers when self-generating but not passively-experiencing somatosensation: a high-density electrophysiological (EEG) mapping and virtual reality study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little is known about how different features of tactile inputs affect somatosensory perception in autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study we combined high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and virtual reality (VR) to assess how the volition and pattern consistency of somatosensory stimulation influenced the electrophysiological responses in neurotypical (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 30) and autistic (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 30) adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we compared N1 and P300 amplitudes when vibrotactile stimulation were actively triggered by self-motion (Active) versus passively triggered by target-motion (Passive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also measured the mismatch negativity (MMN) to assess how deviations in the pattern of stimulus duration affected the electrophysiological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed comparable responses regardless of pattern deviation in the MMN time window between groups, but different patterns of amplitude in this time frame based on whether the stimulation was Active or Passive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the autism group we observed smaller N1 amplitudes in response to Passive, but not Active, vibrations as compared to the control group. Conversely, there were overall larger magnitude P300 amplitudes in the autism group, but comparable levels of Passive-to-Active attenuation between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the autism cohort demonstrated variation from the neurotypical cohort with respect to the volition of the stimuli, but there were comparable results between groups in response to pattern deviation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that there are subtle differences in how adults with and without autism handle self-generated and externally-generated somatosensory sensations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFBpNks0YnlIbzNodWNjWU1DV2JYWjRZR0dob0N5U3JxZlpMMGRQTnlhYm5XVy1IV1hnb3duMUV0eTR3czQwM3Q2Z2xPc004M0FoaVdkM2F4QU1TTXlLWFZGLXNoWDYwakFuZUE</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员调查在华盛顿特区餐厅用餐的麻疹患者- WTOP | Health officials investigating person with measles who ate at DC restaurant - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQN0FscFlfVEJZM2lhTUJVak5MaFRDNzB3emJSa2YxT0JMdFdYRDgyeVc5VWkwODdpVjh0clhzbnpSQ1BDSW1HMGU5SUtlZWVseVNUV205MlhLbk5hZS03aHlyRHMzOC1JLS1HUjJlQ1BkcENyLVZhYjBhd0ZTLVcyRnlkeUZXZ203MXZYTDByME00ZUdFUjc4Y0Yxam1wRUZWUkktZ2p2bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;Anyone who was at the Five Guys restaurant at 1400 I Street NW on Saturday, April 5 between 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. may have been exposed to the measles virus, according to D.C.

                &lt;p&gt;The D.C. Department of Health says a person with a confirmed measles diagnosis ate at a local restaurant in early April. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Five Guys restaurant at 1400 I Street NW on Saturday, April 5 between 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. may have been exposed to the measles virus, according to D.C. Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles develop in two stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The first stage begins seven to 14 days after exposure and often presents with a fever over 101 degrees along with a runny nose, red, watery eyes, and a cough. The second stage occurs three to five days after the initial symptoms start and consists of a rash on the face that gradually spreads to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;D.C. Health says a person with measles is contagious from four days before the rash appears until four days after it emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who were possibly exposed to measles and are not immune should contact their healthcare provider or D.C. Health at 844-493-2652 for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with symptoms should immediately isolate and stay away from others, then call a healthcare provider. D.C. Health says that anyone with symptoms should call ahead before going to a healthcare provider’s office or the emergency room to notify them of any exposure to measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second known case of measles in D.C. this year. D.C. Health &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/local/2025/03/dc-health-officials-confirmed-measles-case-in-the-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed a positive case of measles in late March&lt;/a&gt; in a person who rode on an Amtrak train to Union Station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. counties with the most egregious &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5164926-contaminants-american-tap-water-research/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5164926-contaminants-american-tap-water-research/"&gt;water quality violations&lt;/a&gt; are concentrated in four states: West Virginia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Oklahoma, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Standing out among the top-10 such regions was Wyoming County, W. Va., whose public water utility boasted the highest number of infringements in a single water system, according to the study, published Tuesday in international journal &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.70012"&gt;Risk Analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;About 2 million people nationwide — equivalent to Nebraska’s entire population — do not have running water, and this lack of basic drinking water services tends to occur in clusters, the study authors determined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This high number is neither equally nor proportionally distributed across the population,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With another 30 million people reliant on &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4685181-pfas-forever-chemicals-water-systems-rate-hikes-filtration-epa-rule/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4685181-pfas-forever-chemicals-water-systems-rate-hikes-filtration-epa-rule/"&gt;drinking water systems&lt;/a&gt; that violate safety rules, the researchers sought to determine what types of systems are most prone to these deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many experts have proposed water privatization — the transfer of public water systems to the ownership or management of private companies — as a potential solution to making U.S. water cleaner and safer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet at the same time, the authors explained, opponents have argued that such a switch could cause companies to prioritize profits over public needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers therefore decided to investigative how the implementation of private versus public system operations impacts &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5236857-epa-review-fluoride-health-impacts-drinking-water/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/"&gt;water quality&lt;/a&gt; and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;To do so, they mapped out the country’s distribution of system ownership, violations, water injustice and perceptions of water access among residents. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the violations included in the research were failures to abide by regulations under the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5190822-epa-signals-it-could-narrow-clean-water-act-protections/"&gt;Safe Drinking Water Act&lt;/a&gt;, such as exceedances of maximum contaminant levels, non-compliance with required water treatment protocols and the absence of monitoring schedules or communication to customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that privatization alone is not a solution,” lead author Alex Segrè Cohen, an assistant professor of science and risk communication at the University of Oregon, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-596708068" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“The local context, such as regulatory enforcement, community vulnerability, and community priorities, matters in determining outcomes,” Segrè Cohen added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The highest-ranking counties that exhibited water injustice issues were in Mississippi — home to eight out of top 10 such spots — as well as South Dakota and Texas, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers defined water injustice as “the unequal access to safe and clean drinking water that disproportionately impacts low-income households and people of color.” They thereby formulated a county-level score based on a combination of water system performance and community social vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Water injustice hotspots were more often situated in regions with lower private system ownership and stronger public system presence — suggesting that public systems are not necessarily superior at curbing violations, the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data also showed that residing in a county that has both increased water injustice and a higher proportion of privatized systems was linked to a stronger perception of vulnerability around water access and security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the authors expressed hope that lawmakers and regulators would be able to utilize the research to inform their water management strategies and narrow down their areas of focus.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Policymakers can use our findings to identify and prioritize enforcement efforts in hotspots, make improvements in infrastructure and implement policies that ensure affordable and safe drinking water — particularly for socially vulnerable communities,” Segrè Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;

People often assume that it must be safe if something grows in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/5/875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; points to a more complicated picture. Concerns have risen over the potentially harmful effects of long-term folk herb consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Noura Abou Zeinab, an assistant professor at &lt;a href="http://www.bau.edu.lb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Beirut Arab University&lt;/a&gt;, has led an investigation into some of these concerns. She explored how certain frequently consumed plants might impact liver and kidney health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-herbs-under-suspicion"&gt;Herbs under suspicion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Historically, medications have been primarily sourced from plants. Due to their high therapeutic potential and ability to improve well-being, which has improved quality of life since ancient times, herbal drugs are widely accepted by the general population,” noted the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various communities in the Middle East have long relied on homegrown solutions for digestive complaints and overall vitality. Some of these plants are now under the microscope because they may carry unknown risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/herbal-supplements-often-contain-hidden-ingredients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herbs&lt;/a&gt; that are known among locals are rarely tested for prolonged use. Investigators discovered that certain extracts could affect internal organs in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-long-term-use-of-herbal-remedies"&gt;Long-term use of herbal remedies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted experiments on adult male rats. Tissue studies and &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/ncds/ncd-surveillance/steps/part3-section6.pdf?sfvrsn=73a06c16_2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biochemical measurements&lt;/a&gt; offered fresh insights into how these plant extracts might alter body function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight a real need for caution when using these plants for extended periods. Although these herbs have a long history of traditional use, their potential adverse effects should not be overlooked,” said Dr. Noura Abou Zeinab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-perspectives-on-health"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;New perspectives on health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people turn to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/traditional-complementary-and-integrative-medicine#tab=tab_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;traditional medicine&lt;/a&gt; to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/synthetic-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;synthetic drugs&lt;/a&gt;. They might assume that a leaf or root with a long lineage of human use is free of undesirable effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts caution that some herbal remedies contain potent chemicals that burden the liver and kidneys. Regulators continue to stress the importance of quality control to avoid contaminated or adulterated products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experts-are-cautious"&gt;Experts are cautious&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on herbal toxicity remain relatively scarce in comparison to pharmaceutical research. That gap in data means individuals might be tempted to assume safety without scientific proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators in different parts of the world have raised questions about the daily consumption of certain teas, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chia-seeds-have-great-potential-to-improve-human-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;, or extracts. There is also concern that people may self-prescribe herbs at higher doses than recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-conflict-between-herbs-and-modern-drugs"&gt;Conflict between herbs and modern drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists and healthcare practitioners often advise people to inform their doctors about the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/herbal-supplements-are-not-always-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herbal supplements&lt;/a&gt; that they regularly consume. Even mild interactions could pose problems, especially for those on prescription medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assessing the potential synergy or conflict between herbs and modern drugs is an ongoing challenge. Experts emphasize that patients should report all substances to their doctor, whether natural or synthetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-finding-balance-with-herbal-remedies"&gt;Finding balance with herbal remedies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals argue that centuries of usage point to inherent safety. Others believe that scientific validation is necessary for each claim, no matter how time-honored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study encourages a cautious stance toward daily reliance on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/wild-plant-extracts-can-block-covid-19-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant extracts&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to health choices, knowledge can reduce unfortunate outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-potential-paths-forward"&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Potential paths forward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future trials may explore whether moderate dosages or different preparations of these herbs could lessen any strain on the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/traffic-related-air-pollution-causes-liver-damage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;liver&lt;/a&gt; and kidneys. A better grasp of chemical composition might also pave the way for safer herbal solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public outreach campaigns could inform consumers about the possible downsides of unsupervised herbal remedies. This might involve educational programs that outline risks and emphasize expert guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-fine-print-on-herbal-products"&gt;The fine print on herbal products&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labels on herbs often lack comprehensive warnings. More detailed descriptions would help users make better choices before trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies that process or market these items might consider investing in toxicity research. A product with thorough safety data will gain trust more easily than one without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tradition-and-science"&gt;Tradition and science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every generation refines its approach to well-being. By blending traditional knowledge with scientific scrutiny, society can benefit from the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decisions about herbal remedies should always involve careful thought and consultation. These concerns highlight why further research remains vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/5/875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 12:45:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9qQ1VGTWRhWTRZczd2THY5QVlYU1F6bUNPNE1pN2lmQTlpVlV2SW9neXY2NWUxWWt4b0Zqd0dRdVRKU3VVTmtEOUZyam1YOWhSY3JBVGNveGlWb0ZWVGlkWkl2WlVlYmVrM3dSV1FBdnRrbFRiSElR</guid></item><item><title>饮用这种果汁可以减少40%的肠道炎症- SciTechDaily | Drinking This Fruit Juice May Cut Gut Inflammation by 40% - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNWmlJUVR5NDFSWlVSTTJidWJwR04tZzFUNjNJcDZVWjJQVklMaFBMUWVhSkI5U2x1YkJ5MTQxb0ljOTBUR1lHUXNrdzltM1BCbUVZazZ5UEtTN2lhWS1vRzdVamVMdlpiMFhUMklIS3g4akdFR3Y4czl4NWJiUzBVVWh2QnRfOTBiN2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 12:35:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNWmlJUVR5NDFSWlVSTTJidWJwR04tZzFUNjNJcDZVWjJQVklMaFBMUWVhSkI5U2x1YkJ5MTQxb0ljOTBUR1lHUXNrdzltM1BCbUVZazZ5UEtTN2lhWS1vRzdVamVMdlpiMFhUMklIS3g4akdFR3Y4czl4NWJiUzBVVWh2QnRfOTBiN2c</guid></item><item><title>老年人可能不需要如此密切地观察血糖- San Diego Union-Tribune | Older people may not need to watch blood sugar so closely - San Diego Union-Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOT2QxeGt5V3hyd1NPOWVpQkN4XzR5enZEeUVwSllZQTBZbnlteWNFMnMxd2dzTm5QSjlMLTNWWHhlbDBHLTJBZTNKREd3QXRtUDMxZjNPZHMxdzQtVC1rRVlueElFVUxiaEJiLWQzSUhOUmlsSlQwemhsTTBmR1pjQ3lWRkZBdVp3VTFxUmxpa2ZHZml5eldzZ2JHMzhDOFBNQnYtRVp4SXBnQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Paula Span&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, Ora Larson recognizes what’s happening. “It feels like you’re shaking inside,” she said. “I’m speeded up. I’m anxious.” If someone asks whether she would like a salad for lunch, she doesn’t know how to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has had several such episodes this year, and they seem to be coming more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She stares and gets a gray color and then she gets confused,” her daughter, Susan Larson, 61, said. “It’s really scary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoglycemia occurs when levels of blood sugar, or glucose, fall too low; a reading below 70 milligrams per deciliter is an accepted definition. It can afflict anyone using glucose-lowering medications to control the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it occurs more frequently at advanced ages. “If you’ve been a diabetic for years, it’s likely you’ve experienced an episode,” said Dr. Sei Lee, a geriatrician at the University of California San Francisco, who researches diabetes in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ora Larson, 85, has had Type 2 diabetes for decades. Now her endocrinologist and her primary care doctor worry that hypoglycemia may cause falls, broken bones, heart arrhythmias and cognitive damage.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Both have advised her to let her hemoglobin A1c, a measure of average blood glucose over several months, rise past 7%. “They say, ‘Don’t worry too much about the highs — we want to prevent the lows,’” Susan Larson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her mother has spent 35 years working to maintain an A1c below 7% — a common recommendation, the goal people sing and dance about in pharma commercials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She faithfully injects her prescribed drug, Victoza, about three times a week and watches her diet. She’s the oldest member of the Aqua for Arthritis class at a local pool in St. Paul, Minn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when her doctors recommended a higher A1c, she resisted. “I think it’s a bunch of hooey,” she said. “It didn’t make sense to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She got a lot of encouragement and recognition from her physicians for controlling her diabetes, staying on top of it,” her daughter explained. “They always praised her ‘tight control.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For someone who’s been so compliant all these years, it’s like they changed the rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Revised recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, the &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.12514"&gt;American Geriatrics Society called for a hemoglobin A1c of 7.5% to 8% for most older adults&lt;/a&gt; with diabetes, and 8% to 9% for those contending with multiple chronic illnesses and limited life expectancy. (Ora Larson has multiple sclerosis and hypertension.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other medical societies and advocacy groups, including the &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S128/157561/6-Glycemic-Goals-and-Hypoglycemia-Standards-of"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/5/1520/5413486"&gt;Endocrine Society&lt;/a&gt;, have also revised their guidelines upward for older patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relaxing aggressive treatment can involve stopping a drug, lowering a dose or switching to another medication — an approach called de-intensification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of effective new diabetes drugs — GLP-1 receptor agonists (like Ozempic) and SGLT2 inhibitors (like Jardiance) — has further altered the landscape. Some patients can substitute these safer medications for risky older ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the new drugs can also complicate decisions, because not all older patients can switch — and for those who can, insurance companies may balk at the new medications’ high price tags and deny coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So de-intensification is proceeding, but &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(23)00215-6/fulltext"&gt;too gradually&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2021 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785666"&gt;study of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, looked at patients who had gone to an emergency room or been hospitalized because of hypoglycemia. Fewer than half had their medication regimens de-intensified within 100 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35318647/"&gt;Nursing home residents&lt;/a&gt; are the ones that get into trouble,” said Dr. Joseph Ouslander, a geriatrician at Florida Atlantic University and the editor-in-chief of The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 2021 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2777044"&gt;study, of Ontario nursing homes&lt;/a&gt;, found that more than half of residents taking drugs for Type 2 diabetes had A1c levels below 7%. Those with the greatest cognitive impairment were being treated most aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ouslander has calculated, based on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24615164/"&gt;a national study&lt;/a&gt;, that roughly 40,000 emergency room visits annually resulted from overtreatment of diabetes in older adults from 2007 to 2011. He &lt;a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgs.19201"&gt;thinks the numbers are likely to be much higher now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The complex side of control&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief primer: Diabetes can cause such grievous complications — heart attacks, stroke, vision and hearing loss, chronic kidney disease, amputations — that so-called strict glycemic control makes sense in young adulthood and middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But tight control, like every medical treatment, involves a period of time before paying off in improved health. With diabetes, it’s a long time, probably eight to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older people already contending with a variety of health problems may not live long enough to benefit from tight control any longer. “It was really important when you were 50,” Lee said. “Now, it’s less important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older diabetics don’t always welcome this news. “I thought they’d be happy,” Lee said, but they push back. “It’s almost like I’m trying to take something away from them,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk that tight control will also set off hypoglycemia increases as patients age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoglycemia can make people sweaty, panicky, fatigued. When hypoglycemia is severe, “people can lose consciousness,” said Dr. Scott Pilla, an internist and diabetes researcher at Johns Hopkins. “They can become confused. If they’re driving, they could have an accident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even milder hypoglycemic events “can become a qualify-of-life issue if they’re happening frequently,” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10169988/"&gt;causing anxiety&lt;/a&gt; in patients and possibly leading them to limit their activities, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts point to two kinds of older drugs particularly implicated in hypoglycemia: insulin and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513225/"&gt;sulfonylureas&lt;/a&gt; like glyburide, glipizide and glimepiride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people with Type 1 diabetes, whose bodies cannot produce insulin, injections of the hormone remain essential. But the medication is “widely recognized as a dangerous drug” because of its hypoglycemia risk and should be carefully monitored, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sulfonylureas, he added, “are becoming less and less used” because, while less risky than insulin, they also cause hypoglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great majority of older adults with diabetes have Type 2, which gives them more options. They can supplement the commonly prescribed drug metformin with the newer GLP-1 and SGLT2 drugs, which also have cardiac and kidney benefits. If necessary, they can add insulin to their regimens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Added concerns&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the new drugs’ more popular consequences, however, is weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For older people, if they’re frail and not very active, we don’t want them losing weight,” Pilla pointed out. And both metformin and the GLP-1 and SGLT-2 medications can have gastrointestinal or genitourinary side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 15 years, Dan Marsh, 69, an accountant in Media, Pa., has treated his Type 2 diabetes by injecting two forms of insulin daily. When he takes too much, he said, he wakes up at night with “the damn lows,” and needs to eat and take glucose tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet his A1c remains high, and last year doctors amputated part of a toe. Because he takes many other medications for a variety of conditions, he and his doctor have decided not to try different diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know there’s other stuff, but we haven’t gone that way,” Marsh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the new options, including continuous glucose monitors, “figuring out the optimal treatment is becoming more and more difficult,” Pilla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, though, “older people overestimate the benefit of blood-sugar lowering and underestimate the risk of their medications,” he said. Often, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36800554/"&gt;their doctors haven’t explained how the trade-offs shift with older age&lt;/a&gt; and accumulating health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ora Larson, who carries chewable glucose tablets with her in case of hypoglycemia (fruit juice and candy bars are also popular antidotes), intends to talk over her diabetes treatment with her doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good idea. “The biggest risk factor for severe hypoglycemia is having had hypoglycemia before,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you have one episode, it should be thought of as a warning signal. It’s incumbent on your doctor to figure out, Why did this happen? What can we do so your blood sugar doesn’t go dangerously low?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; study says that CT scans could account for 1 in 20 &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cancer/t-64554675"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases diagnosed each year if current overuse doesn't change.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;CT scans are an essential tool used to diagnose a range of medical conditions, but ionizing radiation exposure occurs as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stringent use of CT scanning could help mitigate risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;US researchers are warning of the potential risks from CT scans, a standard method used to create detailed images of the body for diagnosing diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computed tomography (CT or CAT) scans use X-rays to create a three-dimensional image of a patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scanner looks like a large tube. A patient lying on a table is moved inside the scanner, and X-ray instruments inside the machine are used to take hundreds of pictures of their body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method is different than magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, although the tube-like equipment used to scan the patient is similar. MRI scanners instead use powerful magnets to send radio waves through the body to create images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both enable &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/radiology-a-look-inside-the-body/a-19563080"&gt;highly detailed pictures of the human body&lt;/a&gt; to be produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, exposure to X-rays comes with risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"CT can save lives, but its potential harms are often overlooked," said Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist from University of California San Francisco, who was a lead researcher on the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why X-rays harm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electromagnetic spectrum is divided into radiation of different wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the center is the visible spectrum — the light that animals like us can perceive — including wavelengths that we see as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But electromagnetic waves also exist on either side of the visible spectrum. On one side is low-frequency, long-wavelength radiation. &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/no-cancer-danger-from-mobile-phones-research-concludes/a-70133650"&gt;This radiation includes radio waves&lt;/a&gt;, microwaves and infrared, and is less energetic than visible light. Radio waves are used by MRI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side is high-frequency, short-wavelength radiation that includes ultraviolet (UV), X-rays and gamma rays. These are more energetic than visible light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's this high-frequency radiation — known as "ionizing" radiation — that poses a health hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ionizing radiation can strip atoms of their electrons. That means it has enough energy to damage tissue at the molecular level. In humans, this damage can lead to a range of issues, including cancer. UV is commonly known as a health risk due to sun exposure, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While X-rays are high-energy forms of radiation, they are also an essential tool for providing &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/medicine/t-71742676"&gt;medical professionals&lt;/a&gt; with vital insights into patient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-vendor-cmp-id="c44391" data-lang-code="en" data-id="68339716" class="embed dw-widget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1 in 20 cancers could one day be traced to CT scan use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model estimated that about 103,000 cancer diagnoses could result from CT exposure over the lifetime of the patients studied. That equates to about 5% of the total number of new cases annually in the US, assuming no change to the rate of CT use and cancer findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CT scans are being used more and more frequently as a diagnostic tool — up about 30% since 2007. Scan frequency also increases with age, with those age 60 to 69 having more than other groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis also found CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis were more likely to result in cancers among adults, while head scans were the greatest risk for children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Children who underwent CT scans before their first birthdays were at 10 times greater risk of developing cancer than any other age group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our estimates put CT on par with other significant risk factors, such as alcohol consumption and excess body weight," said Smith-Bindman. "Reducing the number of scans and reducing doses per scan would save lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CT scans have some risk, but benefits are valuable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data obtained in the study applies to US patients and the American medical system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith-Bindman pointed to the misuse of CT as a diagnostic tool, including unnecessary or excessive scanning, including those used for respiratory infections or headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also highlighted variations in radiation doses used to effectively perform the scan, saying some patients receive excessive amounts that are not clinically needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other professionals in the field agree that misuse of CT scans can pose risks to patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It is a well-established fact that high-energy radiation causes cancer," said Pradip Deb, a radiation safety expert at RMIT University, Australia, who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deb said while it's commonly understood that ionizing radiation like X-rays can damage DNA, and that increased exposure could exacerbate the severity of that damage, it's not clear how this would work for individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Not everyone who is exposed to radiation will get cancer," Deb said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are risks associated with radiation exposure, CT scans remain invaluable for diagnosing health problems that — when addressed —  could improve quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The estimated risk [of exposure] sometimes can cause panic among the patients who are benefiting from radiation," Deb said. "Radiations are routinely used for diagnosis and treatment of cancer. This study has clearly established the importance of limiting the radiation dose where possible and of avoiding unnecessary CT scans if other low-radiation or no-radiation procedures can do the same job."&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top doctor has revealed a life-changing hack that could provide instant relief to the millions of people kept up at night by restless leg symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14591519/Doctor-technique-beat-overthinking-insomnia-infinity-tracing.html"&gt;Dr Joe Whittington&lt;/a&gt;, a US-based emergency room medic, tying socks around the feet could help calm overactive nerves that drive the problem.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an Instagram post that has been viewed more than 120,000 times, Dr Joe—who revealed he suffers from restless legs himself—urged people to try the method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Tying a sock or wrap just below your toes might actually calm restless leg syndrome' and, there is 'real science' behind it, Dr Joe claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Known medically as Willis-Ekbom disease, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14482545/Restless-legs-causes-misery-unusual-cure-help-DR-SCURR.html"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which affects one in ten adults, is described by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-05452610-19dd-11f0-9959-415bc15f02d6" class=""&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; as an overwhelming urge to move the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients often report the symptoms being at their worst at night, in bed, when the body is relaxed—although it is not clear why, or what causes the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, it can also cause unpleasant crawling or creeping sensation in the feet, calves and thighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joe, who has 782,000 Instagram followers, demonstrated in the video how to tie the socks to provide long-lasting relief: 'Make it just snug enough to apply a little bit of pressure. Do this for both feet.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor added: 'This simple foot compression technique can significantly reduce restless leg syndrome symptoms by triggering pressure points that help relax overactive nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As someone who struggles with restless legs themselves, this technique has been by far the most effective thing for me and my symptoms'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it doesn't just work for him, he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A clinical study has been shown to decrease restless leg symptoms in 90 per cent of the people that tried it', he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Joe's intervention comes as patients were warned last month that the drugs used to treat restless leg symptoms could trigger an unexpected and bizarre sexual side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs—known as dopamine antagonists—interact with parts of the brain that control movement, helping to ease restless leg symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet, more that a dozen women have now claimed the drugs, such as ropinirole, saw them develop compulsive gambling and sex addictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 'unusual urge to gamble or increased sexual urges' is listed as a general side-effect in the patient information leaflets provided alongside the drug.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With women twice as likely to develop restless leg syndrome as men, Dr Joe stresses the benefits of the life-changing and 'drug free' hack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts also believe that exercising regularly, avoiding alcohol and caffeine late at night, and following a regular bedtime routine could help ease symptoms in mild cases of restless leg syndrome that are not linked to an underlying health condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-15T08:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Tuesday, April 15, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Repurposing a blood pressure drug may prevent vision loss in inherited blinding diseases&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
NIH studies in animals show reserpine protects retinal-neurons necessary for vision, especially in females. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New studies in rats suggest the drug reserpine, approved in 1955 for high blood pressure, might treat the blinding disease retinitis pigmentosa. No therapy exists for this rare inherited disease, which starts affecting vision from childhood. A report on the studies, conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), published today in &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of reserpine’s effectiveness may greatly speed therapeutics for retinitis pigmentosa and many other inherited retinal dystrophies, which can be caused by one of more than a thousand possible mutations affecting more than 100 genes. Reserpine’s neuroprotective effect is independent of any specific underlying gene mutation,” said the study’s lead investigator, Anand Swaroop, Ph.D., senior investigator at NIH’s National Eye Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inherited retinal dystrophies cause degeneration of the retina, the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye. Vision loss can be present at birth or develop later in early adulthood. Disease progression varies depending on the gene involved. Some genetic defects may be inherited as dominant, where a mutation in just one of the two copies of the gene (one each from the mother and father) is sufficient to cause vision loss. Other genetic defects are recessive, where both copies of a gene must carry a mutation to cause vision loss. Gene therapies to correct inherited retinal dystrophies are promising, but take a long time to develop, are gene specific, and are often quite expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings are the latest evidence that reserpine improves survival of photoreceptor cells, the light-detecting retinal neurons that die in retinitis pigmentosa and other retinal dystrophies. In 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/fda-approved-drug-shows-promise-lab-models-blinding-childhood-disease"&gt;the Swaroop Lab demonstrated reserpine’s potential for preventing vision loss from LCA10&lt;/a&gt;, a retinal dystrophy caused by mutations in the &lt;em&gt;CEP290&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its latest work, Swaroop’s team tested reserpine in a rat model of a dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa caused by a mutation in the visual pigment gene rhodopsin. This disease mutation is common in Irish Americans with retinitis pigmentosa. Compared to untreated rats, reserpine preserved the process by which photoreceptors convert light that enters the eye into electrical signals that are sent to the brain to produce vision, known as phototransduction, in retinal cells called rod photoreceptors. Rod photoreceptors enable low-light vision; cone photoreceptors enable color vision in bright light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, reserpine better protected rod photoreceptors in female rats compared to males. The scientists also observed significant preservation of cone photoreceptors in female rats compared to male rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can only speculate about these sex-specific differences. However, future research would benefit from teasing out these differences and understanding them to lay a foundation for personalized approaches to retinal disease therapy,” Swaroop said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swaroop’s lab is developing additional, and more potent reserpine-related drugs. The idea would be to use such options to treat late-onset or slowly progressing inherited retinal dystrophies or to simply stall vision loss in aggressive retinitis pigmentosa varieties until more effective treatments are developed that can reverse that vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reserpine is no longer used for treating high blood pressure because of its side effects. The required dosage for treating retinal degeneration, however, would be very low and directly delivered in the eye. Reserpine is a small molecule therapy, which makes it easy to deliver to target tissues in the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

            During a Cabinet meeting last week, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. downplayed what is now the second-worst measles outbreak in the US since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t002z336ocp4muj0r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has claimed repeatedly that measles cases have “plateaued,” despite contradictory data from his own federal agencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0030336o9b4jdn2j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On Friday, the health department in Texas – the center of the outbreak that now spans multiple states – reported 232 new cases over the past three weeks, 42% more than in the three weeks before that. New outbreaks have also been reported in &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/health/idepd/diseases-and-conditions-resource-page/measles/" target="_blank"&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://data.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/data/view/summary-of-infectious-diseases-in-ohio" target="_blank"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthy.arkansas.gov/article/second-case-of-measles-in-arkansas-identified-in-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0031336o8zixqh1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, there have been at least 735 cases in 24 states this year, according to CNN’s tally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0032336ogpw6axk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, many experts believe that the actual case count stands in the thousands.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0033336o5qnhep72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think any of us have full situational awareness of what’s going on with this outbreak,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “You can’t say something is flattening if you don’t actually know the denominator of cases or [have] an understanding you’re getting [the] full capture of the cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0034336ovgfv0pid@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some experts think the number of deaths alone indicates that cases are deeply undercounted. The measles fatality rate is typically up to 3 deaths per 1,000 cases. But three deaths have already been reported in the ongoing outbreak in — two children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico — even though the official outbreak case count stands at not quite 650 between Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9htsf2900003b6oyslzz5ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Underreporting could also be happening for a variety of reasons, and that makes it difficult to predict exactly how bad this outbreak will get and how long it will last, said Dr. Nina Masters, a senior research scientist at Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company, and a former epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0037336ok37d3l7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Better data would be helpful, Masters said, to help public health officials set expectations about how big an outbreak might get, to help public health departments figure out where to allocate resources and to better understand what might be affecting cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjirbw00013b6ocsavt3pk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak has mainly infected people who were not vaccinated or whose vaccine status is unknown. If a local agency knows who is unvaccinated, it could do more targeted outreach to help persuade them to get protected against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0039336ool4uktz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine works rapidly and has been shown to provide the best protection against measles, particularly when it’s given to people in affected areas quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003a336oooohimal@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During a measles outbreak at a migrant shelter in Chicago last year, Masters – then with the CDC – created a model to predict the size of the outbreak and another to determine what effect interventions would have.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003b336owx9yhzwq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In both of those models, the results were very non-subtle that mass vaccination is really the way to bring these outbreaks under control, and the days matter. If you delay by a week, that increases the size of the outbreak,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003c336okl42ehgc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without mass vaccinations in the affected community in Chicago, the model predicted, there would be 250 cases. But because vaccines were administered quickly, there were only 57.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003e336ov7dv7rlo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Dr. Mark S. Roberts was part of an effort to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31433482/" target="_blank"&gt;create a model&lt;/a&gt; that took into account Texas’ expected number of unvaccinated to predict what a measles outbreak there would look like.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjn5ie00063b6oeumfroyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Until recently, the prediction was eerily similar to the case count in the current outbreak,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;said Roberts, a distinguished professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management and director of the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjmpd900043b6ob9j33q3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, though, cases in some counties have even outpaced the prediction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003f336ow6tqbe92@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak, had 355 cases as of April 11, and the state health department says that number is expected to continue to rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003g336ongqdbfte@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If there had been an outbreak in Gaines County in 2018, Roberts’ model predicted 270 cases, 100 of whom would be “bystanders” — not children whose parents refused vaccination but those who couldn’t get vaccinated or for whom the vaccine hadn’t fully worked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjoumr00083b6owiuglwo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts and many other public health experts are frustrated by the deaths that have already taken place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003h336o7r286mu8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s freaking 2025, and a child has died of measles,” Roberts said. “It’s just not right. This is a disease that, 12 years ago, we basically had eradicated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003i336or9uy8pja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Models are helpful in an outbreak, but even with all the data in the world, Roberts knows, not everyone is going to listen to the message that the unvaccinated need protection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hjqicq000b3b6o6kp2ilqg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2019, he presented his model to the Texas Legislature. Lawmakers asked good questions and understood what he showed them, he said, but not a single law was passed to improve vaccination rates in Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003j336ox1uczg7u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The thing that’s really sad about this is that all of this was predictable and totally avoidable,” Roberts said. “It’s just really sad.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003l336ovj1sa3oh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases may be undercounted in the ongoing outbreak, Masters said, because people aren’t getting tested or because they may be staying away from hospitals. In the Mennonite community that has been the center of the outbreak in Texas, there is a great sense of self-reliance and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;a preference for home remedies&lt;/a&gt; over doctors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003m336ocdodl113@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it’s a little difficult to tease apart which element of the underreporting Is leaning in which direction,” Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003n336oidl2bi02@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another reason it’s been hard to get an accurate case count is because of massive federal funding cuts for public health. The CDC pulled back over &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/health-department-grant-cuts-cdc-hhs/index.html"&gt;$11 billion in grants&lt;/a&gt; allocated during the Covid-19 pandemic that state and local health departments had been using to respond to a variety of public health threats, including measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hj7zem00003b6ot7td7oe0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In New Mexico, where at least 58 cases&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have been reported, a pullback of federal funds meant the public health department had to terminate contracts for 20 temporary workers who were helping with the measles response by checking vaccination records.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003o336ot18uy78n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Phil Huang, Health and Human Services director in Dallas County, Texas, said that in addition to canceling dozens of vaccine clinics in school districts with low vaccination rates, he had to lay off 11 permanent staff and 10 temporary workers, including three who work in the labs used to detect measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003p336ojmta10rd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those are our numbers so far,” he said. “We are looking at perhaps a few further cuts in the near future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003q336ocz7b93zn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These cuts mean real numbers may become even more difficult to pin down.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003t336o0if7rl0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles, a highly contagious virus, behaves in an entirely predictable fashion, Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003u336o8tbu8q7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It behaves almost the same way in almost every setting,” she said. “If someone has measles, they go into a room with a bunch of people who are susceptible to measles, a lot of those people are going to get sick.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003v336ovttvnhan@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said last week that the US is a “model for the rest of the world” when it comes to managing measles, but the country is no longer as effective at preventing outbreaks because of decreasing vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003w336o22sgnyl5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Saying we’re better or no worse off than other countries, that’s misleading at best and kind of a whitewash of the significance of this measles outbreak,” said Dr. Bill Moss, a professor in epidemiology and executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003x336om2nvlago@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is true that, historically, the United States has done better than many other countries in the world,” he said. “That’s because we’ve had a strong immunization program.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003y336oamnvmvtb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles had been declared eliminated in the US in 2000 because the majority of people were vaccinated, but that number has been falling since the Covid-19 pandemic – even before a lawyer &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/12/politics/rfk-jrs-long-complicated-history-with-the-measles-vaccines/index.html"&gt;with a history&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine skepticism took over HHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t003z336ouxduzc5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, just 68.5% of kids in the US had their first dose of the MMR vaccine by 15 months of age, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/health/measles-vaccine-first-dose-decline/index.html"&gt;new report from Truveta&lt;/a&gt;. This is a significant decline from 2020, when more than 77% of kids got their first shot by this age. And it’s far short of the federal goal of 95% of children in kindergarten having had their second dose, the threshold needed to prevent measles outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hkbv9k0000336ovuwft52b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage of the MMR vaccine is particularly low in Gaines County, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year had not gotten the shot. Some other counties in the affected states also fall below the 95% benchmark, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hlhgj5001h3b6o47z2zjov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kansas, for example, only 90% of kindergartners have gotten their MMR vaccines. The Sublette Unified School District in the southwestern part of the state, where most of the state’s cases are concentrated, has a vaccination rate of just 44%, &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2016/Kindergarten-Immunization-Data" target="_blank"&gt;according to data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0040336oe5852e6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Working on Truveta’s report “set off real alarm bells for me,” Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0041336ot3e7m34a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current measles vaccination rates mean the country is no longer closing immunity gaps like it used to, “which is very concerning for the future of this outbreak,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2t0042336oswzwzolq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has said that people should get the MMR vaccine, but he has also said that doing so should be a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;personal choice.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hk4c5x00193b6o8bkg317s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With so much hesitancy in areas that have seen so many cases, experts say that here needs to be a clearer message from the top and that, as with a 2019 measles outbreak, many more people will need to be convinced that getting a vaccine is not just in their best interest, it is also in the best interest of the community.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiub2u0043336oiqhtihdb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important for people to know, not vaccinating your child doesn’t only put your child at risk, it puts other children at risk,” Roberts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9hiodqu002x336olcd7iuor@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

Two Mennonite residents, Helen and Helena, had conflicting views on the jabs. One said she vaccinated her children because it was the right thing to do, while the other said she didn't - believing infections like measles "make their immune system stronger".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Another resident, Joselyn said she doesn't want to vaccinate her children because she claims to know people who have suffered adverse reactions. Judy said her family have gone without the MMR vaccine because they "don't like the things in it". Of the 700 measles cases in the US, 541 have been recorded in Texas alone - and&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;70% of these cases are among children and young babies.&lt;strong class="Strong_strong__e2x35"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Measles is an infectious virus that weakens the immune system, leaving patients vulnerable to secondary infections like pneumonia. Those who are vaccinated have a significantly lower risk of falling ill, as the jab is 93% effective at preventing infections after one dose, and 97% effective after a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;Many in the Mennonite community however believe vaccinations should be a personal choice, even though they are not strictly forbidden in scripture. Around 3,000 people out of 22,000 in Gaines County follow the Mennonite faith, according to figures released in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Mirror</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 11:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9jcW55a0JpRXh1ZHBiRzBNRjJWTF9SWkxCSzRKb01WbEU1Q1JPZU41R0ItQ2JlQ2RWbVM3UDZxSjVHZEE1ak9mX0RoaUY0MjFtNC02bEk1OGZPMUhOZk95Y3ZWNUNCb1JzQVRzVkFEUTNONTlfcFRIWC00SU5vR2PSAYQBQVVfeXFMT3d5elF6bkdtVzRhSDRQTGlibjR4US1LSHU5YzdBaFU3RWQ4Q2xSU0lBSnJnTUktTWNuM1NkcGVfbUFwSkNKNGZiNERBMDYyTUozOUV0RnItSUc3NGVGRW0wQ215am5qZjhfYTlrSllsdFVkcTd3NDJKM2pzbXpVampKMFot</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员确认密歇根州另一例麻疹病例- ClickOnDetroit | Health officials confirm another case of measles in Michigan - ClickOnDetroit</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxObkpHNFVIaDRlVXlheTBfUm1uSTltMENvUEEyNVVIUklueTN2TTNhMVM0Zm92bDFtQzB6TTFFLTBNLU5sX2xWNHItS0pnTDBIX1l4YzlWbWtTMU1ac2hVRlMyRHJTeE55SE9RTHlMcGZDNE0zN0VfaXlGUHN3eWJRV1pnTlVSTTEtM1loUWtmUWZVS1l0UnJjbExHeDRSajM4N25GdkJkVlE1andLWldzYlR6cXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A new case of measles is confirmed in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;A baby girl in Ingham County got sick after traveling out of state.

It's particularly exciting that such a simple dietary addition could make a measurable difference to cognitive performance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that while memory recall performance after two hours was worse when people ate walnuts, after six hours, the finding was reversed and walnuts outperformed the control dish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to examine the immediate effect of walnuts on brain function for young adults throughout a single day, building on previous research that shows how regular nut consumption improves cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the benefits of a walnut-rich breakfast were evident in a younger population, researchers noted that it remains to be seen whether it would also benefit older people or clinical populations, such as those with cognitive impairment or metabolic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recordings of brain activity suggest that walnuts may help the brain work more efficiently during challenging mental tasks, while blood samples revealed positive changes in glucose and fatty acid levels, which can influence brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggested that walnuts have a special mix of &lt;a href="/topic/nutrients"&gt;nutrients&lt;/a&gt; - including omega-3 alpha linolenic fatty acids, &lt;a href="/topic/protein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, and plant compounds called polyphenols - that may improve how the brain performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers noted that more research was needed to fully understand how walnuts produce these beneficial effects on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQNmlLaTlDRDRJU1dzWmk5VjRFUWg0LXAzVkI2RHVVQmwwREd2VXlKVG80ZXc2REJYMFo1VHVTdlhCd002X3ljdjZSc1NTTWZfRFY3VHRDRk9oUml5eUdVYzNEdjlwMERjaFhSaDI0YjNmZzZkQVc5QW1RczZGTmlfdU9INXlrR3RfU3BzTVJIY0dGTS14bTdIUXZzWVpIS0FQLUhXOEhKdFE2QmJVSlplTlV0WXoxRTFLQmM0</guid></item><item><title>快速家庭健康测试：检查您的反应时间- BBC | Quick home health tests: Check your reaction times - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNWTBFZXpvREZUcVVuQzdpSF9zNUUtT0hobUVDZ0lnd2h0ZDE1dENsbGZBQmZXLVIwbVBwSmNXOXBHdjlRbTVmaDJsc0x4X3N5UllMbFVoMlBOZERzM2hSdjhza0dWVHlaNWxkWURpakdITmhVOUsxR2pxSE5HYlZxR0kwSmZmNnlwN255Wnd6ek5uUS1EWVJlUUhIRmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Quick home health tests: Check your reaction times&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b2mh.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A black-and-white photo of a hand holding a stopwatch (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;(Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;b id="your-reaction-times-can-reveal-a-surprising-amount-about-what's-going-on-inside-your-body,-from-your-brain-health-to-your-risk-of-an-early-death." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Your reaction times can reveal a surprising amount about what's going on inside your body, from your brain health to your risk of an early death.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Of the course of our lifetimes, our reaction times will slowly wane.

"But a decline in reaction times probably indicates an accumulation of age-related degradation. It's a marker which tells us a lot about the combined functioning of quite a lot of biological systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But how can you assess your reaction time in the comfort of your home?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Sit in a chair, resting your arm on a table so that your wrist is hanging off the edge, with your thumb and forefingers facing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Ask your partner to hold a ruler vertically, over your hand, with the "zero", where the numbers start, aligned with your thumb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• Without warning, your partner should drop the ruler, while you try to catch it as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;• The distance the ruler falls before being caught is an assessment of your reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Broadly speaking, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4207053/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;an excellent performance equates&lt;/a&gt; to catching the ruler at a distance less than 7.5cm, above average counts as 7.5-15.9cm, average is 15.9-20.4cm, while below average is anything over 20.4cm and poor is more than 28cm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b4s2.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A person's reaction times can be a reflection of both their cognitive and physical fitness (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;A person's reaction times can be a reflection of both their cognitive and physical fitness (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, according to Cox, a single reaction time measurement doesn't reveal all that much, as reaction speeds &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4280496/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;vary considerably&lt;/a&gt; from one person to another due to factors ranging from gender to genetics, physical fitness, lifestyle habits and even personality type. Cox notes that what is likely to be more important is how your reaction speed varies if you compare your performance on the same test over time – for example, at yearly intervals over the course of a decade - and whether it starts to noticeably decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As Cox points out, our ability to react &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/motor-reaction-time" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;relies on&lt;/a&gt; a network of interconnected sensory systems: how well we see, hear or even smell a given stimulus, how quickly our brain can process the information it's receiving from our eyes or ears and issue a signal in response, and finally how quickly our nerve fibres, muscles and tendons can enact what the brain is telling them to do. "All these pieces of the jigsaw can be affected by ageing, and not necessarily to the same extent in all people," says Cox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There are two components to a reaction to the ruler drop test – the brain's ability to make a quick assessment that it has been dropped, and the speed with which the body can act on the brain's instructions to catch it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Researchers &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9423772/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that the first component of this network which tends to break down, beginning in midlife, is our physical ability to act on the brain's signals. So, our brains might notice that the ruler has been let go within milliseconds – but it still takes a while for the body to catch up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;Pain recommends so-called dual task training such as walking while turning your head from side to side or balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the University of Colorado Boulder, biomedical professor Alaa Ahmed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/44/15/e1596232024.full.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that as we get older, our reaction times may depend more heavily on our overall bodily health than our brain. She says this may be because things like fast-twitch muscle fibres which enable our physical ability to respond quickly, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7493202" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;have waned&lt;/a&gt;, or because our mitochondria – the components within our cells which generate energy – &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0501559102" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;are working less well&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that we're less efficient at moving swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Making a faster movement is more costly to older adults, so they rely primarily on reacting faster," says Ahmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, if we stay relatively well, our brain and central nervous system can still function strongly into our latter years. According to Matthew Pain, a professor of biomechanics at Loughborough University in the UK, scientists have assessed this &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4208637/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;by measuring&lt;/a&gt; the "startle reflex" in the ankles of healthy elderly adults in response to a loud sound. The results showed their brain's ability to respond to the sound and send a "move" signal to the ankle tends to remain relatively intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The raw nervous system hardware in healthy elderly [people] is not that [much] worse," says Pain. "Purely based on the startle reflex, they could still react quickly enough to be disqualified at the Olympics for a false start. They wouldn't, however, be able to get out of the blocks very quickly." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l4b505.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Measuring your reaction times throughout your life can help to track changes in your brain and bodily health (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Measuring your reaction times throughout your life can help to track changes in your brain and bodily health (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;As well as the ruler test, reaction times can be assessed through simple computer games such as the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Human Benchmark Reaction Time Test&lt;/a&gt; which involves waiting for a red box to turn green and then clicking on it as quickly as possible. Sharp deteriorations in performance over time can reflect a combination of sensory systems breaking down, as well as a slowing of the brain's decision-making. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38424122/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;One study last year&lt;/a&gt; found that loss of visual sensitivity in seeing and responding to patterns can be one of the earliest signs of dementia, beginning more than a decade before symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"With age, the nerve fibres in the brain's white matter can start to communicate signals less efficiently, resulting in slower information processing," says Cox. "Once the decision has been made to react, the nerves that connect your brain to your muscles also need to be in good condition to transmit that message quickly, and these age too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;&lt;span id="improving-your-score" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kPypaC"&gt;&lt;b id="improving-your-score" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;Improving your score&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But there are things that we can all do to either slow or prevent this decline from happening. Pain recommends so-called dual task training, which involves simultaneous movement and cognitive training activities to tune both the brain and body. Examples include walking while turning your head from side to side, balancing on one leg while reciting the alphabet, or tossing a ball while verbally associating words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even things like such as participating in fitness classes via a TV screen or tablet can help with your reaction times. "This improves the ability to perceive [a stimulus] and respond with meaningful coordinated motions," says Pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cox says that many of the activities which are often linked with healthy ageing, such as continuing to play a sport into later life, learning a musical instrument in retirement or simply keeping engaged with intellectual pursuits such as board games can have knock-on benefits for our reaction times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Sports performance drills which require fast responses could &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://medicopublication.com/index.php/ijfmt/article/view/10758" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;boost reaction times&lt;/a&gt; by enhancing both brain and body," says Cox. "And there's some evidence that generally keeping more socio-intellectually engaged is related to slower cognitive ageing across aspects of complex thinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBC_Future" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;b id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kVRnKf"&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:06:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNWTBFZXpvREZUcVVuQzdpSF9zNUUtT0hobUVDZ0lnd2h0ZDE1dENsbGZBQmZXLVIwbVBwSmNXOXBHdjlRbTVmaDJsc0x4X3N5UllMbFVoMlBOZERzM2hSdjhza0dWVHlaNWxkWURpakdITmhVOUsxR2pxSE5HYlZxR0kwSmZmNnlwN255Wnd6ek5uUS1EWVJlUUhIRmc</guid></item><item><title>延误后， RFK Jr.领导下的第一次疫苗咨询会议即将开始- NPR | After delays, first vaccine advisory meeting under RFK Jr. set to start - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQdURuZ3FnRVdoaDNIcjRxOEktWjVlQm1tZndqQk44Mmdscjlfb0pMelFXNFdBX1k1Q1luRjVtbTRjZUN4ckpFSS1JdlI4dUpTWXBpYW9TOXNhT0RXUUhpNEZwNDJmWk1WMGEwTzNNQV8xV1l1Y2Rvdzk5QzlqU2Q0LUVuVTZsQkp6dF9VYkVpdzhSdUM3Zkl3eXFFR1dtNGNCZS1j?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                An advisory committee of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is set to meet Tuesday to discuss vaccines for RSV, COVID and others.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For the first time since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took charge of the Department of Health and Human Services, vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are meeting publicly to discuss the nation's vaccine policies. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A meeting of the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/20/nx-s1-5304233/cdc-vaccine-meeting-delayed" target="_blank"&gt;initially scheduled for February&lt;/a&gt; but was postponed, raising concerns among some scientists and those working in public health about political interference in vaccine policy. The two-day meeting starts Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The committee's advice shapes &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/15/nx-s1-5293507/cdc-rfk-vaccine-advice" target="_blank"&gt;access to and insurance coverage for vaccines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I'm reassured and very glad to see that it's happening," says &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/staff-member/claire-hannan/" target="_blank"&gt;Claire Hannan&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers. "It's important to have this ongoing review of data and science, looking at the evidence that goes into the vaccine schedule in an open forum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisory committee typically holds public meetings three times a year, which are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RR7Es9sdNpY" target="_blank"&gt;live streamed online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During this week's meeting, the committee's independent advisors will hear from CDC staff on a range of vaccines, including HPV, COVID and flu, and vote on recommendations for some of them such as RSV and the tropical mosquito-borne viral disease chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The current agenda is similar to the proposed agenda for February, though it omits a vote on influenza vaccines that was on that agenda.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When asked about the change, HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard responded on behalf of CDC: "ACIP agenda items are always subject to change depending on what the working groups have ready for consideration." She further clarified: "This was not the annual vote for the routine use of the influenza vaccine for the upcoming season."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The advisors are independent experts who volunteer to serve on the committee. &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, a law professor at UC San Francisco, says she expects them to remain independent and hold thoughtful, rigorous discussions as they usually do.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But she's concerned about the effects of political interference on CDC staff who help run these meetings, who "are in a much more vulnerable position after extensive layoffs," Reiss says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There have been deep cuts to CDC staff since President Trump took office, including some officials who would have participated or spoken in this week's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's had a chilling effect on those who are left.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'll be looking to see if they change the process in any way," Reiss says. For example she says she'll be watching for changes in how conflicts of interest are handled – &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5323771/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisers-conflicts-interest" target="_blank"&gt;a topic Kennedy has raised repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; – or whether they put time limits on discussions among committee members, Reiss says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Signs of political interference may be subtle, says Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist and data scientist who writes the newsletter "&lt;a href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/about" target="_blank"&gt;Your Local Epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt;." What it may take, she says, is "for those of us that have listened to hundreds of ACIP meetings to report back whether it is just business as usual or there's some sketch things beneath the surface."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccine advocates are concerned over potential shifts in policy and official stances that may reduce confidence in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I don't want to see go away is a very strong endorsement of the use of vaccines as preventive medicine," says Dr. Anthony Fiore, a former CDC official who worked closely with the vaccine advisory committee before retiring from the agency in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's concerned because Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/06/nx-s1-5218574/rfk-vaccines-anti-vaccine-infectious-disease" target="_blank"&gt;cast doubt on vaccine safety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;canceled funding&lt;/a&gt; for research into vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Up to this point, every HHS director and every CDC director has been very enthusiastic about vaccines as they save money and they're an excellent preventive tool," Fiore says. But if public confidence in vaccines gets undermined, vaccination levels could drop below the levels needed to reduce transmission and protect the population from disease, he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It was an opportunity to meet him and ask him a few questions. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIRED: Professor Ramakrishnan, the crucial question in your book is &lt;em&gt;why we die&lt;/em&gt;. But exactly what is death?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venki Ramakrishnan:&lt;/strong&gt; By death, we mean the irreversible loss of the ability to function as a coherent individual. It is the result of the failure of a critical system or apparatus, for example, heart, brain, lung, or kidney failure. In this sense there is an apparent paradox: When our organism, as a whole, is alive, millions of cells within us are constantly dying, and we do not even realize it. On the other hand, at the time of death, most of the cells in our bodies are still alive, and entire organs are still functioning and can be donated to people in need of transplantation. But at that point the body has lost the ability to function as a whole. In this sense, it is therefore important to distinguish between cell death and death of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of death and aging, you say in your most recent book that you “wanted to offer an objective look at our current understanding of the two phenomena.” What was the biggest surprise or most deeply held belief that you had to reconsider while writing and researching this work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;There have been several surprises, actually. One is that death, contrary to what one might think, is not programmed by our genes. Evolution does not care how long we live, but merely selects the ability to pass on our genes, a process known as “fitness” in evolutionary biology. Thus, the traits that are selected are those that help us survive childhood and reproduce. And it is these traits, later in life, that cause aging and decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Another curious finding was the fact that aging is not simply due to wear and tear on cells. Wear and tear happens constantly in all living things, yet different species have very different lifespans. Instead, lifespan is the result of a balance between the expenditure of resources needed to keep the organism functioning and repairing it and those needed to make it grow, mature, and keep it healthy until it reproduces and nurtures offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQM3laYm4wb2hqTmxrdS1scmx4cXVuMmNZUjVBMGxFOTZWdGExOUR5Ynk1UndkUUx1M2lfaVpsc1JFVmlkcG1fcFJnU2psaVd6aVhxRmxwemQwWWxWVlRaUlVVQTQ1c2FVWjRsQlA5SWFhQXRjcHVyM0xKRGItS21kTjhLSzBQZWhhbEdpYUJ3MVlRY3lQZVR0eVQyODY</guid></item><item><title>4个肠道治疗技巧来阻止气体和腹胀- CNET | 4 Gut Healing Hacks to Stop Gas &amp; Bloating - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPd3Z2TmlBWUw1WngzM1JZQlFrNVlqREduTElsa3pydzFsZkpjZU1lbHZtelNDX0E1YWVpZUtjVS1Vcnh3VTVqNmVDLVNuUGJ4Qno1MDBpWnJUTER3SGl6dHBiVGt6RFVXOThacFRkWVEwQlpHQ01pbVAxSE4yRWMxWDJ6OA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/probiotic-foods-naturally-boost-gut-health/" target="_self"&gt;Gut health&lt;/a&gt; has recently been a trending topic on social media, yet it's not new.

In fact, the trillions of microbes living in your gut, collectively known as the &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/microbiome/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, serve as your body's internal environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Consider your &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-microbiome#link={%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-microbiome%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22gut%20microbiome%22}" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; as "little pets living inside your intestinal tract," Cleveland Clinic microbiome expert Gail Cresci explains. These microbes help break down food, regulate inflammation, support immunity and even produce essential compounds like vitamins and hormones. This is why it's vital to understand your body's warning signs and be able to identify when something is not quite right. So to answer the big question of how to keep your gut healthy, read on for a couple of health hacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/experts-share-what-your-bowel-movements-say-about-your-health/" target="_self"&gt; Are Your Poops Regular? Experts Share What Your Bowel Movements Mean&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs of an unhealthy gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're bloated or you have lots of gas, you may have a disrupted composition and function of the gut microbiome," Cresci said, adding that the only way to know for sure is to have it &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/microbiome-testing" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;measured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs of an unhealthy gut may include vomiting or stomach upset, fatigue, trouble sleeping, food intolerance &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/gut-health#improving-gut-health" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;and other symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. Skin irritation or problems may be one particularly visible sign, as some research &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6048199/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;links skin issues like acne and psoriasis&lt;/a&gt; to the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into how it &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/hropen/article/2022/2/hoac015/6553029" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;impacts reproductive health&lt;/a&gt; and hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/the-abcs-of-apple-cider-vinegar-benefits-precautions-and-proper-dosage/" target="_self"&gt;The ABCs of Apple Cider Vinegar: Benefits, Precautions and Proper Dosage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Carol Yepes/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to help your gut &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to see a doctor to get to the root cause of your health concern and rule out other conditions. Making changes to your diet or routine that may improve your gut, and your overall health is a good first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to keep in mind that there's no exact standard for the perfectly healthy gut microbiome, Cresci said, since everyone's composition is so different. Bearing that in mind, here are four things you can do to help keep it on the right track. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Eat these gut-friendly foods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiome prefers foods we can't digest. This includes foods with a lot of fiber, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, seeds and nuts; foods we already know we should eat for their nutritional properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Cresci, foods to remove from your gut, or eat in lower amounts, include foods high in sugar and fat and low in fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are all associated with the consumption of a Western diet, which is also associated with a disrupted microbiome," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a gut-healthy diet, which not-so-coincidentally coincides with a &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/5-heart-healthy-foods-to-add-to-your-grocery-list-this-week/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, eating fermented foods can help replace the good microbes and their metabolites. Cresci lists yogurt, kombucha and kefir as examples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Make note of the medications you're taking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a well-known fact that taking antibiotics &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732679/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;disrupts, at least temporarily, the family of "good" bacteria&lt;/a&gt; thriving in your body. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/aaw/au_arent_always_the_answer_fs_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;common side effects&lt;/a&gt; of taking antibiotics include nausea, diarrhea and developing yeast infections. If you're prescribed an antibiotic or have recurring infections that have you taking antibiotics often, ask your doctor about what you can do to help minimize the disruption to your microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other medications that can disrupt our microbiomes, Cresci says, include those that alter the PH of the stomach and take away acid. Examples include proton pump inhibitors, aka PPIs, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists, or H2 blockers, which are used to reduce acid reflux symptoms and might be available over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By keeping track of the medications you're taking, you can help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms and (with sign-off from your doctor) take the appropriate steps or substitutions if gut health is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Find the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; probiotics or supplements &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to incorporating more yogurt or fermented foods into their diet, some people may &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/news/7-best-probiotics/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;seek a probiotic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in hopes of balancing their gut, as they're designed to &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/how-do-probiotics-improve-your-gut-health/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;mimic an intact microbiota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. If you're considering taking a supplement, including probiotics, Cresci told CNET it's important to know that probiotics are strain-specific, and "each strain has their own method of action." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some probiotics are designed to help people with antibiotic-induced diarrhea, but that won't work for a person taking it for bowel regularity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to take the one that has been studied for whatever it is your problem is," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unfortunately, keep in mind that probiotics will not completely override what you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have a bad diet, and you want to keep eating a bad diet but want to improve your microbiome, a probiotic isn't gonna help you," Cresci said. "You have to do the other part too." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains, fruits and vegetables are great food choices if you want to start healing your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;piotr_malczyk/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Move your body every day and prioritize sleep &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Get better sleep" or "exercise more" might sound like tired advice, but improving your sleep hygiene and &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/fitness/10-workouts-youre-probably-already-doing-every-day/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;squeezing in more physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are tried and true ways to improve your health, including your gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise may &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;help your gut in different ways&lt;/a&gt;, including by improving your circulation, helping your metabolism and aiding your digestive muscles, according to information from the Cleveland Clinic. If you dread running or don't have time to go to the gym, don't worry: There are &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/exercise-snacks-are-just-as-healthy-as-a-full-workout-heres-why/" target="_self"&gt;small ways&lt;/a&gt; you can get your body in the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/gut-health-workout" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;habit of moving every day&lt;/a&gt; or at least more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good sleep is another general piece of wellness advice tied directly to the health of our guts. According to Cresci, our microbiome adheres to the &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/sleep/internal-clock-out-of-whack-heres-how-to-reset-and-get-better-sleep/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; too. So if we're eating when our gut microbiome isn't ready, we won't be set up to properly process the nutrients of our food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking sleep also triggers an increase in stress and cortisol, which have &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;span&gt;negative mental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and physical impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot going on with the gut-brain interaction, so that signals back to the microbiome, and vice versa," Cresci said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most fundamental is the fact that when we're exhausted, we don't have the energy to check off many of the things that keep us healthy, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2021.637010/full#h11" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;including exercising&lt;/a&gt; or finding a nutritious meal -- both of which impact our gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're sleepy, tired, exhausted, you tend not to do the things we know are good for microbiomes," Cresci said. "So it kind of perpetuates itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq" class="c-shortcodeFaq g-container-rounded-small"&gt; &lt;div&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_sections" class="c-shortcodeFaq_sections"&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding fiber to your diet and drinking more water are easy first steps to a healthier gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion c-shortcodeFaq_question g-border-thin-light-top"&gt; &lt;div data-cy="shortcodeFaq_answer" class="c-shortcodeFaqQuestion_answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, probiotics like curd are good bacteria that assist with digestion and improve your microbiome and overall gut health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPd3Z2TmlBWUw1WngzM1JZQlFrNVlqREduTElsa3pydzFsZkpjZU1lbHZtelNDX0E1YWVpZUtjVS1Vcnh3VTVqNmVDLVNuUGJ4Qno1MDBpWnJUTER3SGl6dHBiVGt6RFVXOThacFRkWVEwQlpHQ01pbVAxSE4yRWMxWDJ6OA</guid></item><item><title>两分钟的运动可以降低高胆固醇的风险- Surrey Live | Two minute exercise can reduce risk of high cholesterol - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNekdXVEhYMk03S2o5X1ViMkZaVkxxZF9sODRtdmh4X09YUXpUbXAzNDZZdFFLTXdsMG1HT0FxMFJLRFQ2Y3l6TE5KY1pZbnZ4YU5aaV9ka3JsYXpoNlhqY1VLUEI1WTdBY0hyQmJ0cUk5NlNhS3liTENobmx3ZUNRNE13NkVHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going to the gym can feel overwhelming for a lot of us but there are some exercises you can do in the comfort of your own home to reduce the risk of high cholesterol. Staying active helps your body move the bad cholesterol to your liver where it can be eventually removed out of your system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In fact, there are four quick exercises you can add to your daily routine to see health benefits. While ‘bad’ cholesterol increases your risk of life-threatening illnesses such as heart disease and stroke, there is also ‘good’ cholesterol that performs crucial functions the body cannot survive without, such as making hormones, building cells, aiding digestion and synthesising vitamin D from sunlight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although high cholesterol is often managed with medication called statins - taken by millions of people in the UK every day - lifestyle changes can help to keep things under control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Quick exercises:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taking the stairs: &lt;/b&gt;This daily simple swap can be an easy way to give you a more active lifestyle, if you can, avoid taking the lift and opt for the stairs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brisk walk: &lt;/b&gt;Getting steps in could be a great addition to kicking off a healthier lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two-minute exercise:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="http://bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/risk-factors/high-cholesterol/five-top-questions-about-lowering-cholesterol" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; suggests bursts of jumping jacks several times a day can be a great way to stay active.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yoga or Pilates: &lt;/b&gt;If you're looking for low impact exercise that will still ensure you stay active, try following a YouTube video or joining a local class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study in 'Sports Medicine' found that almost any kind of exercise can have a major impact on cholesterol. Another study suggests that psychological stress was also a contributing factor to high cholesterol, and physical activity could mitigate that risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any major changes you make, make sure to consult a medical professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 07:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxNekdXVEhYMk03S2o5X1ViMkZaVkxxZF9sODRtdmh4X09YUXpUbXAzNDZZdFFLTXdsMG1HT0FxMFJLRFQ2Y3l6TE5KY1pZbnZ4YU5aaV9ka3JsYXpoNlhqY1VLUEI1WTdBY0hyQmJ0cUk5NlNhS3liTENobmx3ZUNRNE13NkVHQQ</guid></item><item><title>以色列科学家首次开发用于早期检测帕金森氏症的血液检测-以色列时报 | Israeli scientists develop first-ever blood test for early detection of Parkinson’s - The Times of Israel</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of Israel</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 06:49:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxPSHdxcmRaQmN5R1JDM05uM3J3eTJrcm9oVU5UYS0tMlJkWWliNU1ZUnExSVV4bzJuLUdSZWhUYWRQSERvR0szSEl1TDRLeUpjZEw4QmNlNFBxM2pPcnI0TjlhdTNGanpkbGRVYTNtRXJOLXlMZ3I0eFhTTnFLSnl5Nk5iS1ozakJ5aTRNTl9FQVZZNy1PRHJ4RVJNVXJRRHZGY2N5WXl0YTVvRjBnZnpyYXZPVdIBuAFBVV95cUxNQ0JqMThuTkl5Rm1UUm00dTdZLXdQa3Zadkp4eTFkSXZrdnpUNEg2YmI0U1JUVDNfbGRSTVBLZWJLSkEyNnotYjNuZDUxa1BoOERLaGFXUzJBM2VqWnlyb3dQRlpIR1lLR3l0OXdfZ1lfTmxmeXFSdzUyMUQ3d3RUTDYybWt2MU1NZlNNM2dIWnFKaEJGZXdGNjNmblNtRWtLUDRwR212amJOZVBESEhzQnU3dHZMeG93</guid></item><item><title>“被遗忘的”西南皮肤患者的生活地狱- BBC | Living hell for 'forgotten' South West skin patients - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBWamJfazNlT1BjdklFR0EtOTBnRDRsRnBkTFhlSmwwOXVyV3lkZ1pVN2QtQ2dGbENaMXctT1dROGdJcUcxTHlpeXptZFBWb2FWYWZZelk5X3hBUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1rNmc1TllDZGVpTEVkYklhQnBaU2d4UFRVQVNCYjVETHBha1hhcHlvS0NRMzl1X0lFcFVUZGNRVEhzMDBaeEJxVW5kd0tsLXBtR1Joak5jVDFKUkMtR2ZV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Living hell for 'forgotten' skin patients&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Amy Gladwell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC South West Investigations Team&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5627/live/2c4da040-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Head and shoulders of Elle Jones, 19, with medium brown straight hair and fair skin, standing on a winter beach.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies and young children may breathe and absorb plasticizers called phthalates, flame retardants, and other harmful chemicals from their mattresses while they sleep, according to a pair of studies published by the University of Toronto in &lt;i&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/i&gt;. These chemicals are linked to neurological and reproductive problems, asthma, hormone disruption, and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"Sleep is vital for brain development, particularly for infants and toddlers. However, our research suggests that many mattresses contain chemicals that can harm kids' brains," says senior author Miriam Diamond, professor at the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a wake-up call for manufacturers and policymakers to ensure our children's beds are safe and support healthy &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+development/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain development&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00051" target="_blank"&gt;first study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers measured chemical concentrations in 25 bedrooms of children aged 6 months to 4 years. They detected concerning levels of more than two dozen phthalates, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/flame+retardants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;flame retardants&lt;/a&gt;, and UV-filters in bedroom air, with the highest levels lurking around the beds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.5c03560" target="_blank"&gt;companion study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers tested 16 newly purchased children's mattresses and confirmed that they are likely the major source of these chemicals in children's sleeping environments. When the researchers simulated a child's body temperature and weight on the mattresses, chemical emissions increased substantially, as much as by several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mattresses were purchased in Canada, but most contained materials originating from other countries, including the U.S. and Mexico. Because of integrated mattress markets and supply chains, the results are likely to apply to mattresses purchased throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The phthalates and organophosphate ester flame retardants measured in this study are hormone disruptors and are linked to neurological harms, including learning disorders, reduced IQ scores, behavioral problems, and impaired memory. Some are also linked to childhood asthma and cancer. Several UV-filters are hormone disruptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children are uniquely vulnerable to exposure, given that they are still developing, have hand-to-mouth behaviors, and have breathing rates ten times higher than adults. They also have more permeable skin and three times the skin surface area relative to their body weight than adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high levels of flame retardants in most of the mattresses tested were puzzling, given these chemicals are not necessary to pass either Canadian or U.S. mattress flammability standards. Flame retardants are linked to neurological, reproductive, and hormonal harm as well as cancer, and also have no proven fire-safety benefit as used in mattresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Parents should be able to lay their children down for sleep knowing they are safe and snug," said co-author Arlene Blum, Executive Director of the Green Science Policy Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Flame retardants have a long history of harming our children's cognitive function and ability to learn. It's concerning that these chemicals are still being found in children's mattresses even though we know they have no proven fire-safety benefit, and aren't needed to comply with flammability standards."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers call for manufacturers to be more vigilant about the chemicals in children's mattresses through testing. Further, stronger regulations on the use of flame retardants and phthalate plasticizers in children's mattresses are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In Canada, the authors recommend extending restrictions on certain plasticizers from toys and objects to be mouthed to include mattresses and other bedding items and passing long-proposed restrictions on two flame retardants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several mattresses had chemicals that are banned or restricted in Canada, suggesting that manufacturers need to test children's mattresses for these chemicals and other unnecessary chemicals before putting them on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, there are actions parents can take to reduce their children's exposure. The authors recommend decluttering your child's sleeping area by reducing the number of pillows, blankets, and toys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also recommend washing and refreshing your child's bedding and bed clothing frequently since these act as a protective barrier to reduce exposure. Finally, they say that undyed or neutral colored fabrics are likely safer since keeping strong colors requires the addition of UV-filters and other additives that may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you struggle to reach your daily movement goal or you’re too busy for regular walks, the trending 666 walking challenge could help you hit your target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It involves doing a six-minute warm-up, walking for 60 minutes, then doing a six-minute cool-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do this at 6am or 6pm, depending on your schedule—and according to walking coach &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.joyceshulman.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.joyceshulman.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Joyce Shulman&lt;/a&gt;, it's a great way to experience the many &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking"&gt;benefits of walking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-should-you-do-the-666-walking-challenge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When should you do the 666 walking challenge?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can walk at either 6am or 6pm—or both times if you like—but Shulman says there are some big benefits to morning strolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking first thing in the morning is really good to help set your circadian rhythm,” says Shulman, which she explains can promote better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/fulltext/2020/10000/consistent_morning_exercise_may_be_beneficial_for.7.aspx" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/fulltext/2020/10000/consistent_morning_exercise_may_be_beneficial_for.7.aspx" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;also tells us that people who typically exercise first thing in the morning are more likely to stick to their routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you're struggling to be consistent with exercise, morning walks can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-dVtPoWQ955kqfxzknrZq5Y" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-dVtPoWQ955kqfxzknrZq5Y slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement is also great for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/abm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/abm/kaae059/7828202?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/abm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/abm/kaae059/7828202?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;, so it's good to do your walk before you sit down to start your working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't worry if you can only squeeze in a walk at 6pm, as that offers its own benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An evening walk helps move digestion along, and reduces bloating,” Shulman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some people, but not all, it can help them sleep better that night. So, this idea of bookending your day with a walk is brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I walk both before and after work to shift myself from one part of my day to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I allow the movement and time in nature to soothe my mind, so I'm ready for the next task—a helpful way to mentally shift gears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-many-steps-will-you-take-in-60-minutes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How many steps will you take in 60 minutes?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your stride length and pace will impact your 60 minute step count, so this will vary from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, a 60-minute walk tends to be about 5,500 to 6,000 steps, which gets me pretty close to a 10,000-step target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-s-the-benefit-of-warming-up-before-exercise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What's the benefit of warming up before exercise?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're supposed to spend six minutes warming up, and six minutes cooling down, for this walking challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do any kind of movement you like for these periods (such as these &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/dynamic-stretches" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/dynamic-stretches"&gt;dynamic stretches&lt;/a&gt;) but you can also simply slow your usual walking speed to a more leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmups and cooldowns allow your body to adjust to the change in activity level, which can improve your muscle flexibility, lubricate joints and potentially prevent post-exercise soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While walking isn’t generally considered to be intense exercise, I find these periods are also helpful for getting you in the right frame of mind for the gentle workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

It’s concerning that these chemicals are still being found in children’s mattresses even though we know they have no proven fire-safety benefit, and aren’t needed to comply with flammability standards.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers tested children's mattresses and found they contained concerningly high levels of toxins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Phthalates are chemicals used to make products more flexible and able to withstand certain conditions, as well as help reduce cracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These substances are found in makeup, nail polish, hair spray, body lotion, shampoos and cleansers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They've been linked to infertility, breast cancer, obesity, cardiovascular and neurological complications and behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While flame retardants are added to products to make them less flammable and can be in anything from clothing to furniture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have been linked to an increased risk of brain damage, neurological development problems, lower IQ and attention, learning and behavioral disorders in children.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said: 'Children are uniquely vulnerable to exposure, given that they are still developing, have hand-to-mouth behaviors, and have breathing rates ten times higher than adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They also have more permeable skin and three times the skin surface area relative to their body weight than adults.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the researchers discovered the high levels of toxins in children's mattresses, they tested the items again after simulating a child's body sleeping on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the simulated temperature and weight on the mattresses, emissions of the chemicals increased substantially - in some cases by several times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the products tested were purchased in Canada, most contained materials originating from other countries, including America and Mexico and the researchers said the results are likely to apply to mattresses purchased throughout North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Miriam Diamond, professor at the University of Toronto, said: 'Sleep is vital for brain development, particularly for infants and toddlers. However, our research suggests that many mattresses contain chemicals that can harm kids’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a wake-up call for manufacturers and policymakers to ensure our children’s beds are safe and support healthy brain development.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To reduce a child's exposure, the researchers recommend using undyed and neutral bedding, which is less likely to contain harmful chemicals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the levels of flame retardants found in the mattresses were 'puzzling' given the chemicals are not necessary to pass Canadian or US flammability standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result of their findings, the researchers are calling for manufacturers to be more vigilant about the chemicals they use in their products and for there to be stronger regulations on the use of these toxins in children's products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, three types of phthalates are banned from use in children's items. The UK bans four.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US also has loose restrictions when it comes to phthalates in food products, while the UK severely limits seven types of the substances in all food contact materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while there is no formal prohibition of phthalate use in American cosmetics, the UK either tightly controls or completely bans certain phthalates from cosmetic products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While regulations and manufacturers work to improve products, the team advised parents to take their own action, including decluttering a child's sleeping area of pillows, blankets and toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also recommended washing and refreshing a child's bedding and pajamas, as well as only using undyed or neutral fabrics as those are less likely to contain toxic chemicals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, our research suggests that many mattresses contain chemicals that can harm kids’ brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a wake-up call for manufacturers and policymakers to ensure our children’s beds are safe and support healthy brain development.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To reduce a child's exposure, the researchers recommend using undyed and neutral bedding, which is less likely to contain harmful chemicals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said the levels of flame retardants found in the mattresses were 'puzzling' given the chemicals are not necessary to pass Canadian or US flammability standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result of their findings, the researchers are calling for manufacturers to be more vigilant about the chemicals they use in their products and for there to be stronger regulations on the use of these toxins in children's products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, three types of phthalates are banned from use in children's items. The UK bans four.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US also has loose restrictions when it comes to phthalates in food products, while the UK severely limits seven types of the substances in all food contact materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while there is no formal prohibition of phthalate use in American cosmetics, the UK either tightly controls or completely bans certain phthalates from cosmetic products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While regulations and manufacturers work to improve products, the team advised parents to take their own action, including decluttering a child's sleeping area of pillows, blankets and toys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also recommended washing and refreshing a child's bedding and pajamas, as well as only using undyed or neutral fabrics as those are less likely to contain toxic chemicals.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When visual information enters the brain, it travels through two pathways that process different aspects of the input. For decades, scientists have hypothesized that one of these pathways, the ventral visual stream, is responsible for recognizing objects, and that it might have been optimized by evolution to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent with this, in the past decade, MIT scientists have found that when computational models of the anatomy of the ventral stream are optimized to solve the task of object recognition, they are remarkably good predictors of the neural activities in the ventral stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in a new study, MIT researchers have shown that when they train these types of models on spatial tasks instead, the resulting models are also quite good predictors of the ventral stream’s neural activities. This suggests that the ventral stream may not be exclusively optimized for object recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This leaves wide open the question about what the ventral stream is being optimized for. I think the dominant perspective a lot of people in our field believe is that the ventral stream is optimized for object recognition, but this study provides a new perspective that the ventral stream could be optimized for spatial tasks as well,” says MIT graduate student Yudi Xie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xie is the lead author of the study, which will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations. Other authors of the paper include Weichen Huang, a visiting student through MIT’s Research Science Institute program; Esther Alter, a software engineer at the MIT Quest for Intelligence; Jeremy Schwartz, a sponsored research technical staff member; Joshua Tenenbaum, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences; and James DiCarlo, the Peter de Florez Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, director of the Quest for Intelligence, and a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond object recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we look at an object, our visual system can not only identify the object, but also determine other features such as its location, its distance from us, and its orientation in space. Since the early 1980s, neuroscientists have hypothesized that the primate visual system is divided into two pathways: the ventral stream, which performs object-recognition tasks, and the dorsal stream, which processes features related to spatial location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, researchers have worked to model the ventral stream using a type of deep-learning model known as a convolutional neural network (CNN). Researchers can train these models to perform object-recognition tasks by feeding them datasets containing thousands of images along with category labels describing the images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state-of-the-art versions of these CNNs have high success rates at categorizing images. Additionally, researchers have found that the internal activations of the models are very similar to the activities of neurons that process visual information in the ventral stream. Furthermore, the more similar these models are to the ventral stream, the better they perform at object-recognition tasks. This has led many researchers to hypothesize that the dominant function of the ventral stream is recognizing objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experimental studies, especially &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4247" target="_blank"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; from the DiCarlo lab in 2016, have found that the ventral stream appears to encode spatial features as well. These features include the object’s size, its orientation (how much it is rotated), and its location within the field of view. Based on these studies, the MIT team aimed to investigate whether the ventral stream might serve additional functions beyond object recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our central question in this project was, is it possible that we can think about the ventral stream as being optimized for doing these spatial tasks instead of just categorization tasks?” Xie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, the researchers set out to train a CNN to identify one or more spatial features of an object, including rotation, location, and distance. To train the models, they created a new dataset of synthetic images. These images show objects such as tea kettles or calculators superimposed on different backgrounds, in locations and orientations that are labeled to help the model learn them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that CNNs that were trained on just one of these spatial tasks showed a high level of “neuro-alignment” with the ventral stream — very similar to the levels seen in CNN models trained on object recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measure neuro-alignment using a technique that DiCarlo’s lab has developed, which involves asking the models, once trained, to predict the neural activity that a particular image would generate in the brain. The researchers found that the better the models performed on the spatial task they had been trained on, the more neuro-alignment they showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we cannot assume that the ventral stream is just doing object categorization, because many of these other functions, such as spatial tasks, also can lead to this strong correlation between models’ neuro-alignment and their performance,” Xie says. “Our conclusion is that you can optimize either through categorization or doing these spatial tasks, and they both give you a ventral-stream-like model, based on our current metrics to evaluate neuro-alignment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then investigated why these two approaches — training for object recognition and training for spatial features — led to similar degrees of neuro-alignment. To do that, they performed an analysis known as centered kernel alignment (CKA), which allows them to measure the degree of similarity between representations in different CNNs. This analysis showed that in the early to middle layers of the models, the representations that the models learn are nearly indistinguishable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In these early layers, essentially you cannot tell these models apart by just looking at their representations,” Xie says. “It seems like they learn some very similar or unified representation in the early to middle layers, and in the later stages they diverge to support different tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesize that even when models are trained to analyze just one feature, they also take into account “non-target” features — those that they are not trained on. When objects have greater variability in non-target features, the models tend to learn representations more similar to those learned by models trained on other tasks. This suggests that the models are using all of the information available to them, which may result in different models coming up with similar representations, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More non-target variability actually helps the model learn a better representation, instead of learning a representation that’s ignorant of them,” Xie says. “It’s possible that the models, although they’re trained on one target, are simultaneously learning other things due to the variability of these non-target features.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future work, the researchers hope to develop new ways to compare different models, in hopes of learning more about how each one develops internal representations of objects based on differences in training tasks and training data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There could be still slight differences between these models, even though our current way of measuring how similar these models are to the brain tells us they’re on a very similar level. That suggests maybe there’s still some work to be done to improve upon how we can compare the model to the brain, so that we can better understand what exactly the ventral stream is optimized for,” Xie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Semiconductor Research Corporation and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.&lt;/p&gt;

                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawaii Department of Health officials today said the child confirmed to have measles on Oahu after international travel has fully recovered at home, and they have identified 92 people who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department on April 8 announced Hawaii’s &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/hawaii-confirms-travel-related-measles-case-in-child-under-5/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt; first measles case &lt;/a&gt;of the year in a child under age 5 who returned from international travel. An adult member of the child’s household who came down with symptoms remains a presumptive case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, no new suspected measles cases have otherwise been reported in Hawaii, according to a department news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through contact-tracing efforts, health officials have identified 92 individuals exposed to one or both cases at various locations on Oahu, including Manoa Valley District Park and Queen’s Island Urgent Care at Kapahulu. They have reached 88 of these contacts, DOH said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All but 10 of these individuals have been vaccinated against measles or have other evidence of immunity to measles, DOH said. The 10 people with no evidence of immunity have been instructed to isolate at home, and are under active monitoring, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”There may be individuals who were exposed in public settings and are not known to DOH,” they said in a news release. “DOH has identified all exposed contacts from all exposure locations except the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members of the public may have been exposed to measles if they were at the following locations at Honolulu airport during these specified times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;March 30, 10:50 a.m.-2 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt;: C gates, customs and baggage claim area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;April 4, 1-7 p.m&lt;/strong&gt;.: Terminal 2 departures, TSA checkpoints, and gate area for Delta flight 309 to Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said symptoms of measles may appear up to 21 days after exposure. Anyone who may have been exposed and develops measles symptoms should isolate at home and contact their doctor immediately, DOH said. They should also inform the Health Department immediately of possible exposure and symptoms via its disease reporting line is 808-586-4586.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department offers the following advice and information regarding the highly contagious disease:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If exposed, be vigilant. The first symptoms of measles usually start seven to 10 days after exposure but can start as late as 21 days. A rash will follow other symptoms in two to four days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Symptoms include runny nose, watery eyes, cough, fever greater than 101 degrees and a rash, beginning on the face and spreading downward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Measles spreads through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; An infected person can spread measles to others from four days before developing a rash through four days afterward. The virus can remain in the air up to two hours after an infected person has left the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There is no specific treatment for measles. Care of patients with measles consists mainly of ensuring adequate intake of fluids, bed rest and fever control. Patients with complications may need treatment specific to their situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Vaccination is the best way to be protect and prevent an outbreak. Anyone who has not been vaccinated or has no immunity against measles, should contact their health care provider about getting the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                                
                                
                                
                                                                
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

She was failed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand is the second child to die in the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14600461/Where-worlds-infectious-disease-spreading-US-24-states-report-cases.html"&gt;escalating measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; gripping West Texas, where antivaccine conspiracy thinking has become rife and there has been an erosion of trust in public institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death was confirmed to be from measles by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-2bef6a60-1964-11f0-a36b-639c9a17c30a" class=""&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;). Hidlebrand, however, claims his daughter's death was not caused by the virus, but by a failure in her medical care, a lack of proper treatment and prejudice against their faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family are Mennonite, part of a small Christian community that often emphasizes 'natural remedies' over modern medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com spoke to several locals, including young mothers, farmhands and truckers, in Seminole who were skeptical about vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They falsely claimed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14583809/rfk-jr-u-turn-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak-milestone.html"&gt;the vaccines contained 'dangerous stuff'&lt;/a&gt; and that big pharma used them to make money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaccine exemptions in Gaines County, where Seminole is based, are among the highest in the state and nationwide. About 13 percent of children attending local schools have a conscientious exemption for vaccines, compared to three percent nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Seminole, Texas is at the center of a measles outbreak as antivaccine conspiracy thinking  becomes rife and trust in public institutions drops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is Peter Hildebrand with his wife Eva and two of his children. They met with anti-vaccine crusader RFK Jr, health secretary, after the death of their daughter &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eight-year-old Daisy Hildebrand is the second child to die in the escalating measles outbreak gripping West Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daisy, once a healthy and energetic child, got sick about a month ago. She came down with a fever, sore throat, and eventually pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family tried to treat their daughter at home with cod liver oil, popular in the community for helping to 'strengthen the immune system'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when that failed, they took her to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnosed her with strep throat, mononucleosis, a contagious viral infection, and measles. She was given antibiotics and sent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within three days, her condition worsened. Rushed back to the hospital with severe pneumonia, she was treated again — this time unsuccessfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daisy was the second child to die in the outbreak. Six-year-old Kayley Fehr, also unvaccinated and from the same Mennonite community, succumbed just weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They both mark the first deaths from measles in the US in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 700 cases of measles have been recorded nationwide so far this year, with 541 of these recorded in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This number of cases is the worst since 2019 and is on track to become the worst in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Texas outbreak, 70 percent of cases - or more than two thirds - are among children and young babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though measles itself is viral, it weakens the immune system and leaves patients vulnerable to deadly secondary infections, especially pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Mr Hildebrand rejects that explanation in Daisy’s case — and places little faith in the vaccines public health officials are urging the community to adopt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The [MMR] vaccine ain't worth a damn,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My brother's family got it and they all still got sick — worse than my unvaccinated kids. This isn't about the vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The measles vaccine is 93 percent effective at preventing infections after one dose, and 97 percent effective after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Joselyn doesn’t want to get her children vaccinated despite the outbreak because she claims to know people who’ve had adverse reactions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Judy said her family hasn’t got the MMR vaccine because they ‘don’t like the things in it’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without vaccination, however, there is a high risk of suffering from a measles infection - which is particularly dangerous in children under five years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In unvaccinated children, about one in five who are infected with measles are hospitalized, while one in 20 suffer from pneumonia, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in 1,000 will also develop encephalitis, a swelling on the brain that can lead to convulsions, going deaf and intellectual disability, and about one to three in every 1,000 die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mennonite community's relationship with vaccination is complicated. Though scripture doesn't strictly forbid vaccines, many in the community believe it should be a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 3,000 people in Gaines County follow the Mennonite faith, according to figures from 2010, out of the more than 22,000 residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, Gaines County has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country: just 82 percent of kindergartners received the MMR vaccine last year — far below the 95 percent threshold required for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the outbreak, hesitancy remains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At Healthy 2 U, a Mennonite-run supplement shop in Seminole, shelves are stocked with cod liver oil rich in vitamin A — an alternative therapy promoted by some vaccine skeptics as a natural defense against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We recommend it to everyone who gets sick,' says store manager Nancy, a mother of 10 and grandmother of nineteen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there are some who are still in favor of vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a parking lot outside &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/walmart/index.html" id="mol-7b514a20-196d-11f0-a36b-639c9a17c30a" class=""&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, DailyMail.com met two Mennonite women — Helen and Helena. One said she vaccinated her children, saying it was the right thing to do, while the other said she didn't vaccinate her children believing infections like measles 'make their immune system stronger'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Steven, a local designer, said everyone should get vaccinated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the entry-way to the measles testing and vaccination center in West Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The town of Seminole, with just 7,000 residents, has been quietly grappling with the epidemic. Outside the local testing and vaccination clinic, DailyMail.com saw a slow trickle of patients — many coming for blood tests to determine if they have measles antibodies, a form of proof of immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, many in the town are skeptical. Some believe the outbreak is slowing; others say they're hearing of 'more patients than ever'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local health director Zach Holbrooks says traffic to the clinic varies, with some days seeing no patients and others over a dozen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He urges vaccinations, calling them the best protection against hospitalization and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs around town warn of the outbreak, but they're easy to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without large banners or public broadcasts, visitors may pass through Seminole and be completely unaware that the nation's worst measles outbreak in years is unfolding here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hildebrand is determined, however, to overturn the report that his daughter was killed by measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recently met with RFK Jr during a visit to the area earlier this month. 'He didn't mention vaccines once,' Mr Hildebrand says. 'But he was the nicest man I ever met.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his visit, RFK Jr wrote on X: 'The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Daisy was laid to rest alongside Kayley in a modest Mennonite churchyard, her father hopes her story sparks reflection — if not on vaccines, then on care, compassion, and the urgent need to protect the vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was my little girl,' he says softly. 'And they let her down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Health officials in Hood River County confirmed Monday that two local deaths have been linked to a rare brain disease within the last eight months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During that period, the county said, there have been one confirmed and two probable cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD, a prion disorder somewhat similar to the more commonly known "mad cow disease." So far, two of those cases have resulted in death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a very rare form of a dementia," explained Dr. Peter Pressman, a neurologist with OHSU's Layton Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Center. "Certain proteins called prions misfold and kind of cascade through the brain, causing damage as they go. This results in thinking difficulties, memory difficulties, movement problems and other symptoms."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no known treatment for CJD, and cases tend to be fatal within a year. It's more likely to affect older adults, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, and symptoms can include dementia, sudden jerky movements, trouble walking and visual disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's true, there's no cure, but we still offer help, as best we can, resources for patients and their families...trying first to ensure that it's not something else that is more treatable," Pressman said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the risk of getting CJD is extremely low, Hood River health officials said, because it does not spread through the air, by touch, through social contact or the water supply.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike mad cow disease, CJD is not generally tied to infected meat, either — the vast majority of cases are "sporadic," the CDC says, which means they occur spontaneously in older adults. A smaller number of cases are caused by an inherited mutation, and an extremely small number of cases are contacted through health care settings.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials have found no identifiable link between the three Hood River County cases, but health officials are monitoring cases of the disease as required by state law. The investigation is being done in partnership with the Oregon Health Authority and CDC.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States sees between 500 and 600 cases of CJD each year, according to the CDC, or about one to two cases per one million people. Hood River County's population is just under 24,000 per the latest census data, so three cases would represent an outlier if confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I've seen a number of these cases and they tend to hit hard because people who were very vibrant not so long ago, and sometimes at relatively young and productive times of life, just suddenly decompensate," said Pressman. "It's hard to watch as a provider as well as someone who cares about patients."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

The virus is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14474859/gene-hackman-wife-betsy-arakawa-death-hantavirus-symptoms.html"&gt;rare in the US&lt;/a&gt;, with fewer than 50 cases reported yearly. For reference, there are roughly 2,000 cases of West Nile Virus reported in the US annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is partly because the US has fewer rodent species than Asian countries. Hantaviruses in the US primarily circulate in fewer rodent species compared to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/asia/index.html" id="mol-28cee9f0-1937-11f0-85d1-d5db88e7340b"&gt;Asia&lt;/a&gt; and Europe, where multiple rodent species act as hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-c1b28bd0-1974-11f0-85f0-113a49f63e3e"&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt; Tech researchers found that while deer mice are still the primary reservoir for hantaviruses in North America, the virus circulates more widely than previously thought – detecting antibodies in six additional rodent species where hantavirus was not documented before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest that hantaviruses may circulate among a broader range of rodents, though human infection risk is still highest in areas with high deer mouse populations, especially in Southwestern states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Betsy Arakawa was found dead in the Santa Fe home she shared with her husband, Gene Hackman, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding their passing gripped the nation’s attention for weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses, which kill around 50 percent of patients, are a group of viruses found worldwide and can cause deadly diseases with fatality rates comparable to serious illnesses like Ebola, which has a death rate ranging from about 60 to as much as 90 percent, depending on the strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hantaviruses, which are spread to people when they inhale aerosolized fecal matter, urine, or saliva from infected rodents, cause distinct diseases based on their geographic regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Asia, the Hantaan virus causes hemorrhagic fever with kidney disease, while in Europe, the same condition is linked to the Dobrava-Belgrade virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Americas, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is caused by the Sin Nombre virus and the Andes virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Sin Nombre virus was first identified in New Mexico in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Virginia Tech team &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2025/04/hantavirus-environmental-factors-influence-distribution-paanwaris-paansri-luis-escobar.html"&gt;analyzed data&lt;/a&gt; from the National Science Foundation's National Ecological Observatory Network to better understand how hantavirus spreads in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They focused on how environmental factors and geographic patterns affect the rodent species that carry the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Arakawa was infected with hantavirus which caused a deadly build-up of fluid in her lungs, known medically as hentavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Hackman died of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2014 and 2019, the program gathered and tested 14,004 blood samples from 49 different species at 45 locations across the US to test for levels of hantavirus antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Seventy-nine percent of positive blood samples came from deer mice species, which cause around 90 percent of all hantavirus cases in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These species showed the highest infection rates in their blood at three percent based on 116 positive samples, which was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, researchers found that some rodent species, like Peromyscus truei and Microtus pennsylvanicus, had a higher percentage of hantavirus infections than deer mice – between 4.3 and 4.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paanwaris Paansri, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation and co-author of the study, said: ‘In North America, Peromyscus maniculatus, the deer mouse, is the most common carrier, but our study also revealed that other rodent species have a higher prevalence of hantavirus, which changes the current paradigm in hantavirus circulation in wildlife.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, these numbers can be misconstrued to pose a greater threat than actually exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are based on much smaller sample sizes: only nine out of 184 P. truei and 33 out of 768 M. pennsylvanicus tested positive. Meanwhile, 116 out of 3,919 deer mice were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the sample is small, even a few positive cases can skew the percentage to appear high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows hantavirus cases recorded in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of human cases are traced back to two or three key deer mouse species, and there is no evidence these species sustain outbreaks or significantly increase human risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, according to Mr Paansri, these findings reveal that the virus is more flexible than scientists once thought, broadening what they know about its basic biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Virginia had the highest infection rate among rodents, with nearly eight percent of 99 samples testing positive for hantavirus – 3.8 times the national average of around two percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorado had the second-highest infection rate, followed by Texas, both known risk regions for the virus, with average positive blood samples more than twice as high as the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team’s findings could influence how public health officials monitor and evaluate hantavirus risk and help clarify human cases in areas where the usual rodent host is uncommon or missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Paansri said: ‘This new information is expected to help us understand where and when hantavirus is most likely to occur, which is crucial for predicting outbreaks and informing public health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We believe that many lessons learned from this study can be generalized to other wildlife diseases, considering that their distribution is global.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:55:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxQTDg2ekpxUm5ycmFPNGpkQUJDVnhDcFBQNTM3T19wYkN3T2xOOVZ5bWx6bll0THFya2xjcW9PaV9sS29lRHRSZThqejB1Vm1MU0pkZ2NQT3ZXRF8tOFNZdzVWQ0dFWjI3Vlc1S3BVaVh6NGVKcFpNVi1MT09uVmc3d3I4dHBtSDRjMkhPMktnVTdGbEl4VkZWOXh0M2hCSzJhU29mY2R0NDhtZS1VRVA3b0t0dS1jbTY1QmfSAb8BQVVfeXFMTkhBaThBaVhhVUx6bUM2YlRseDFuYmwtUjJ6Q19fXzF1enRfYkJjYW1Lc2RtcGdMelk1alROMVhVNDhaRFk0QzF1dS1Rb3RHLXc1cVJBTTZ6UGpGbTF2WFczMUNRajVEQUt0dzdHaGdNaTN4VS11Q2N3bnpsTlF3eDRCWXRUQVRvcFdjYUcyeURDenRSNjR2bmZhRGlqaUtpYlYwU2dqcHc4LXhQNFV2S1FpVHgwRW9UNDNzbnVjN1E</guid></item><item><title>随着神秘的大脑疾病在美国不太可能的县蔓延，医生发出警报-每日邮报 | Doctors sound alarm as mystery brain disease spreads in unlikely US county - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two people in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oregon/index.html" id="mol-5d9ada70-196b-11f0-85d1-d5db88e7340b"&gt;Oregon&lt;/a&gt; have died of a rare brain disorder that causes dementia-like symptoms without a clear cause or possible link tying the deaths together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials in Hood River County, home to about 24,000 people in northern Oregon, have identified three cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease over the past eight months, two of which have been fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is rare - infecting about 350 Americans per year - but it is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13261007/michigan-woman-dies-rare-fatal-brain-disease-cjd.html"&gt;almost always fatal&lt;/a&gt;. The disease, which causes&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14599453/harvard-experts-overlooked-risk-factors-dementia-preventable.html"&gt; a rapid descent into dementia&lt;/a&gt;, is caused by faulty proteins in the brain called prions that corrupt healthy ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The underlying trigger of CJD remains unclear and most cases are sporadic with no known cause. However, some forms are genetic or linked to contaminated beef. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not spread from person-to-person unless in the case of infected transplanted organs, and Oregon officials do not know if the state's cases are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One patient was confirmed by autopsy to have died of CJD, while the other death is believed to be caused by CJD. State pathologists are examining brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid, one of the two ways to diagnose CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rarely, a brain biopsy is performed to confirm the disease, which involves surgically removing brain tissue and often results in brain bleeding, infection, and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A third person suspected of having the disease is still alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Trish Elliott, director of Hood River County Health Department, said: ‘We’re trying to look at any common risk factors that might link these cases … but it’s pretty hard in some cases to come up with what the real cause is.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Panel B shows a section of the cerebral cortex where prions have killed white matter in the brain, creating lots of tiny holes, a pattern called “status spongiosis,” caused by severe nerve cell loss. Panel C shows severe damage in the deeper layer of white matter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials declined to give personal details on the patients or say whether the three cases were from the same household or family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A variant of CJD has been tied to eating meat from cattle infected with mad cow disease, another prion disorder, but Elliott said the cases in Hood River are not believed to be linked to cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eighty-five percent of CJD cases are ‘sporadic,’ meaning they have no apparent cause or recognizable pattern of spreading, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 10 to 14 percent of CJD cases are caused by mutations in the PRNP gene, which encodes for the prion protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The remaining one percent are caused by external factors, such as eating infected beef or undergoing medical procedures with infected tools or receiving transplanted organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It typically affects people in their 50s and older and presents as rapid degeneration of brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients usually die within four or five months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are outliers, though. A 22-year-old college student &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cellular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncel.2024.1518542/full"&gt;lived for seven months&lt;/a&gt; with progressively worsening dementia tied to CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prion diseases primarily affect people in their 50s and older and presents as rapid degeneration of brain tissue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A previously high-functioning college student, she returned home from school and began experiencing severe anxiety, prompting treatment with benzodiazepines prescribed by a doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, her symptoms worsened. She experienced hallucinations, sleepwalking, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also developed repetitive behaviors and became fixated on completing tasks like handwashing and toothbrushing in a precise manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She soon began to experience cognitive issues, including memory problems, trouble doing familiar tasks, and forgetting the names of close family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors performed MRIs, cerebral spinal fluid tests, and genetic testing to determine the cause and suspected it to be CJD. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t confirmed until the patient died, though, by examining brain tissue in the lab, spotting the sponge-like holes indicative of CJD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early signs of the disease include unexplained mood shifts, irritability, paranoia, delusions and other symptoms of psychosis, and social withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the following weeks or months, CJD causes aggression, confusion, memory loss, inability to speak or eat, and incontinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hood River County Health Department did not disclose when the three cases first became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials issued a warning to local health workers to keep CJD in mind when they treat patients exhibiting signs of rapid descent into dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They maintain that the risk to the public is low.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 00:54:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>用于治疗阿尔茨海默氏症的尼古丁贴片-尼古丁能帮助您记住吗？ -人民药房 | Nicotine Patch for Alzheimer’s—Could Nicotine Help You Remember? - The People's Pharmacy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOU2RZa3Y0U0c1VEJlbHQyeEFOVWl1Ykc3SnZjQVpIa2R3ckt5VWpVNnBDcms5dEIyOG1idHVvSUdKREM4NUpuS3Z3RU1YcThBVkZaV2JOelRaOVhSSk5tQVhRZ1RWSDJNZ2Jlcy15TU9yRTNHZm53ai1ZQnVSTWJ3aEhob091Uk9Ta2JIcUo5SkZMQzZKSWs1NFR1cnNtcTRLV1VURW1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article_content__HD4YK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades researchers have considered nicotine a serious health problem. It is, after all, the addicting compound in cigarettes and other tobacco products. Humans have apparently been using tobacco as a drug for over 12,000 years (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34635825/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, Feb. 2022&lt;/a&gt;). It has been smoked, snuffed and chewed. More recently, drug companies have created the nicotine patch. It is supposed to help people &lt;em&gt;stop&lt;/em&gt; smoking. Could it also help people who are suffering from Alzheimer disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Short History of Nicotine and Dementia:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1970s researchers were beginning to identify acetylcholine as a key problem in Alzheimer’s disease (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/589485/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Research&lt;/em&gt;, Dec. 16, 1977&lt;/a&gt;). This critical neurotransmitter was deficient in the brains of patients with AD (Alzheimer’s disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Damage to the hippocampal formation, whether focal or diffuse, leads to severe impairment of short-term memory. The most common presenting symptom of Alzheimer disease is loss of short-term memory, and histologically the hippocampus is characteristically affected. Choline acetyltransferase, which is involved in the synthesis of acetylcholine, is depleted in the hippocampus in the disorder. Anticholinergic drugs administered to normal subjects can simulate some aspects of the memory defect seen in Alzheimer disease. It is postulated that damage to a cholinergic neuronal pathway running to or from the hippocampus underlies the memory disorder. This suggestion implies that it may be possible to improve memory in patients with Alzheimer disease by pharmacological means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did your eyes glaze over or did you grasp the meaning of that last sentence? These scientists were suggesting that you might be able to “improve memory” with drugs that somehow enhance cholinergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;They go on to state that:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, there is pharmacologic evidence that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is involved in memory processes in man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guess what? Nicotine stimulates acetylcholine receptors in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What About a Nicotine Patch to Stimulate Cholinergic Receptors?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/reduce-your-risk-of-dementia/smoking"&gt;Alzheimer’s Society&lt;/a&gt; has even gone so far as to ask this question:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;“Can nicotine reduce dementia risk”&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is some evidence that exposure to nicotine, which is one of the components of cigarette smoke, can actually reduce the risk of dementia. Such reports may be useful in indicating possible research directions for drug design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, nicotine intake through smoking would not be beneficial. Any positive effects would be outweighed by the significant harm caused by the other toxic components in cigarette smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This brings us to a recent question from a visitor to this website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Reader Asks About Using the Nicotine Patch for Dementia?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&lt;/strong&gt; My brother is approaching 81 and is having difficulties with his memory. His doctor has prescribed donepezil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, investigation on drugs that help with dementia and Alzheimer’s is inconclusive. I have been reading more and more about the nicotine patch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have great respect for your opinion. What are your thoughts about the nicotine patch? Are there any clinical trials that might establish effectiveness?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a family history. Our mother and many of her siblings died from Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; You have asked a fascinating question. We have known for years that nicotine patches might have a beneficial effect on memory (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14534771/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;, Feb. 2004&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Here is the scientists’ introduction:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic transdermal nicotine has been found to improve attentional performance in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but little is known about chronic nicotine effects in age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), a milder form of cognitive dysfunction. The current study was performed to determine the clinical and neuropsychological effects of chronic transdermal nicotine in AAMI subjects over a 4-week period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a small study of people with age-associated memory impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions Regarding the Nicotine Patch:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic transdermal nicotine treatment in AAMI subjects caused a sustained improvement in clinical symptoms and objective computerized tests of attention. These results support the further investigation of nicotinic treatment as a promising therapy for AAMI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More Nicotine Patch Research:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;In 2013 Finnish researchers pointed out that (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24069634/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duodecim&lt;/em&gt;, 2013&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“even a noxious substance may possess beneficial properties”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;They too reported that a nicotine patch could improve symptoms of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Other pilot studies have reinforced some benefit from nicotine patch treatment (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22232050/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, Jan. 10, 2012&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study found that transdermal nicotine over 6 months is a safe treatment for nonsmoking subjects with MCI [mild cognitive impairment]. As this was a pilot clinical trial, we wanted to measure a broad number of cognitive and behavioral domains which might be influenced by nicotinic stimulation. Thus, it is not surprising that some measures showed no effect of treatment. However, measures of attentional, memory, and psychomotor performance did show an effect of nicotine and this finding provides strong justification for further treatment studies of nicotine for patients with early evidence of cognitive dysfunction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The MIND Clinical Trial:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been waiting a long time for a large nicotine patch study to be conducted. Let’s face it, the patch is a relatively inexpensive pharmaceutical product that can be purchased over the counter to help people quit smoking. Drug companies like big ticket products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first big study of nicotine patches for patients with mild cognitive impairment is called &lt;strong&gt;MIND&lt;/strong&gt; (Memory Improvement Through Nicotine Dosing). This clinical trial should be completed this year. We look forward to learning the results. When they are announced, we will do our best to make them available to you in a timely manner. Until then, though, we cannot recommend this approach. Anyone contemplating such an approach must discuss it with a physician. Nicotine could interact with other prescribed medications for AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used the nicotine patch to quit smoking? Please share your experience in the comment section below.

The first symptom was that I couldn't wee – no matter how hard I tried and then, despite drinking water regularly, sitting in the bath for prolonged periods of time and listening to the sound of running water, I was unable to go," Gray told &lt;em&gt;Metro&lt;/em&gt;. "This went on for five days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray said they struggled to provide alternative solutions despite informing her doctors that laxatives were ineffective. "It was difficult to get doctors to believe me," she added. "They said that I must have been able to go to the toilet and that I was probably misremembering things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She experienced severe bladder pain as her condition worsened and returned to the doctor. Scans revealed her bladder contained a liter of urine, about four times its maximum capacity. Doctors inserted a catheter to relieve the pain, which Gray described as feeling like she was "being stabbed in the bladder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray made numerous hospital visits over the following months to relieve her bladder with a catheter, as she remained unable to urinate. After advocating for further tests, she was diagnosed with Fowler's syndrome in October 2019. This rare disorder affects the urethral sphincter, preventing it from relaxing and causing urinary retention, bladder spasms and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors informed Gray that her bladder showed no activity and would likely "never work normally again." "I was told there was nothing they could do and I would need a catheter for life," she told Southwest News Service, via the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;. "I think I went through a process of grieving to begin with, because it was so unknown. But it was a relief to know that it wasn’t all in my head."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray learned to self-catheterize five times a day to manually relieve her bladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 23:30:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>研究发现， CT扫描可能导致5%的癌症；专家指出不确定性- Ars Technica | CT scans could cause 5% of cancers, study finds; experts note uncertainty - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNank5V2ZFeVZHek1HLWFKWUpGSGx1UEhKekJQVDJzUjdOSU1yQ2loblNRS2Q4UUIzQlRjaTJoN3cwNTJjWDZXc1dZaFU4eXdiaXlhb0NPUFBiVFRnNXJMS2I4Vm1YZUkxNWc3a2pRQlF4Y3dIR3Q0di16MWMxcThfQm15blVJR3hhQlQxUThSVURpM3ZXLXlNU1RzMUxreFpwaUJrcEUwaTRHZUVzTlpB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;h2&gt;Uncertainty and balancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The estimates, while based on the best models available to the authors, are indirect, so there is considerable uncertainty about the estimates," Stephen Duffy, emeritus professor of Cancer Screening at Queen Mary University of London, said in a statement. "Thus, I would say to patients that if you are recommended to have a CT scan, it would be wise to do so."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duffy also highlighted that in the context of a person's overall risk of cancer, CT scans don't move the needle much. There were a little over 100,000 cancers linked to 93 million scans. "This amounts to around a 0.1 percent increase in cancer risk over the patient's lifetime per CT examination," he said. The lifetime risk of cancer in the US population is &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer.html"&gt;around 40 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the additional risk from CT scans "is small." Overall, when a CT scan is deemed necessary, the "likely benefit in diagnosis and subsequent treatment of disease outweighs the very small increase in cancer risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doreen Lau, a cancer biology expert at Brunel University of London, agreed: "The findings don’t mean that people should avoid CT scans when recommended by a doctor. In most cases, the benefit of detecting or ruling out serious illness far outweighs the very small risk of harm."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the rise in CT scans in recent years may suggest that doctors could cut back on their use. In &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832782"&gt;an accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Ilana Richman of Yale University and Mitchell Katz of NYC Health and Hospitals discussed ways that doctors could make sure they're balancing risks and benefits before using CT scans, including using diagnostic algorithms and offering alternative imaging options, such as ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As with all complex problems, there will be no simple solution," they write. But, "educating clinicians about avoiding low-value testing and, in circumstances where alternatives are readily available, involving patients in the decision to do a CT scan may help shift culture and practice."&lt;/p&gt;
