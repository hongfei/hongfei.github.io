&lt;h2&gt;Key Facts&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas Department of State Health Services &lt;a href="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-25-2025" aria-label="reported"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its outbreak had grown to 198 cases of measles as of Friday, with 23 of the patients having been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Texas health department said just five of the cases are in vaccinated people, with the remainder of the sick patients being unvaccinated (80) or having an unknown vaccination status (113).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the New Mexico Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188" aria-label="said"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; a deceased man in Lea County who was unvaccinated against measles tested positive for the virus, though they said he did not seek medical care before passing and “the official cause of death is still under investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class="key-facts-element"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lea County, New Mexico, is home to all 30 of the state’s confirmed measles cases, and is about 47 miles from Gaines County, Texas, where the majority of Texas’ measles cases have been detected.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Where In Texas Is The Measles Outbreak?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some 137 of the measles cases are located in Gaines County, a rural area about an hour-and-a-half west of Lubbock. The remaining cases are in Terry County (29), Dawson County (9), Yoakum County (8), Dallam County (5), Martin County (3), Lubbock County (3), Ector County (2) and Lynn County (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Age Groups Is The Measles Outbreak Impacting In Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-nine of the cases have been among people aged five to 17, while 64 cases were among children between the ages of zero and four and 34 were reported among adults over age 18. The ages of 11 patients have not been stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;/fbs-ad&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Are There Outbreaks In Other States?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is an outbreak in New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" aria-label="30 cases"&gt;30 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Lea County, which is on the border with Texas. Outside of Texas and New Mexico, anywhere from one to nine cases have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="reported by the CDC"&gt;reported by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; in California, Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Are Measles Symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a fever, rash, cough, fatigue, runny nose and red eyes. The symptoms do not appear until 10 to 14 days after someone is exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;How Contagious Is Measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious and can spread from one person to nine out of 10 people close to them, according to the CDC, which notes a person infected with measles can spread it to others four days before through four days after the rash appears. Measles can spread through coughing, sneezing and infected surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Is There A Measles Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, and it is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html#:~:text=MMR%20is%20safe%20and%20effective,especially%20if%20planning%20to%20travel." aria-label="highly effective and safe"&gt;highly effective and safe&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC. The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which has been available for over half a century, is about 97% effective at preventing measles with the standard two doses and 93% effective with one dose. The vaccine is typically given to people when they are children, with one dose administered between 12 to 15 months and another administered between four to six years old. The vaccine generally provides long-term or lifelong protection. There is no problem with getting the vaccine if you are an adult unsure of their vaccination status, Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" aria-label="NPR"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;. Adults born after 1957 and vaccinated before 1968 should consider getting revaccinated, NPR reported, noting early measles vaccines are not as effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;What Has Rfk Jr. Said About The Measles Outbreak And Vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After claiming the outbreak is “not unusual,” Kennedy changed his stance and considered it “serious,” saying in a March 3 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html" aria-label="statement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; “the measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/17/health/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines.html" aria-label="vaccine skeptic"&gt;vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, said vaccines contribute to community immunity, but did not explicitly tell people to get vaccinated and noted the “the decision to vaccinate is a personal one.” He also supported the use of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician to treat people with mild, moderate, and severe infection, creating concerns among health experts who have cautioned about the vitamin’s effectiveness. Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-vitamin-a-concerns/" aria-label="The Washington Post"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that solely relying on vitamin A instead of the MMR vaccine is “dangerous and ineffective” and can put children at risk, noting too much vitamin A can “cause serious health problems, including liver damage.” Meanwhile, advocacy non-profit Children’s Health Defense, which was founded and once chaired by RFK Jr., has attacked the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1897089684725006488" aria-label="quoted skeptics"&gt;quoted skeptics&lt;/a&gt; who claimed measles was “an insignificant inconvenience until we turned it into a literal neurological damage nightmare through the MMR vaccine campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Crucial Quote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to the highly contagious nature of this disease, additional cases are likely to occur in the outbreak area and the surrounding communities,” according to The Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed color-accent bg-base font-accent font-size text-align"&gt;Key Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles outbreak began in late January with just two cases and has become the state’s largest outbreak of the virus in 30 years. The Texas Department of State Health Services said in a &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_Annual_Report_of_Immunization_Status_of_Students.pdf" aria-label="report"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of student immunization status for the 2023-2024 school year that 5.64% of Texas kindergarten students were not vaccinated for measles, while 2.34% of seventh graders had not received the vaccine. Measles was fully eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="color-link" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" aria-label="CDC"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, meaning the virus was not spreading within the country and new cases only came from people who contracted measles abroad and returned to the U.S. In 2024, a total of 285 measles cases were reported across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;SEMINOLE, Texas – Last Saturday, Zach Holbrooks walked into a mobile measles screening and vaccine clinic he had helped set up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://southplainshealth.org/" target="_blank"&gt;South Plains Public Health District&lt;/a&gt;, which includes Gaines County, he dropped by to check on how many shots the crew had given out so far that day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Has it been busy today?" Holbrooks asked the two staffers in what's normally a livestock show barn on the outskirts of downtown Seminole. "Not so far. We've only given one," they replied.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks works and lives in this town, the county seat, which in the last few weeks became the epicenter of the largest measles outbreak in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, March 4, one 6-year-old unvaccinated child had died of the measles. There are now &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;159 confirmed cases and 22 hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;, but local health authorities say the true total is likely much higher.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says outbreaks tend to occur when the vaccination rate&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxPawOGro$" target="_blank"&gt; in a community dips below 95%&lt;/a&gt;. The kindergarten vaccination rate for measles, mumps and rubella on record in Gaines County sits at 82%, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank"&gt;state health records&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But many children there are homeschooled or attend private primary school, so those rates could be even lower.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks has been busy since the outbreak started in late January. He's been setting up mobile testing and vaccination sites; he said this remote part of West Texas has a large immigrant population, many whose immunization records are unknown, so he's been circulating flyers with measles information in different languages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a mix of people out here, a large German speaking population, Spanish speaking population," which he said makes getting residents the right information about disease control even more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Authorities still don't know how the measles got to Seminole, but John Belcher, the town's former mayor, said he understands why it's spreading beyond the city limits.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Folks who live out here basically have to drive everywhere, he said. They hop in the car or truck and drive miles to get groceries, go to doctor's appointments, attend church and to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'd say within 200 miles, maybe even farther, if there's a metal building out there, it came from products manufactured in Gaines County," Belcher said. "And the building was probably put together by companies from Gaines County."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People here need to drive about 80 miles to catch a flight at the Lubbock Airport.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others travel often to nearby communities in Lea County, on the New Mexico side of the state line. That state has &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/__;!!Iwwt!WOht7WM-b65xhcncf6ZyqjlBqbKTRaIxWB-NlqKDVH0JWldhrMa3FkN8ikXMnavEP7uPA4dFvFvxrvRiLIE$" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 10 confirmed measles cases. On Thursday, New Mexico Health officials confirmed that an unvaccinated adult testing positive for the virus has died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-52432" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A sense of normalcy&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Seminole, the outbreak has mainly infected children since early January.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Local authorities say the Mennonite community has been hit hard by measles, though they don't have an exact number of confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Grub Shack, a restaurant owned and run by a Mennonite family, seems to be running at full steam. Other businesses in downtown Seminole and people just carry on with their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many Mennonites immigrated here in the late 1970s. There remain thousands of Mennonites in Seminole some 50 years later.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tina Siemens' father moved his family here from northern Mexico in 1976 when she was 8. She was raised Mennonite and manages the &lt;a href="https://wtlhm.com/" target="_blank"&gt;West Texas Living Heritage Museum&lt;/a&gt;, which tells the history of this part of West Texas' Native American and Mennonite heritage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While many Mennonites are not against vaccines in principle, Siemens said, some seek other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The Mennonites are very keen on home remedies," Siemens said. "So there may be a family that, nobody knows that they might have all had the measles."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The state's health officials have said there's plenty of vaccine for everyone who needs it, and Holbrooks said he doesn't think it's a lack of access to the vaccine that's spreading measles out here.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At last count, 214 people in Gaines County have been vaccinated for measles since the outbreak. Holbrooks believes that number is not higher because some people fear debunked ideas about its safety.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I just think there's some vaccine hesitancy, even more so since COVID," Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-50709" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, the measles vaccine is safe and two doses prevent infection, not just severe illness, 97% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Julie Carter has lived in Seminole all her life. Her three kids are adults: 19, 22 and 30 years old. They got the measles vaccine before starting elementary school, but she became a vaccine skeptic when she started researching ways to improve her health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was overweight; I wasn't feeling good," Carter said. "I kind of went on a journey where I got educated. I came across the vaccine thing and wasn't sure how healthy those were."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health officials say doubts about vaccines continue to hamper vaccination efforts. Plus, this illness has not been a major public health issue. In 2000, the CDC declared the virus eliminated from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said that for a lot of younger parents, measles is a thing of the past.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not something that people thought a lot about," he said. But he's urging those in the community to do just that because the consequences can be severe. "If it was just a simple rash, a rash won't lead to brain inflammation, intellectual disability, death, pneumonia, deafness, convulsions."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And measles, one of the most contagious known viruses, can spread for days without a person feeling sick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
