&lt;p&gt;We rarely think about food in relation to our mental health. We worry about it leading to health issues, such as &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-heart-health_l_63e51cdfe4b0255caae9f325" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/worst-foods-for-digestion-health_l_6411d77ce4b0a3902d2e1014" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681"&gt;gastrointestinal&lt;/a&gt; problems, but did you know that different foods and beverages can exacerbate anxiety spikes and even bouts of depression? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are foods and drinks that therapists and psychiatrists, who have spent their careers advising people on mental wellness, typically avoid ― or consume in moderation ― for the sake of their mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take this knowledge with a grain of salt. These foods and drinks can be consumed once in a while and not be correlated with negative mental health consequences. Just remember that, as with everything, moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Cups Of Coffee Or Espresso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some people, too much caffeine can have a negative impact on anxiety. “If a person is prone to feeling anxious or has multiple stressors, know that over-caffeination causes an increased cortisol response and can lead to adrenal fatigue, a recipe for persistent stress and burnout, not to mention sleep issues,” said licensed clinical psychologist &lt;a href="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=64667c76e4b035573934d585&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fdrbrittneyjones%2F" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Brittney Jones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668773/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that consuming more than 250 milligrams of caffeine per day (that’s roughly 2 1/2 cups) could have a negative impact on anxiety, so Jones does her best to keep her coffee consumption under that amount. And for people who get jitters or anxiety spikes from coffee, consuming caffeine in the form of matcha can be a great alternative since it gives many people a feeling of calm alertness &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28056735/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;thanks to a compound called L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet Soda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking out for your mental health this summer, you might want to keep your diet soda consumption to a minimum. “Everyone loves a cold diet soda on a warm summer day, but the health concerns outweigh the benefits,” said &lt;a href="https://www.sohomd.com/psychiatrist-dr-jospitre" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Jacques Jospitre, Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified psychiatrist and co-founder of SohoMD. “While we know high-sugar sodas aren’t great for our health, diet sodas might actually be even worse. Many of these contain phenylalanine, which is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28198207/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;an added chemical well-known to mess up brain neurochemistry&lt;/a&gt; by stopping the proper production of serotonin and dopamine, two molecules we need for good mood.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these drinks have artificial sweeteners like aspartame, “which is a known neurotoxin and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1028415X.2017.1288340#:~:text=Aspartame%20acts%20as%20a%20chemical,adverse%20effects%20on%20neurobehavioral%20health." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;may raise stress hormones like cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, as well as increase the amount of free radicals in the brain,” Jospitre said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a drink or two once in a while isn’t the worst thing, &lt;a href="https://www.livebettertherapysolutions.com/about" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7862681" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Danielle Tucci&lt;/a&gt;, a licensed professional counselor and the founder of Live Better Therapy Solutions, said she does her best to avoid alcohol when considering her mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

Most people die within a year once symptoms occur, according to the CDC. One of the CJD cases was confirmed through an autopsy, while the other two are considered presumptive diagnoses, &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/health/2025/04/2-in-oregon-die-of-rare-brain-disease.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;the Oregonian &lt;/a&gt;reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trish Elliott, the director of the Hood River County Health Department, told the outlet that presumptive cases can only be confirmed after death through the testing of brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid. It’s a process that can take several months and must be done out of state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this time, there is no identifiable link between these three cases,” the health department said in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CJD affects approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/creutzfeldt-jakob/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=Key%20points,55%20years%20old%20and%20older." data-link="native" class=""&gt;one to two people&lt;/a&gt; per million globally each year.

            Colombia’s health ministry declared a nationwide health emergency on Thursday due to the “active circulation” of yellow fever.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0002356qhkd5ab7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since September 2024, there have been 75 recorded cases of yellow fever and 34 deaths from the illness, according to the Colombian Health Ministry.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0003356q2z69kpqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nine of the country’s 32 departments have reported at least one case of yellow fever. Most were detected in rural areas of the Tolima and Meta departments, the Amazon basin, and the Magdalena River region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0004356qiu9ijh46@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases have also been reported in areas where the virus has not been historically located, such as the coffee-growing Caldas region, according to the president’s office.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0005356q3p3onppr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some regions were already under alert before it was extended nationwide due to the expected surge in travel during Easter weekend. Travel to some zones with a critical virus presence will also be restricted under the health emergency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nawztv0000356q5dho4m10@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yellow fever is a disease that is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nb6q6i000r356qr55jrhbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many people do not experience symptoms from the disease, while others experience fever, muscle pain, headache, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever" target="_blank"&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to the WHO. In most cases, symptoms disappear after three to four days.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nb6q6i000s356qumns0bf1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, some patients enter a second phase of illness in which they develop jaundice and abdominal pain, among other symptoms. Half the patients who enter this phase die within seven to 10 days, according to the WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nb6q6i000t356qijatq75b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific anti-viral drug treatment for yellow fever; the WHO advises that patients rest, stay hydrated, and seek medical attention as needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0006356q608zid5t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The office of President Gustavo Petro urged Colombians to receive the single-dose vaccine, which is free and can be administered to anyone older than nine months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0007356q8njbgg9f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medical teams would be deployed to administer vaccines in the affected areas, the office announced.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59t0008356qwca1ajnx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In two months, the entire Colombian population must be vaccinated against yellow fever,” Petro said on X. “We must do this, and our health system must guarantee it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u0009356q0zyq86kj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Petro added that he would declare an economic emergency due to the situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u000a356qcv28tygl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Petro’s office said that the Ministry of Health and the National Health Institute have deployed more than 20 immediate response teams to investigate the spread of the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u000b356q9kx40fwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have already asked each territorial entity to have a hospital to which people suffering from the disease can go, so that we can exercise clear and definitive control over them from there,” Health Minister Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo stated to local media.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u000c356qt22snnp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some opposing political figures argued that the government’s response to the disease comes too late.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u000d356qs07fq088@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It is unacceptable for the government to declare a health and economic emergency for yellow fever when the crisis started six months ago,” said Senator Paloma Valencia from the Democratic Center party. “Decisions should have been made a long time ago to prevent deaths.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9nax59u000e356qqkn0uyu2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Petro will hold a broadcast cabinet meeting on emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus and release a new report on the progress of the disease on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rates of obesity are rising, and it seems like more people are trying specialized diets, particularly those that cut back on carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Currently, more than 40% of adults in the United States experience obesity, and while &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-for-dinner-for-weight-loss-11696366" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;many aim to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;, keeping that weight off remains a significant challenge as obesity rates continue to grow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the International Food Information Council, 43% of people believe carbohydrates or sugars are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024124/best-carb-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the main cause of weight gain&lt;/a&gt;. But only 25% of folks see calories from all sources as contributing to weight gain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, scientific studies suggest that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291554/30-day-low-carb-meal-plan-1200-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cutting carbs&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t offer significant weight loss benefits when the total number of calories consumed is the same.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And there are downsides to a low-carb diet, too—some research suggests that cutting back on carbohydrates can lead to inadequacies in key vitamins and minerals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To shed more light on those concerns, a group of researchers analyzed data to help figure out if adults on low-carb diets are missing out on some macronutrients and, if so, which ones. They published their work, which also includes insights about how fat may affect macronutrient intake, in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study relies on data collected as part of a large, ongoing health study called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), which is conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. These researchers focused on data from adults aged 20 years or older that was collected from 2007 to 2018, which resulted in just over 15,000 participants for the study. On average, the participants were 48 years old.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants in the study were divided into two main groups based on the percentage of calories they consumed from carbohydrates, which was determined based on food surveys that participants took. The first group included those with a carbohydrate intake of less than 45% of their total energy, referred to as the "restricted carbohydrate" group. The second group included those whose diets met established guidelines for carbohydrates (45% to 65% of energy), as well as for other nutrients like fats, protein and specific fatty acids. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Intake of certain nutrients, like vitamins A, B12, C, D and E, as well as folate, iron, calcium, magnesium and zinc, were assessed to see how many people might not be getting enough when following the lower carb dietary pattern. They also checked how many people consume too much sodium. The research analyzed what people get from food alone and, for most nutrients, also included supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To further understand the role of fats, the restricted carbohydrate group was split into smaller subgroups based on how much fat they consumed. These subgroups looked at total fat and the types of fat, such as monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fats to analyze intakes of certain nutrients. By analyzing these patterns, researchers aimed to identify connections between dietary intake and nutrient deficiencies across the population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Compared to the group that followed the recommended dietary ranges, those in the low-carb group were slightly less likely to be women, more likely to have finished college, and had a higher income compared to their household needs. The low-carb group consumed fewer carbohydrates but more protein, more fat and more alcohol compared to the recommended group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People following a diet low in carbohydrates were more likely to have too little of certain minerals and vitamins compared to those who followed a balanced diet that met all recommended intake ranges. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, the low-carb group was more likely to be deficient in:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Iron &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin A &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Folate &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin D &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the brighter side, the low-carb group was less likely to be deficient in zinc and vitamin B12. Those on a lower carb diet were likely to consume more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/choline-dementia-study-8779484" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt; than recommended, but they also ate more sodium than recommended.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When people following a low-carb diet were grouped by how much total fat they ate, further patterns emerged regarding their nutrient levels. For instance, those on a low-carb, low-fat diet were more likely to consume less calcium and vitamin E than recommended. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And different types of fat were linked to different intakes of certain nutrients as well. For example, the research team investigated how monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake affected nutrient levels in people on low-carb diets. They found that a low-carb, low-MUFA diet often led to overconsumption of sodium and underconsumption of vitamin E, while a high-MUFA diet supported healthy potassium intake. MUFAs are found in foods &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;like olive oil&lt;/a&gt; and avocado. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers also looked into similar relationships between some micronutrients and polyunsaturated fats and saturated fat, finding, for example, that a diet lower in saturated fat was more likely to support healthy calcium intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These findings suggest that the relationship between carbohydrate restriction and micronutrient inadequacy is dependent on the amount and type of fat intake, which has implications for clinical practice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to note a few limitations when considering this data. The information about food intake came from self-reports, which can sometimes be inaccurate due to personal bias or errors in recall. Additionally, participants were grouped into the carb-restricted category regardless of whether they were intentionally following this type of diet or not. Lastly, everyone with a carbohydrate intake below 45% of their total energy was grouped together, but it’s possible that varying levels of carbohydrate restriction could lead to different outcomes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those considering a low-carbohydrate diet, these findings highlight some practical takeaways that can guide healthier choices. While reducing carbohydrates might seem like a straightforward way to manage weight, it’s essential to understand the potential trade-offs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cutting back on carbs without carefully planning your diet can lead to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals like magnesium, vitamin C and folate. These nutrients play vital roles in energy production, immune function and overall health, so it’s crucial to make adjustments to ensure you’re not missing out on them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplementation can be a useful strategy to address nutrient gaps, especially for individuals following more restrictive diet plans. But it’s important to remember that supplementation isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. Consulting with a healthcare provider or a dietitian ensures personalized advice tailored to your specific diet, lifestyle and health needs. They can help assess whether supplements are necessary and recommend the right dosage to complement your diet safely and effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A balanced approach to low-carb eating can make all the difference. Incorporating diverse food groups, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds and lean proteins, can help mitigate the risk of nutrient deficiencies while still reaping the benefits of carbohydrate reduction. By paying attention to dietary quality and seeking professional input when needed, you can pursue your health goals while maintaining optimal nutrition and well-being.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&lt;/em&gt; highlights potential nutritional gaps among people who follow a low-carbohydrate diet. While many people turn to these diets to shed excess weight, it comes with potential downsides, including deficiencies in some vitamins, iron, magnesium and folate. Micronutrient deficiencies can compromise energy levels, immune support and long-term health outcomes. These risks emphasize the necessity of a well-structured diet (or even strategic supplementation) to avoid any nutritional gaps while following a low-carb lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, the takeaway is clear—diet quality matters just as much as diet quantity. For those choosing a low-carb approach, prioritizing nutrient-dense foods is essential to ensure proper health and functionality. This might mean incorporating foods like spinach, avocados, nuts, and berries, which can supply vital vitamins and minerals typically missing from low-carb meal plans. By making informed adjustments, consulting with health professionals and tailoring dietary choices to individual needs, those pursuing low-carb diets can achieve more sustainable and healthful outcomes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9n89vu6002i3575frujrgl5@published"&gt;I divorced my children’s dad for a “bad” reason in their minds, and they are so angry, and I’m not sure how to work through it with them. My kids are 18 and 20, and in college. In their narrative (and their dad’s), I filed for divorce the instant the youngest went to college because I hated their grandma and wanted her to die alone. To me, it’s more complicated. In 2023, my MIL moved in with us for emergency caregiving for Alzheimer’s. She and my husband weren’t close. He was a surprise youngest kid and she openly resented him for it in childhood, although she apologized a few years ago. It seemed like he was trying to make it up to her by taking her in. His older siblings suggested a nursing home, and offered to help arrange it. She could afford it, even. Instead, he moved her in without consulting me, and she needed a lot of help. She could be pretty mean even before the dementia removed her filter, so once that happened, things really deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9n81g1f00132xksu3l3rbuc@published"&gt;After two years of burnout, anger, and exhaustion, I fell out of love. We had multiple conversations and even marriage counseling about the ways his unilateral decisions were hurting our marriage. The last straw was his refusal to the idea of a home health aide after she accidentally set a small fire and needed daytime supervision. Instead, he suggested I take FMLA (he’s already used his) or go part-time to stay home with her. I realized he wasn’t even trying to look out for his mom’s best interests, or mine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9n8a3xe002n3575yk95hb1w@published"&gt;I filed for divorce, and he immediately told our kids that it was because I hated Grandma and didn’t want to care for others. It hit on a painful point for me and the kids; I was the primary earner with long hours for all of their middle school years because their dad was unemployed. I never got to spend as much time with them as I wanted, and I know they resent that. So to them, it feels like more of the same. What can I do to make room for their pain but not get excommunicated?&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, that doesn’t stop your kids from being hurt over the divorce, but you aren’t responsible for their pain. Your children are young adults; they’re old enough to handle the truth about why you split from their father. Be honest with them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9n8a6gp002u3575dpb5mypl@published"&gt;Talk to them about what life was like with your MIL and their father’s refusal to get her the sort of help she needs. Acknowledge that the idea of you “refusing” to be around may be triggering because of their childhood experiences, but let them know you did everything within reason to make things work, until you simply couldn’t anymore. Be empathetic and let them know that you know the divorce hurts them; give them the space to express their grief while still standing up for yourself. It may take them some time to understand, but hopefully, they’ll come to respect the way you advocated for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than 60 years of genetic guessing, scientists have finally cracked the code behind what makes orange cats so… orange. In &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.19.624036v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two separate studies&lt;/a&gt; published on&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.21.624608v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have identified a specific &lt;strong&gt;DNA deletion&lt;/strong&gt; on the X chromosome that turns a regular cat into a fiery feline. The discovery sheds new light on how genetics drive fur color—and why orange cats are almost always male.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Secret Sits In Silent DNA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The culprit isn’t a mutation in a typical gene that codes for pigment. Instead, the answer lies in a &lt;strong&gt;non-coding region&lt;/strong&gt;—a stretch of &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/new-dna-study-reveals-neanderthals-survived-interbred-modern-humans/" data-type="post" data-id="73229"&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; that doesn’t build proteins but controls how genes behave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that orange cats have a &lt;strong&gt;5,000-base-pair deletion&lt;/strong&gt; just before a gene called &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt;. This deletion causes the gene to become overactive, especially in &lt;strong&gt;melanocytes&lt;/strong&gt;, the pigment-producing &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/after-death-a-new-life-takes-shape-scientists-astonishing-discovery-about-our-cells/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; in skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/how-do-cats-actually-sleep/" data-type="post" data-id="72001"&gt;Cats&lt;/a&gt; with this deletion produce more &lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; RNA—up to &lt;strong&gt;13 times more&lt;/strong&gt; than cats without it. That overactivity shifts their fur color from dark black-brown to the reddish-gold we associate with marmalade cats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How The X Chromosome Shapes A Cat’s Coat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The orange gene sits on the &lt;strong&gt;X chromosome&lt;/strong&gt;, which helps explain one of the biggest quirks of orange cats: why most of them are male.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Male cats only have one X chromosome. If they inherit the version with the orange gene, they become fully orange. Female cats, on the other hand, have &lt;strong&gt;two X chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;—one from each parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In female cats, one X chromosome randomly turns off in each cell. That leads to a &lt;strong&gt;patchwork of fur colors&lt;/strong&gt;, often creating tortoiseshell or calico coats. Only if a female inherits two copies of the orange gene will she&lt;strong&gt; turn out completely orange&lt;/strong&gt;—a rare event.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s Really Behind Calicos And Tortoiseshells?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calicos&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tortoiseshell cats&lt;/strong&gt; are genetic mosaics, and the orange gene plays a major role in that. But there’s another twist: a &lt;strong&gt;white-spotting gene&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tortoiseshell cats have intermingled patches of black and orange. Calicos have larger color blocks separated by white fur. That white comes from a gene that affects how pigment cells &lt;strong&gt;migrate and survive&lt;/strong&gt; as the kitten develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;So even when the orange gene is present, its visual effect depends on how these other pigment genes behave.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are Orange Cats Really “Goofy”?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The internet loves to joke that orange cats are lovable but a little less sharp. And while orange tabbies have a reputation for being clingy, chaotic, or not-so-bright, there’s &lt;strong&gt;no science&lt;/strong&gt; to back that up.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ARHGAP36" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arhgap36&lt;/em&gt; gene&lt;/a&gt; has known roles in development, but in cats, it seems to only activate in skin pigment cells—not the brain. That means orange fur isn’t linked to intelligence or behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Still, human perception plays a big role. Because orange cats are so visually distinct, we might be more likely to &lt;strong&gt;assign personalities&lt;/strong&gt; to them—whether or not those traits are real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Chapter In Feline Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These new studies don’t just solve a long-standing mystery—they mark a &lt;strong&gt;turning point&lt;/strong&gt; in how scientists understand non-coding DNA. For decades, researchers focused mostly on protein-coding genes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, this discovery shows how even the &lt;strong&gt;“quiet” parts of the genome &lt;/strong&gt;can have big effects. And there may be more to uncover. Orange fur was just the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

In its update, the CDC said 94% of cases this year are part outbreaks, which have reached 10 now—3 more than the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of all US states have reported cases, some of which are linked to international travel. Among illnesses reported so far, 96% of patients were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. So far, 85 patients (11%) were hospitalized, with the number of deaths remaining at 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Texas nears 600 infections&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the main outbreak hot spot, the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS) today &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 36 more cases since April 15, boosting the state's total to 597, of which 371 are from Gaines County, though 24 other counties have also reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its list of other measles cases, the TDSHS reported 15 case-patients from Upshur County in the eastern part of the state, 2 of whom are Upshur County residents. Officials are examining the residency status of the other patients to determine if the cases are linked to the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks in New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma have also been linked to the West Texas outbreak. The &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Data"&gt;Kansas Department of Health and Environment&lt;/a&gt; this week reported 5 more cases, bringing its total to 37 infections in eight counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Michigan reports outbreak, Montana reports cases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Mid-Michigan District Health Department &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/inside-mdhhs/newsroom/2025/04/17/measles-outbreak"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the state's first measles outbreak since 2019, which involves three cases from Montcalm County in the western part of the state. Official added that the outbreak was initially linked to a large ongoing outbreak in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other outbreak developments, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.healthygallatin.org/community-health/communicable-diseases/measles/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the state's first measles cases since 1990. Officials said they are investigating five cases, which include children and adults living in Gallatin County who were exposed to measles while traveling outside of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All were unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status. Officials said the patients are isolating at home and that so far two potential public exposure sites in Belgrade and Bozeman have been identified. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their study, Gaby et al. organized an on-campus "Speed-Friending" event for 40 female volunteers, consisting of four distinct phases. First, participants had their headshots taken. Next, they looked at pictures of all the other women participating and rated friendship potential based solely on visual cues. Then the women wore a T-shirt for 12 hours as they went about their daily activities, which were then collected and placed in plastic bags. Finally, participants rated the friendship potential of anonymized participants based solely on smelling each T-shirt, followed by a live session during which they interacted with each woman for four minutes and rated their friendship potential. This was followed by a second round of smelling the T-shirts and once again rating friendship potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results: There was a strong correlation between the in-person evaluations of friendship potential and those based solely on smelling the T-shirts, with remarkable consistency. And the ratings made after live interactions accurately predicted changes in the assessments made in the final round of odor-based testing, suggesting a learned response element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Everybody showed they had a consistent signature of what they liked,” &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/04/finding-friendship-first-whiff"&gt;said co-author Vivian Zayas&lt;/a&gt; of Cornell University. “And the consistency was not that, in the group, one person smelled really bad and one person smelled really good. No, it was idiosyncratic. I might like person A over B over C based on scent, and this pattern predicts who I end up liking in the chat. People take a lot in when they’re meeting face to face. But scent—which people are registering at some level, though probably not consciously—forecasts whether you end up liking this person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors acknowledged that their study was limited to college-aged heterosexual women and that there could be differences in how olfactory and other cues function in other groups: older or younger women, non-American women, men, and so forth. "Future studies might consider a wider age range, investigate individuals at different stages of development, focus on how these cues function in male-male platonic interactions, or examine how scent in daily interactions shapes friendship judgments in other cultures," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

				Rice, the world's most consumed grain, will &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/climate-change-will-make-rice-toxic-say-researchers/"&gt;become increasingly toxic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; as the atmosphere heats and as carbon dioxide emissions rise, potentially putting billions of people at risk of cancers and other diseases, according to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(25)00055-5/fulltext"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published this week in The Lancet. From a report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Eaten every day by billions of people and grown across the globe, rice is arguably the planet's most important staple crop, with half the world's population relying on it for the majority of its food needs, especially in developing countries.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

But the way rice is grown -- mostly submerged in paddies -- and its highly porous texture mean it can absorb unusually high levels of arsenic, a potent carcinogenic toxin that is especially dangerous for babies.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt; After growing rice in controlled fields for six years, researchers from Columbia University and international partners found that when both temperature and CO2 increased in line with climate projections, arsenic levels in rice grains rose significantly. "When we put both of them together, then wow, that was really something we were not expecting," said Lewis Ziska, a plant physiologist at Columbia University who led the study. "You're looking at a crop staple that's consumed by a billion people every day, and any effect on toxicity is going to have a pretty damn large effect." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Inorganic arsenic exposure has been linked to cancers, heart disease, and neurological problems in infants. Disease risk rose across all seven top rice-consuming Asian countries analyzed. "This is one more reason to intervene -- to control people's exposure," said co-author Keeve Nachman of Johns Hopkins University. "The No. 1 thing we can do is everything in our power to slow climate change."

Its main chemicals, called cannabinoids, are THC and CBD. THC has a psychoactive effect. CBD does not, but can create a feeling of relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;State laws typically require legal dispensaries to disclose the amounts of THC and CBD in products, explains &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/psych-neuro/angela-bryan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Angela Bryan&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who studies the potential risks and benefits of cannabis use among older adults. These amounts are typically shown as a ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Regardless of whether someone wants to use cannabis recreationally or medicinally, the recommendation is to start low, go slow,” says Bryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-cannabis-affect-older-people-differently" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Does cannabis affect older people differently?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cannabinoids such as THC &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5877694/#:" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bind&lt;/a&gt; to receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system, leading to the drug’s effects. This system maintains homeostasis and regulates metabolism, but becomes less efficient with age, Bryan explains. As a result, cannabis is metabolized more slowly. That said, because people &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/nov/21/how-to-stay-healthy-in-your-50s-ageing" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;don’t age the same&lt;/a&gt;, there will be differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-nyoej5"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;If people experience relief, if they find a way to [use cannabis] that fits into their life and is safe, that is fantastic&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Angela Bryan, University of Colorado Boulder professor&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, THC can accumulate in fat. Because older adults tend to experience an increase in fat mass and a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/03/health-tips-70s-longevity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;decrease in muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, THC effects are more pronounced, explains Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Older adults often take multiple medications, so they should consult a healthcare provider before using cannabis, says Moore. Some data suggests people may not adjust prescription doses when adding cannabis, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1282831/full" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing the risk&lt;/a&gt; of harmful side effects like impaired cognition or increased anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cannabis has become &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/legal-pot-is-more-potent-than-ever-and-still-largely-unregulated/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more potent&lt;/a&gt; over the years. Bryan advises starting with low THC before trying stronger options. Low THC may also reduce reactions like paranoia and anxiety, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-risks-of-cannabis-use-for-older-adults" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the risks of cannabis use for older adults?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before using cannabis, discuss it with your doctor, says Moore. You can go over your medical history, including current and past medications, and why you want to try the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is little clarity on which cannabis products are most effective for specific medical needs, says &lt;a href="https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/profile/kaufmann-christopher/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Christopher Kaufmann&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine. He emphasizes the need for more research on cannabis use, specifically in older adults, who may face greater risks due to conditions like tachycardia and poor blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While there’s insufficient evidence for recommending cannabis, doctors can advise on potential benefits and risks. In older adults, common &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1064748120300828" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; like dizziness, drowsiness and confusion may increase &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/mar/31/falling-how-to-avoid-and-what-to-do" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fall risk&lt;/a&gt;, and cannabis could worsen cognitive impairment in those already affected, explains Dr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If patients already use cannabis, Moore asks them to bring it to their next appointment to review whether the dosage and method of administration are appropriate. Because products can be mislabeled, she emphasizes the importance of purchasing from licensed dispensaries, where accuracy is more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Certain forms may suit specific needs better, says Bryan. For instance, smoked products offer faster relief than edibles, making them preferable for immediate pain. But if you have a history of lung disease, avoid vaping and smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A downside of edibles is that you can’t undo overconsumption. “People tend not to oversmoke,” Bryan says. “They feel the effect they want and stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-23" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Three-quarters of participants found it “somewhat” or “extremely” helpful. While such use is common, scientific evidence supporting these health benefits is limited. Research is stronger on cannabis’s &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/cannabis-marijuana-and-cannabinoids-what-you-need-to-know" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; for neuropathic pain, spasticity and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="dc3bf3f1-527a-446f-93b1-4941b1b46ba0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":26,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Falling can be risky.

Bryan calls for more double-blind randomized controlled trials using legal cannabis products, though these are challenging to conduct because of the tightly regulated schedule I status of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Self-reported benefits still matter, Bryan says, even if there’s a placebo effect. “If people experience relief, if they find a way to do it that fits into their life and is safe for them, then that is fantastic,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moore thinks cannabis has “the potential to address some of the common issues we see with ageing”, but the barriers to studying it have impeded progress. Because short-term use of cannabis &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306460321004068" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;may improve&lt;/a&gt; positive mood, this might explain why people find it helpful, regardless of whether cause and effect can be validated, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aarongreensteinmd.com/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Aaron Greenstein&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified geriatric psychiatrist, says patients inquire about cannabis for sleep, pain and general wellbeing. But whether it’s helpful, and how much, can be very subjective, he says, and he’s observed that most of his patients who have hoped cannabis could help with wellbeing end up not sticking with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Part of the fascination with marijuana is that it is advertised as a quick fix,” he says. “But there’s a limit to how effective it can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-cannabis-help-older-adults-sleep-better" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Can cannabis help older adults sleep better?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a 2020 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7572650/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on people aged 21 to 70, Bryan and colleagues found that frequent use of edibles for sleep was linked to poorer sleep over time. She notes this pattern mirrors findings on other sleep aids: they work initially but lose effectiveness eventually. Sparing, as-needed use is generally more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study also found participants, especially older adults, slept better with higher CBD intake. While products with more THC may offer short-term relief, those with high-dose CBD and low-dose THC were better for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A combination of occasional CBD use along with some behavioral changes is probably the best recommendation” for people experiencing persistent, disruptive sleep problems, says Bryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moore has come across seniors who want to transition from hypnotic medications, like Ambien, to cannabis. But there’s a lack of data comparing the two, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When it comes to improving sleep, there are often more effective alternatives to cannabis and medications such as Ambien, says Lachs. These include options like gabapentin and melatonin, but he particularly recommends behavioral interventions like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/sep/23/cbt-i-sleep-therapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CBT-I&lt;/a&gt;, or cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Ultimately, “the jury is still out on whether cannabis can be used to treat sleep”, says Kaufmann. “There definitely needs to be more studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNb3lONU81eTBzUzZMekRLRHNXOFVKME92V1paSjBuejhONFZuTVBZTm5UMURzNG0wVmJrRzJoNEJpM01IWExEZkZlSllPSXRVb0g4R0doYkhUbVppbG1taVQ1MGNBNnhyekVFV190RXdyMWVnYS1hNk1keWswbU9BWHpSSlpBemZTdktwYg</guid></item><item><title>国际空间站正处于“其存在的最危险时期” ，美国宇航局安全小组警告- Gizmodo | The ISS Is in the ‘Riskiest Period of Its Existence,’ NASA Safety Panel Warns - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPSGp3Q0M4cWJpY0VBWXlXWDBvUUxINHhxdU5idDAybzNnaFA0VzZPaDhld3V1QVlzM0F6VDR0anpDZEE2dVNwTmNobHQ4VU1DUHFvMFl0QldkSlNQY2RtZXRYdVBwMDZIdnVxYjdUeGlybzBMSnI1V2N0anVaeWhRNnlob0RxUFVJbHR2d0paZEw1U09ybnRIVko0Sm9JczlYMEItaUJBb1U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;The International Space Station (ISS) has been orbiting Earth since 1998, housing groups of astronauts in the microgravity environment around 250 miles above the surface of the planet. All of that time in space has taken a toll on its aging hardware, and the space station is due to retire within the next few years. Until then, however, safety experts are warning of long-running issues that threaten the safety of the ISS, and the crew on board.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a meeting of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) held on Thursday, members of a NASA safety panel stated that there are growing risks threatening the space station as it nears the end of its use, SpaceNews &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-safety-panel-warns-of-increasing-risks-to-iss-operations/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. “The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence,” Rich Williams, a member of the panel, said during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the top of the list of growing risks is a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-iss-is-leaking-air-and-nasa-and-russia-cant-agree-why-2000524781"&gt;leak where air has been escaping at an increasing rate&lt;/a&gt; from a tunnel that connects a docking port to a Russian module. In 2019, Russia’s space agency Roscosmos reported the detection of an air leak found in the vestibule (named PrK) that connects a docking port to the Russian Zvezda module, which the space agency had launched to low Earth orbit in July 2000. The rate of air that has been leaking from Russia’s Zvezda module had doubled from one pound of air per day in 2019 to a little over two pounds around a week before the launch of the Progress MS-26 cargo spacecraft in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Both NASA and Roscosmos have been monitoring the air leak since then, and officials from the two space agencies are scheduled to meet later this month to update mitigation efforts for the growing safety concern, according to Williams. A report issued in late 2024 &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/growing-air-leak-in-russian-segment-now-deemed-greatest-iss-risk-report-reveals-2000505190"&gt;elevated the air leak to the highest level of risk&lt;/a&gt; based on its likelihood and severity. In the meantime, the source of the leak remains unknown. The astronauts on board the ISS are prepared to close the hatch to the service module when access is not required in order to minimize the amount of air lost, as well as to isolate the leak itself from the rest of the space station.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another safety issue addressed during the meeting is the lack of a deorbit plan for the ISS in case of an emergency. NASA is in the process of solidifying &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/an-excruciatingly-detailed-breakdown-of-how-nasa-plans-1851545016"&gt;a plan to ditch the nearly one-million pound space station in 2030&lt;/a&gt;, sending it flying through Earth’s atmosphere to mostly burn up from the heat, with its remaining bits ending up at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean in a controlled reentry. But as of now, NASA has no emergency plan in place to deorbit the ISS, and that’s a big problem. If NASA is forced to destroy the space station ahead of its retirement, then it increases the risk of ISS debris falling on inhabited areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the [U.S. Deorbit Vehicle] is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude,” Williams said, according to SpaceNews. &lt;/span&gt;The panel highlighted other issues with the ISS, including having enough spare parts for life support systems on board and delays with cargo deliveries. Williams blamed these issues on “ISS budget shortfall.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“As programs near final phases, it is tempting to assume less resources will need to be available,” Williams said. “For the ISS, it is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle is safely reentered.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A small Oregon county has been struck by one of the rarest but scariest ailments known to exist. Health officials in Hood River County have reported an unusual cluster of people coming down with Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three residents in the area have contracted CJD over the past eight months, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.hoodrivercounty.gov/index.asp?SEC=AF40862A-8B0E-4107-B2B4-956029C71941&amp;amp;DE=11E4744C-DDC6-4DBD-8F95-B86EFBB310E6"&gt;Hood River County Health Department&lt;/a&gt;, two of whom are already dead. Local and federal health officials are now investigating the cluster, but they have not identified a link between the cases to date.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/prions/about/index.html"&gt;CJD and similar brain diseases&lt;/a&gt; are caused by a misfolded version of the naturally occurring prion protein. When these rogue proteins come into contact with their harmless brethren, they convert them into more misfolded prions, acting almost like a zombie invasion. The accumulation of prions steadily destroys the brain, though it can take years or even decades for symptoms to appear. Once they do, however, death quickly follows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully for humanity, prion ailments are rare (other prion-like diseases might be &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-molecular-devils-that-cause-the-most-fatal-diseases-ever-known-2000511979"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt;). While CJD is the most common prion disease, only around 500 new cases of it are estimated to happen in the U.S. annually. This rarity makes three cases showing up so close together in the same relatively small county (roughly 24,000 people live in Hood River) all the weirder.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;CJD can broadly happen in three different ways. It can be passed down from mutations that make the emergence of prions inevitable. It can be transmitted, though usually only through rare scenarios such as close contact with infected brain tissue. Or it can simply occur sporadically for no clear reason.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most CJD cases fall in the last bucket. But over &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-happened-to-mad-cow-disease-history-prions-1851242160"&gt;thirty years ago&lt;/a&gt;, there was an outbreak of CJD caused by tainted cow meat (this specific form of CJD came to be known as variant CJD). As it turns out, the cows were infected with their own version of a prion disease—a condition formally called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, but more memorably known as mad cow disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mad cow/vCJD outbreak was contained by the mid-1990s, and only a few hundred people were ever sickened by prion-infected beef. But it showed that prion diseases can be more transmissible than we thought, and even today, scientists still worry about the possibility of similar events happening again. In North America, for instance, a prion disease has been steadily spreading among deer in recent years, though there is &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/prions-venison-deer-meat-brain-disease-mad-cow-guide-1851547274"&gt;no solid evidence yet&lt;/a&gt; that it poses a threat to people.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For that reason, anytime a cluster of CJD does appear, it tends to set off public health alarms. The bunching together of these cases in Hood River, Oregon—one confirmed, two suspected—might simply be pure, if unlucky, coincidence. But it remains important to rule out the scarier scenario. For now, there’s no immediate signs of something more being amiss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At this time, there is no identifiable link between these three cases,” the Hood River County Health Department said in its latest statement on the cluster, released Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The health department is still monitoring the situation, in conjunction with the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But as they rightly note, the general risk of CJD to the public is very low.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When you exercise before bed, it could result in you getting a bad night of sleep (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And when you exert energy, your body temperature rises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kaylor said that this can be a problem as a decline in core temperature is a critical signal to your body to initiate sleep.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If your body is still warm and alert from a late workout, it may take hours to return to a sleep-ready state,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you're thinking, 'Well, I'm exhausted after my workouts and fall asleep easily,' that actually doesn't necessarily mean you're getting good sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kaylor explained that even if you fall asleep shortly after an evening workout, there are still lingering elevations of adrenaline and cortisol in your body that can reduce the quality of your sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These hormones are actively working to give you less time in deep and REM stages of your sleep - something essential for physical recovery, memory processing, and emotional resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said when this happens, your sleep becomes lighter, more fragmented and less restorative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it's not just your body that remains active - it's your brain as well as there's a lot more mental engagement that goes into workouts than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Working out too close to your bedtime can make your sleep lighter, more fragmented, and less restorative (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Whether you're focused on your form, tracking your progress, or riding the emotional high of a new personal best, your brain may remain active long after your body stops moving,' Dr. Kaylor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So if you're someone who only has the time to work out after you're done with the workday, where does that leave you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For many people juggling work, family, and daily obligations, the only time available to exercise may be in the evening,' Dr. Kaylor said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In those cases, there are ways to reap the benefits of movement while minimizing sleep disruption.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;First, she explained that your best bet is to give yourself three hours between your workout and your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Kaylor also suggested 'exercise snacks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are short bursts of physical activity spread throughout the day rather than one long workout,' she dished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sleep expert Dr. Leah Kaylor said 'exercise snacks' - short bursts of physical activity spread throughout the day - can be an alternative to long, evening workouts &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that as long as you're getting 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week - even if it's done broken up into just 5-10 minutes at a time - you can still reap great health and sleep benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These micro-workouts provide flexibility, reduce the risk of overtraining, and are particularly useful for beginners, those recovering from injury, or anyone with a packed schedule,' the expert said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with this, she said that a proper wind-down routine at bedtime is essential to prepare your body for a good night's sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By making consistent, intentional choices, you can support your sleep, health, and fitness goals - without needing a perfect schedule or a full hour at the gym,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Myelin loss is common in disorders like multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, and this research shows that hnRNP A1 disruptions can impair myelination at the molecular level, even before behavioral symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a rodent model, scientists induced and later reversed demyelination to track the effects on memory, motor function, and social behavior. The findings offer fresh insight into how early molecular changes in myelin-related proteins could contribute to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, potentially opening new avenues for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Myelin Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruption of hnRNP A1 impairs myelin production and may play a role in schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent Molecular Shifts:&lt;/strong&gt; Changes in myelin-related proteins occurred without immediate behavioral symptoms, suggesting early markers of disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reversibility Observed:&lt;/strong&gt; Restoring myelin reversed behavioral deficits in rodents, underscoring therapeutic potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAPESP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurochemistry&lt;/em&gt; has detailed the role of a protein, hnRNP A1, in the formation and stability of myelin, suggesting an important impact on neurodegenerative diseases and mental disorders such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings pave the way for new research and potential treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myelin is a fatty substance produced by oligodendrocytes (cells of the central nervous system) that forms a sheath, like a kind of “insulator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It “protects” the extensions of neurons (axons) and increases the conduction speed of nerve impulses that carry information between neural cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific literature has shown that patients with multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia lose myelin (called demyelination), leaving part of the axons “unplugged” and causing damage to brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rodent study examined changes in proteins essential for myelin production (myelination). The results highlight the involvement of hnRNP A1 in maintaining the integrity of this protective sheath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hnRNP A1 regulates the processing of messenger RNA, i.e., it controls how the molecule is cut and assembled (splicing), thereby determining which proteins are produced and in what amounts. Studied for years by this group of scientists at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, hnRNP A1 had already figured prominently in previous research carried out on brain tissue from people with schizophrenia and on cells grown in the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I was a master’s student, I worked with oligodendrocyte predecessor cell lines and their responses to antipsychotics. This protein, hnRNP A1, always appeared. We decided to try to understand its role in oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But to do this, we had to use an animal model to induce myelination and understand the process,” explains Caroline Brandão Teles, first author of the article and FAPESP doctoral fellow at the Institute of Biology (IB-UNICAMP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For researcher Fernanda Crunfli, also from IB-UNICAMP and corresponding author of the paper, myelin has been an important target of study for neuropsychiatric diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to analyze the demyelination process in the animals and then restore the myelin sheath. This allowed for an interesting study window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did behavioral tests to assess locomotion, short- and long-term memory, and social interaction. When the myelin is restored, all these functions return to the brain,” says Crunfli, who was a FAPESP postdoctoral fellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teles points out that this was one of the results that caught the group’s attention – the fact that the changes were detected at the molecular level, without affecting the animals’ behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this molecular and non-behavioral alteration, the work has the interesting potential to pinpoint an important protein in the establishment of schizophrenia. This same animal model is analyzed in research on multiple sclerosis, for example, and when there’s a behavioral study, changes are noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the case of schizophrenia, the fact that the behavior isn’t altered indicates, in my opinion, that this protein is essential in the development of the disease and may have an influence on its genesis,” Professor Daniel Martins-de-Souza, from IB-UNICAMP, Teles’ supervisor and head of the Neuroproteomics Laboratory, told Agência FAPESP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by loss of contact with reality (psychosis), hallucinations, delusions, and impaired cognition, among other symptoms. The exact cause is still unknown, but recent research suggests a combination of hereditary factors and molecular and functional alterations in the brain. Treatment includes antipsychotic medications and psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that approximately 1.6 million people in Brazil have schizophrenia. Worldwide, the prevalence is about 1% of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Martins-de-Souza’s research group has been working to understand the role of oligodendrocytes in schizophrenia and has managed to map a series of brain proteins that help to unravel the molecular basis of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To understand the research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group used a rodent (murine) model that has also been studied in cases of multiple sclerosis, a disease characterized by severe demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the eighth week of the experiment, demyelination was induced and continued for another five weeks. The process was then interrupted and the myelin sheath was restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this time, the researchers analyzed the activity of hnRNP A1. “We saw that the proteins linked to myelin in these animals were all reduced. By disrupting the activity of this protein [&lt;em&gt;hnRNP A1&lt;/em&gt;], we ended up disrupting myelination,” says Teles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe that studying the impact of the protein’s alterations on synaptic transmission and cognitive processes could reveal new therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to the grants, the research was also supported by FAPESP through six other projects (17/25588-1, 19/05155-9, 18/01410-1, 23/08885-3, 18/01669-5 and 23/11514-7).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this schizophrenia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c647e696562697e784c6a6d7c697f7c226e7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Heloisa Reinert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://fapesp.br" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAPESP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Heloisa Reinert – FAPESP&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jnc.16304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impacts of hnRNP A1 Splicing Inhibition on the Brain Remyelination Proteome&lt;/a&gt;” by Caroline Brandão Teles et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurochemistry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impacts of hnRNP A1 Splicing Inhibition on the Brain Remyelination Proteome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells in the central nervous system, are implicated in several neurological disorders marked by dysfunctional RNA–binding proteins (RBPs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed at investigating the role of hnRNP A1 in the proteome of the corpus callosum, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus of a murine cuprizone–induced demyelination model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right after the cuprizone insult, we administered an hnRNP A1 splicing activity inhibitor and analyzed its impact on brain remyelination by nanoESI-LC-MS/MS label-free proteomic analysis to assess the biological processes affected in these brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant alterations in essential myelination proteins highlighted the involvement of hnRNP A1 in maintaining myelin integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathways related to sphingolipid and endocannabinoid signaling were affected, as well as the synaptic vesicle cycle and GABAergic synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although behavioral impairments were not observed, molecular changes suggest potential links to memory, synaptic function, and neurotransmission processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings enhance our understanding of the multifaceted roles of hnRNP A1 in the central nervous system, providing valuable insights for future investigations and therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative and demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Alongside the back pain, she developed a persistent cough, stomach issues, and strange bruises that refused to fade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, she chalked it up to fatigue and a lingering cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the time doctors took a closer look, it was too late. The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-26d04ad0-1c58-11f0-805a-97be76b02f96"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, quietly growing in her breast for years, had already spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests revealed it had reached both breasts, her spine, liver, and pelvis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s when doctors delivered the devastating news no young mother expects: she had just 18 to 24 months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kate Crawford was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at 28 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kate initially blamed her symptoms on being a busy mom of three young kids&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was 12 years ago, and against all odds, Kate, now 41, has survived stage 4 metastatic breast cancer and is on a mission to check things off her bucket list and make lasting memories with her husband and children.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She said she knows she will never be cured of cancer, but is 'thankful' to still be alive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kate is also determined to educate others on the lesser-known signs of cancer and teach them to advocate for themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Looking back, she realizes how her seemingly unrelated symptoms were all subtle signs of cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kate&lt;/span&gt; used to blamed her upset stomach on a bad diet and when the cough she had wouldn't go away after several months, she thought she 'was having trouble shaking a cold.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But these were all signs of cancer. I had no clue,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kate continued: 'I just thought I was tired because I was a new mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But it wasn't just exhaustion — I was bone-tired, with belly issues, a cough that lingered for months, and bruises that never went away.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'If the doctor had just done an x-ray, he would've seen I had cancer. One day, I was a 28-year-old mom of babies, and the next, I was being told I might not be here much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't know what to look for. If I had been more educated in the signs, I might have been able to better advocate for myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It may be too late for me, but it's not for you. If something doesn't feel right, please don't ignore it.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kate said: &lt;/span&gt;'I didn't know the signs. That's what I want people to take away from this. Know your body. Don't ignore your gut. It might just save your life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kate has undergone 200 cancer treatments, including a double mastectomy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kate said less than 13 percent of metastatic breast cancer patients survive as long as she has with the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her diagnosis of breast cancer, which affects about 317,000 women annually, she immediately started aggressive treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has had more than 200 treatments, including a double mastectomy, and has spent nearly a third of her life in a relentless battle for survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While treatable, metastatic breast cancer cannot be cured and about 42,000 women die of the disease each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The five-year survival rate for stage 4 breast cancer is 22 percent and Kate said less than 13 percent of metastatic breast cancer patients survive as long as she has with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At times her treatment has been far from straightforward. She has had allergic reactions, heart failure and even developed early-stage lung disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she has kept fighting, adapting her life around the three week treatment cycle and her changing body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'A stage 4 diagnosis means treatment for life and side effects for life. When one thing pops up, you just have to deal with it. Take it one step at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That time lets me relax and unwind. It reminds me to look for the glimmers.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kate credits her strength to survive to her husband Steve and their children, twins Grace and Lily, now 16, and Stephen, 15, who are constantly at her side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And she concentrates on small joys - from floating in a lake on a calm day, laughing with her kids, or discovering a new outfit that fits just right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;More than a decade after her diagnosis, Kate has adapted her life around the three week treatment cycle and her changing body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kate said: 'I just want to keep making memories with my family. That's all I've ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while she enjoys sharing her journey on social media, she warns against toxic positivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've never tried to sugarcoat my life, but people forget the daily struggles. We hide a lot, not for ourselves but to make others feel better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's ok to feel not ok. You don't always have to be the brave, stoic cancer patient. You can be mad, bitter, sad and still be full of love. That is perfectly ok. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kate continued: 'Getting diagnosed with cancer is like jumping into a big metaphorical lake full of other cancer patients. We're all in there together, but we can't help each other. We carefully tread water, but we get tired. Sometimes we barely hang on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People cheer from the shore. Some get rescued. Others stay. Some never make it out.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EAPs, also known as compassionate use programs, allow patients with serious or life-threatening conditions to access investigational therapies outside of clinical trials when no other alternatives are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing a greater number of patients with potentially lifesaving or life-extending treatment, EAPs offer opportunities to collect additional clinical data on experimental therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MN-166 program will enroll about 200 patients at &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/widetrial-manage-physician-network-ibudilast-eap/"&gt;several locations in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; who are not eligible for the ongoing &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04057898"&gt;COMBAT-ALS trial (NCT04057898)&lt;/a&gt;, including those with more advanced disease, to evaluate the therapy’s safety and efficacy in a broader patient population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), under the Accelerating Access to Critical Therapies for ALS Act (ACT for ALS). &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/landmark-act-for-als-act-president-biden/"&gt;ACT for ALS was signed&lt;/a&gt; into law in 2021 and provides $100 million annually through fiscal 2026 for efforts to improve ALS prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Targeting proteins to reduce inflammation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are honored to support this EAP trial, which will provide MN-166 to more individuals in advanced stages of ALS who are not eligible to our current Phase 2/3 COMBAT-ALS trial,” Yuichi Iwaki, MD, PhD, president and CEO at &lt;a href="https://medicinova.com/"&gt;Medicinova&lt;/a&gt;, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/04/08/3058062/7767/en/First-Patient-Enrolled-in-NIH-Funded-Expanded-Access-Program-EAP-Trial-to-Evaluate-MN-166-in-Amyotrophic-Lateral-Sclerosis-ALS-Patients.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ALS, the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movements, called motor neurons, become progressively damaged and die. The exact &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/causes-of-als/"&gt;causes of ALS&lt;/a&gt; remain unclear, but abnormal brain inflammation is thought to play a central role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MN-166 is an oral small molecule designed to reduce that inflammation and boost the survival and growth of nerve cells by targeting several different proteins involved in those processes. It is expected to slow the progression of ALS and potentially extend survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing Phase 2b/3 COMBAT-ALS trial is evaluating MN-166 in about 230 adults who began experiencing ALS symptoms up to 1.5 years before entering the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants are being given either MN-166 or a placebo twice daily for 12 months, after which all will be able to enter an optional, open-label extension and receive the experimental therapy for an additional six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/news/mn-166-ibudilast-slowing-als-progression-trial-data-suggest/"&gt;interim analysis&lt;/a&gt; from the first 217 patients, presented last year, suggested that MN-166 may slow ALS progression, extend survival, and reduce the decline in key physical functions. These include bulbar functions like speech and swallowing, fine motor skills such as writing, and gross motor abilities like walking or climbing stairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data remain blinded, meaning investigators don’t know which patients are receiving NM-166 and which are on a placebo, so more data will be needed to know for sure if the experimental therapy has an impact on those outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MN-166 has received orphan drug designation in the U.S. and European Union to treat ALS. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also granted it fast track designation. These designations are intended to support and expedite the development of promising treatments by offering incentives such as regulatory support, market exclusivity, and potential expedited review.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-blood-could-be-aging-your-brain-increasing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;global population ages&lt;/a&gt;, more of us face frightening cognitive decline, personally or in our loved ones. There are over &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;10 million new cases&lt;/a&gt; of dementia globally each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a study published last year suggests up to 13 percent of people diagnosed with dementia in the US may have a misdiagnosis and are instead left struggling with a condition that can be treated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Health care providers [must be] made aware of this potential overlap between dementia and hepatic encephalopathy, which is treatable," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/13-percent-of-patients-with-dementia-may-instead-have-cognitive-decline-from-cirrhosis"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Virginia Commonwealth University hepatologist Jasmohan Bajaj in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy"&gt;Hepatic encephalopathy&lt;/a&gt; – cognitive impairment caused by liver failure – impacts more than 40 percent of patients with advanced liver disease (&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487"&gt;cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;). The brain impairments it causes are hard to distinguish from dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/liver-anatomy-and-functions"&gt;Our livers regulate&lt;/a&gt; the levels of most chemicals in our bodies, from filtering them from the blood to aiding with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the well-known &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-reveals-what-happens-to-your-liver-when-you-quit-alcohol"&gt;liver-damaging effects of alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, other risks to the liver include the hepatitis  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="158513" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;, high cholesterol, obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="158513" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, stress, and aging. But if caught early enough and with the right treatment, damage to our livers can be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this can be mitigated through changes in diet and behavior, and there are even more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-024-00652-w"&gt;potential drug treatments&lt;/a&gt; on the horizon as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg" alt="An older woman with grey hair and glasses, talking on the phone" class="size-full wp-image-145448" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Up to 13 percent of people diagnosed with dementia in the US may have a misdiagnosis.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-024-00652-w"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; in mice suggests that even the impacts of aging on the liver may be reversible if caught early enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've shown that aging exacerbates non-alcoholic liver disease… and by reducing this impact, we can reverse the damage," &lt;a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/study-shows-how-liver-damage-stress-and-aging-might-be-reversible"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Duke University hepatologist Anna Mae. "You are never too old to get better."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.53965"&gt;In an earlier 2024 study&lt;/a&gt;, Bajaj and colleagues reviewed the medical records of 177,422 US veterans diagnosed with dementia between 2009 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of them had been diagnosed with liver disease, but the team found over 10 percent had high fibrosis 4 (FIB-4) scores, an index to measure liver scarring, meaning &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/many-dementia-cases-could-actually-be-a-hidden-form-of-liver-disease"&gt;they were very likely to have cirrhosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132698" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132698" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD.jpg" alt="diagram showing the different stages of liver damage" class="wp-image-132698 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD-642x514.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD-518x415.jpg 518w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/StagesOfLiverDamageDiagramMASLD-600x480.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132698" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cirrhosis is the result of persistent liver damage, where healthy tissue has been gradually replaced with scar tissue. (&lt;a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/study-shows-how-liver-damage-stress-and-aging-might-be-reversible"&gt;Kuo Du &lt;em&gt;et al., Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Virginia Commonwealth University biostatistician Scott Silvey, Bajaj, and colleagues repeated this review with 68,807 medical records of patients from a national database who aren't veterans, to see if their earlier results reflected the general US population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To their surprise, even more patients with high FIB-4 scores were found in this population – almost 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The prevalences and determinants of a high FIB-4 are striking, including a greater proportion of patients who were not white in the high FIB-4 group," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2024.06.014"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; Silvey and team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While we did not study the specific factors behind these disparities, a lack of access to therapy or medical care in both dementia care and comorbidity care could contribute."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once our livers start to malfunction, it &lt;a href="https://corporate.dukehealth.org/news/study-shows-how-liver-damage-stress-and-aging-might-be-reversible"&gt;stresses other tissues&lt;/a&gt; in our bodies, including kidneys, pancreas, and heart, as well as our brains. So it makes sense to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-adjustment-to-just-one-meal-can-benefit-liver-disease-patients"&gt;prioritize our liver health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This important link between dementia and liver health emphasizes the importance of screening patients for potentially treatable contributors to cognitive decline," &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/news/13-percent-of-patients-with-dementia-may-instead-have-cognitive-decline-from-cirrhosis"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Bajaj.&lt;/p&gt;

It also reduced inflammation in the body. These are all things that help to reduce your risk of heart rate abnormalities.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits were most significant in women, individuals without obesity, people ages under 60 years, and those with pre-existing long-term conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to add brisk walking to your daily routine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/brisk-walking" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brisk walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Brisk walking&lt;/a&gt; is a low cost, moderate-intensity aerobic activity with a low risk of injury.

Researchers tested this by having participants perform a 10-minute visual attention task while emotionally charged images appeared in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative images, such as a crying baby, disrupted task performance more than neutral or positive images and were remembered better afterward. These findings provide insight into how emotional distractions interfere with focus and could aid treatments for anxiety and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disruption by Emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Upsetting distractions cause slower, less accurate performance on attention tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Bias:&lt;/strong&gt; Negative distractors are more likely to be remembered than neutral or positive ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may help identify attention vulnerabilities in anxiety and PTSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Boston University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The world is full of distractions, like intrusive memories, worries about the future and reminders of things to do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sustained attention, the ability to maintain focus on a specific stimulus or task for an extended period without significant lapses in concentration, is a foundational cognitive process that underlies many other cognitive functions, impacts daily functioning and is commonly impaired across a diverse population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108875"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows the outline of a person." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/negative-distraction-attention-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers found that when the backgrounds were upsetting, participants were both slower and less accurate at the sustained attention task. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While upsetting thoughts and experiences can disrupt one’s ability to focus attention while performing everyday tasks, translating this phenomenon to the laboratory has remained elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from Boston University Chobanian &amp;amp; Avedisian School of Medicine and VA Boston Healthcare System have shown that when people are sustaining attention, distractions that are upsetting or unpleasant are most likely to disrupt that focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope these findings will assist in treating anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that negative distractions disrupted ongoing task performance as well as impacted  the participants’ mood by making them feel worse,” explained corresponding author Michael Esterman, PhD, principal investigator in the VA’s National Center for PTSD and BU associate professor of psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two groups of approximately 60 participants performed a series of tasks (called the gradCPT) requiring them to sustain their visual attention for about 10 minutes without a break, while photos of distractions would sometimes fade in and out in the background on a video monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These visual distractions could be upsetting (a crying baby), neutral (a chair), or positive (a smiling baby).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when the backgrounds were upsetting, participants were both slower and less accurate at the sustained attention task. After the task was completed, participants were tested for their memory of the background distractor, even though they were told to ignore these distractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found the upsetting distractors were remembered better than those that were neutral or positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this study will help scientists measure how distractible a person is, what is most distracting to them, and whether those distractions intrude in their memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also believe it can open new opportunities to study attention in clinical populations and their neural mechanism alongside brain imaging, both of which are directions we are currently pursuing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings appear online in the journal &lt;em&gt;Behavior Research Methods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding for this study was provided by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs through a Merit Review Award from the VA Clinical Sciences Research and Development Service (1I01CX002711-01) to J.D and M.E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and attention research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84e3edeae5e0c4e6f1aae1e0f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gina DiGravio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boston University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gina DiGravio – Boston University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-025-02641-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Characterizing the effects of emotional distraction on sustained attention and subsequent memory: A novel emotional gradual onset continuous performance task&lt;/a&gt;” by Michael Esterman et al. &lt;em&gt;Behavioral Research Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characterizing the effects of emotional distraction on sustained attention and subsequent memory: A novel emotional gradual onset continuous performance task&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examines the impact of emotional distraction on sustained attention using a novel gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT). Sustained attention is a foundational cognitive process, vulnerable to both internal (endogenous) and external (exogenous) disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliable, validated paradigms to assess internal sources of variation in sustained attention have been used to characterize basic aspects of attention as well as individual differences and neurobiological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, sustained attention can also be disrupted by external distraction, especially highly salient distractors, due to their affective and/or arousing nature. Markedly less work has been conducted to develop reliable and validated paradigms to study these effects on sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a novel task, the emogradCPT, to characterize the impact of emotional distractors (background images) on the ability to sustain attention during an emotionally neutral task (digit discrimination task).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across two experiments and three rounds of data collection, we demonstrate that emotionally negative distractors robustly and reliably disrupt ongoing ability to sustain attention, reflected in reduced accuracy, and slower RTs, relative to neutral, positive, and no distractor conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, we validated the task by correlating objective and subjective measures of distraction, as well as demonstrating the impact of these distractors on downstream memory encoding and affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making these data and tools publicly available, we encourage the use of this paradigm to inform future basic, clinical, and neuroimaging studies of affective interactions with ongoing goal-directed attentional processes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:48:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE54R0tIa3lFMFdEOWFZVU53eFQ0M0pmTUF3WWJpSTBEZVkwS0paNW02QVRiU0loamxyWkY0eHRTQUVIb09HUFZZb1lvdExNcDBsTXdBVmhrRHFxQnBFS0t4UFFyOUpYOUhlZFlGbE1wY0lGMjY0cVBBV1duRVZuQQ</guid></item><item><title>肉类蛋白质促进生存，但植物促进长寿- Earth.com | Meat protein boosts survival, but plants boost longevity - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOUTV0ZnByckg5MDVydjZwNVdnSTJjMUozYjI0WXhESzNqYktSRXdwXzlVY1AtN3FWcWtESHZGWWhVQm1Yb0tXZHY1dld3WjZmZlFwS2FMTFkxUnlWZTQxbkxhUzVQUVpTRVltYnpPQW16ZFNyLUxRNlhUdGl5TXRzc3BfWG5EMnVfOF9Z?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research points to protein-rich food choices as powerful drivers of health. Many people are now asking whether a meat-heavy approach to protein is truly the best strategy when it comes to living longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent findings show that countries with higher levels of animal-based protein see lower mortality rates among children under five, yet plant-based protein is linked with longer lifespans for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted out by PhD candidate Caitlin Andrews and her team, led by Dr. Alistair Senior at the &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-plants-to-meat-protein"&gt;From plants to meat &lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populations worldwide seem to be trading vegetables for meat. Researchers have observed that animal-based protein consumption has climbed across various regions over the past several decades. More societies are gravitating toward protein-dense foods derived from cattle, poultry, and pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts are not uniform, though. In several corners of the globe, chickpeas, beans, and other legumes are still mainstays, along with certain dairy and egg products. In resource-constrained nations, individuals often rely on whatever is the most affordable form of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-meat-protein-lowers-child-death-rates"&gt;Meat protein lowers child death rates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/child-mortality-under-5-years" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;under-fives&lt;/a&gt;, a food system that supplies large amounts of animal-based proteins and fats lowered rates of infant mortality,” said Andrews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In places where young children miss out on ample nutrition, extra amounts of animal-based protein can be tied to better early survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation involves the nutrients found in eggs, dairy, and meat. These foods contain essential amino acids, iron, zinc, and vitamins that help children grow. They also provide energy-dense fat, which supports early development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families who live in impoverished settings, however, often struggle to access such staples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-plant-protein-helps-adults-live-longer"&gt;Plant protein helps adults live longer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For adults, plant-based proteins increased overall life expectancy,” said Andrews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher plant-based protein intake appears to bring key advantages. Diets built around legumes, peas, lentils, and nuts are linked with fewer chronic conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who rely on beans, lentils, or tofu may also get more dietary fiber. That &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/fiber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; supports normal digestion and can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, too much red or processed meat is often linked with harmful effects that might shorten lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-good-fats-early-less-later"&gt;Good fats early, less later&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting aspect involves fat. Research suggests that in infancy and early childhood, certain animal fats might help reduce malnutrition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in life, though, cutting back on high-fat products can aid weight management, possibly easing issues like &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4314-hypertension-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods loaded with saturated fat may disrupt the balance if combined with processed sugars and a sedentary lifestyle. Such combinations might trigger an inflammatory state and higher vulnerability to illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern emphasizes how dietary composition can be more important than any single &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/animals-are-suffering-from-declining-plant-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrient&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-higher-cost-for-the-planet"&gt;A higher cost for the planet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Protein is a crucial part of the human diet, but as eating habits change and developed countries look to decarbonize, where we get our protein from has come under greater scrutiny,” noted the research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meat production draws attention for environmental reasons. Livestock farming typically requires more land and water compared to growing legumes or grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those aiming to reduce &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; often look to pea or chickpea farming as lower-impact methods. This is sparking interest in alternative proteins, such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-based-foods-promote-weight-loss-regardless-of-processing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these shifts need to be carefully approached, given how vital animal-sourced protein appears to be for child development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shifting-protein-needs"&gt;Shifting protein needs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What each person puts on the plate can differ by budget and culture. For families with small children, variety may be the safest bet. Adults seeking to improve their longevity might gain from swapping out meat for beans, peas, or other plant-based sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some individuals find plant protein more economical, while others view meat as a valued tradition. Experts advise that local resources and medical concerns shape the ideal balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best approach might be a mixed plan, adjusting as people move from childhood into later stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rethinking-protein-for-global-well-being"&gt;Rethinking protein for global well-being &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight a pattern: keep an eye on total protein intake first, then prioritize more plant-based sources past childhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future innovations may focus on improving vegetarian options for children at risk of malnutrition. Researchers also stress the need for more accessible programs, especially in areas with low food security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting the global menu can pose challenges. It involves policy support, agricultural reforms, and nutrition education. The end goal is to see infants thrive and older people enjoy extra years, while also safeguarding natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58475-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:26:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOUTV0ZnByckg5MDVydjZwNVdnSTJjMUozYjI0WXhESzNqYktSRXdwXzlVY1AtN3FWcWtESHZGWWhVQm1Yb0tXZHY1dld3WjZmZlFwS2FMTFkxUnlWZTQxbkxhUzVQUVpTRVltYnpPQW16ZFNyLUxRNlhUdGl5TXRzc3BfWG5EMnVfOF9Z</guid></item><item><title>意图如何塑造行动感知-神经科学新闻 | How Intent Shapes Perception of Action - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTFBONjZZcy1ET1AtUDBIOVp4dXg1dXBzd05yUHF4ZHlLbVlreFRWUXhBamNmSlYxSzg1MXA3SU1tQW9xQXpsY0daUkU1eGFRV0hubnZJWkdYc0hhYmlqSkVsNkJxcE5qQjVLY1dkTEctYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A groundbreaking study used a brain-machine interface to explore how intentions, actions, and their outcomes are temporally linked in the human brain. By recording single-neuron activity from a paralyzed individual with implanted electrodes, researchers enabled intentional hand movement through machine-learning-driven muscle stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that when actions are intentional, people perceive them as occurring faster, a phenomenon known as compressed temporal binding. This discovery sheds light on the neural encoding of intention and contributes to the ongoing debate over free will by showing that subjective intention aligns with motor cortex activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal Binding:&lt;/strong&gt; Intentional actions are perceived to occur sooner than involuntary ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Encoding of Intent:&lt;/strong&gt; Single neurons in the motor cortex reflect the experience of intention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Machine Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; The study leveraged implanted electrodes and machine learning to decode and act on motor intentions in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;PLOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers led by Jean-Paul Noel at the University of Minnesota, United States, have decoupled intentions, actions and their effects by manipulating the brain-machine interface that allows a person with otherwise paralyzed arms and legs to squeeze a ball when they want to. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the open-access journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt; on April 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, the study reveals temporal binding between intentions and actions, which makes actions seem to happen faster when they are intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separating intentions from actions was made possible because of a brain-machine interface. The participant was paralyzed with damage to their C4/C5 vertebrae and had 96 electrodes implanted in the hand region of their motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they tried to squeeze a ball, a machine-learning algorithm looked at all the signals coming to the electrodes, and learned which activity pattern meant “squeeze” (close) and which meant “relax” (open).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once learned, the machine could send an electrical signal to the appropriate hand muscles, allowing the participant to squeeze the ball, which then delivered a sound. On average, the participant perceived the time from intention to action to be 71 ms, which was slightly faster than the real time duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart of the study involved systematically removing each part of the chain of events. By randomly stimulating the participant’s hand to squeeze the ball, the researchers were able to eliminate intentions. In this case, actions were judged to occur much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when the participant tried to squeeze the ball, but actions were prevented by not stimulating the hand, intentions were perceived to happen much earlier if the sound was still played after the machine decoded the intention. Perceived timing did not change if the sound was not played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results indicated a compressed temporal binding between intention and action. Recordings from the electrodes, which normally cannot be done in humans, showed that the motor cortex encodes these intensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “The work builds on a long tradition trying to establish the temporal relationship between moving, the onset of the subjective experience of intending the movement, and the neural correlates of this intention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there have been quite a number of non-invasive studies on this topic, only a single study prior to our was able to measure single neurons – the gold-standard in neuroscience – in humans while asking them to report when they first ‘felt the urge to move’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors continue, “This prior work (Fried et al., 2011) showed that certain brain areas (all in the frontal cortex) know about the intention to move up to a second prior to when we experience that intention. You can imagine this created quite the debate regarding whether humans have free will or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study contributes to this debate by recording single neurons in the primary motor cortex. We show that firing of neurons in this area (the last cortical node before the spinal cord, which ultimately elicits movements) co-occur with the subjective experience of intending a movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude, “The work would have not been possible without expertise from a number of contributors, including neurosurgeons, neuroengineers and neuroscientists, among others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;AS is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (grant PP00P3 163951/1; www.snf.ch), OB is supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (www.snf.ch) and the Bertarelli Foundation (https://www.fondation-bertarelli.org/).

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study was funded by Cancer Playbook, which works with the Whole House Oncology Institute to collect, analyze and share &lt;a href="https://wholehealthoncology.com/featured" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;data on patient-reported outcomes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While research restrictions on Schedule I substances severely hamper clinical research on cannabis in humans, there is a large body of observational studies on medical cannabis and cancer – as well as lab research – that looks at cannabis’s effect on tumors in test tubes and in animals. The analysis included as many of those studies as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In order to move beyond bias – conscious or not – it was essential to use a large-scale, radically inclusive methodology based on mathematical reasoning,” Castle said, adding: “We wanted to analyze not just a handful, but nearly every major medical cannabis study to find the actual points of scientific agreement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Castle’s study looked at more than 10,000 studies on cannabis and cancer, which he said is “10 times the sample size of the next largest study, which we believe helps make it a more conclusive review of the scientific consensus”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To analyze the massive quantity of studies, Castle and his team used AI – specifically, the natural language processing technique known as “sentiment analysis”. This technique allowed the researchers to see how many studies had positive, neutral or negative views on cannabis’s ability to treat cancer and its symptoms by, for example, increasing appetite, decreasing inflammation or accelerating “apoptosis”, or the death of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Castle says his team hoped to find “a moderate consensus” about cannabis’s potential as a cancer treatment, and expected the “best case scenario” to be something like 55% of studies showing that medical cannabis improved cancer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It wasn’t 55-45, it was 75-25,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study overwhelmingly supported cannabis as a treatment for cancer-related inflammation, appetite loss and nausea. Perhaps more surprisingly, it also showed that cannabis has the potential to fight cancer cells themselves, by killing them and stopping their spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That’s a shocking degree of consensus in public health research, and certainly more than we were anticipating for a topic as controversial as medical cannabis,” Castle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Medical cannabis is controversial when it comes to cancer. A 2024 meta-analysis published last year in Jama&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that adults with cannabis-use disorder – defined by criteria including an inability to stop or cut down – &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2822269" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;were 3.5-5 times more likely to develop head and neck cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Donald Abrams, an oncologist and professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, says that study was “flawed” in his opinion, “as those patients are so often using tobacco and alcohol, known risk factors for those cancers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For his part, Abrams has found cannabis to be useful for cancer patients managing symptoms like appetite loss, nausea, pain and anxiety. But he is skeptical of claims that cannabis can actually &lt;em&gt;fight&lt;/em&gt; cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I have been an oncologist in San Francisco for 42 years now where many if not most of my patients have had access to cannabis. If cannabis cures cancer, I have not been able to appreciate that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, Abrams admits that “there is elegant pre-clinical evidence from test tubes and animal models that cannabis can affect cancer cells or transplanted tumors” but “as yet those findings have not translated into clinical benefit in people”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Castle, however, believes that the combination of pre-clinical evidence and patient reported outcomes show that cannabis does have cancer-fighting potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33623076/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;small pilot trial&lt;/a&gt; in which 21 patients received either a placebo or a cannabis-based medication in addition to traditional chemotherapy found that those who received the cannabis-based medication survived for longer. Another study of&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30275207/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 119 cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; found that synthetic CBD helped reduce tumor size and tumor cell circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But to truly prove the efficacy of cannabis and find the best treatment formulation, there would need to be much larger clinical trials in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Castle hopes that his meta-analysis will encourage the US Drug Enforcement Administration to complete the long-stalled process of reclassifying cannabis so it is no longer federally illegal, which could help remove restrictions on clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are not arguing that the standards for adopting new cancer treatments should be lower. We are arguing that medical cannabis meets or exceeds those standards,” he said, “often to a greater extent than current pharmaceutical treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxNelJXSTZKNnRZeUp4QnFlTzlIZ19fMUQ4VEU3LUgtcnlGNkpfdmdnVlBzTnhvY0Q0MTZnVXBVNUFPYTJWRjdRa1R4UzVaWFYwY0hkb3F4bkp5NTBTWjJhNk8tV3JxOWVKRGZ0WFJhYU5nNTJlT29Wa0t2eThVU2pTNklfRQ</guid></item><item><title>Newton-Wellesley医院一个病房的护士中有6例良性脑肿瘤，引发工人的不安-《波士顿环球报》 | Six cases of benign brain tumors among nurses at one Newton-Wellesley Hospital unit spark uneasiness among workers - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNSy12dW9sT1M2bl95MGRVb2I4SG1oak83N3o1aFNoOEJnWW1ZNFlEWWVYYnJYUGtUWGhrYWNIQllVeXYycUFxN3dyYnNvaEdNZWRkQXRBRUlEeTlBOURVaHZ6ME1UdjE3aThHOTkySjN5c0MwQ1M1ZVhZM29ZcG05UHhkSnhKdnBIcnMwZWRR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On Friday , the state health department’s Division of Radiation Control Program planned to return to &lt;a href="https://www.nwh.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Newton-Wellesley &lt;/a&gt;to review information previously provided by the hospital and to perform some confirmatory measurements, the statement said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Exposure of moderate-to-high doses of ionizing radiation, such as from medical imaging devices, has been linked to a higher risk for benign brain tumors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Disease trackers said more scrutiny is needed by independent experts — individuals who are not affiliated with the hospital or the workers’ union there — to help resolve the issue in a manner all sides will trust. They caution that similar work-based situations have taken months to sort through, and even then, definitive answers are often elusive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Further complicating the issue; the federal agency that typically is called in to investigate such matters, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, &lt;/a&gt;or NIOSH, was &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/11042025/trump-dismantles-worker-safety-agency-as-temperatures-rise/" target="_blank"&gt;recently gutted&lt;/a&gt; when two-thirds of its staff received lay-off notices from the Trump administration, making a NIOSH investigation into the potential cause of the tumors unlikely in the near future. OSHA does not do the sort of disease-tracking investigation that would pinpoint a potential cause for brain tumors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Joe Markman, spokesman for the &lt;a href="https://www.massnurses.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Massachusetts Nurses Association&lt;/a&gt;, the union that represents about 1,500 nurses at the hospital, said its members have a lot of questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We recognize that nurses and many other people want immediate information about the situation,” he said in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This urgency comes from a place of concern for the health of nurses, their families, and patients – an urgency that we share," Markman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The union late last month sent health questionnaires to its members at the hospital, and asked them to share it with other workers there, as well as nurses who formerly worked there. Markman said they’ve received about 300 completed forms and the union’s team of occupational safety and health nurses is poring through responses. They’re also seeking follow-up medical records to get a clearer picture of the potential scope of the issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The union does not have a timetable for when its investigation might be completed, but Markman said, “We are glad the hospital is continuing to look into this situation.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Newton-Wellesley Hospital administrators said they tapped outside environmental experts to help with a wide-ranging investigation that scrutinized water and air quality, as well as radiation levels and cleaning chemicals that workers on the fifth floor may have been exposed to. And, they said, they are continuing to work with state and federal investigators. Newton-Wellesley is part of the Mass General Brigham health system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our rigorous investigation has not identified any environmental trigger at Newton-Wellesley Hospital that causes brain tumors,” the hospital said in a statement. “We remain confident that our environment is safe for staff, clinicians, and patients.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Six current and former staffers from the fifth floor maternity unit have reported to hospital administrators that they have been diagnosed with benign brain tumors in recent years, hospital officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among those workers is a nurse who worked there 23 years ago and was diagnosed in 2021. Details about the other brain tumor cases have not been released by the hospital, except that the benign tumors are of three different types, and that the individuals included some who worked there only part-time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At least six other workers from the fifth floor also reported other health problems, hospital officials said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;About one&lt;a href="https://braintumor.org/brain-tumors/about-brain-tumors/brain-tumor-facts/" target="_blank"&gt; million Americans &lt;/a&gt;are living with a brain tumor, according to the National Brain Tumor Society. Nearly three-quarters of such tumors are benign. The majority of people with brain tumors are women, the society notes, and the median age for a diagnosis is 61, which describes the typical gender and age of nurses in Newton-Wellesley’s maternal unit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Without additional information, no conclusion can be reached: if it is due to chance, or some potential work related exposure,” said &lt;a href="https://cceh.sph.brown.edu/people/tongzhang-zheng" target="_blank"&gt;Tongzhang Zheng&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiology professor in the Brown School of Public Health, who is not involved in the Newton-Wellesley investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He said that these types of cases are usually deemed to be unrelated, after a neutral third-party reviews all the potential physical and chemical cancer-causing substances that a distinct group of workers was exposed to over a specific period of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Although a few chemicals (such as benzene, vinyl chloride, formaldehyde and bisphenol A) have been linked to brain tumor risks, the association for most of them is still uncertain,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Thirty years ago,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/hhe/reports/pdfs/1996-0012-2652.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; an investigation by NIOSH &lt;/a&gt;at Brigham and Women’s Hospital concluded that “major ventilation system deficiencies” could have contributed to poor indoor air quality that was linked to nurses’ respiratory and related health problems. But the investigators noted that by the time they arrived, several years after other reports failed to settle on a single source for the ailments, the hospital had already started to fix the ventilation system, and that complicated the investigators’ findings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Identifying the scores of workers who may have cycled in and out of Newton-Wellesley’s fifth-floor maternity unit over a decade or longer, but who may also have worked at other facilities in the intervening time, would be challenging, said &lt;a href="https://x.com/michaelmina_lab/status/1911792370531582050" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Michael Mina&lt;/a&gt;, a former Harvard professor who consults and advises public health organizations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It could be a [physical or chemical] exposure that happened there years ago... and now that exposure is gone, and that’s why these things are often hard to pin down,” he said. “And was there an overlap when all of these nurses were all there?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While acknowledging how challenging such investigations are, Mina said hospital administrators erred in declaring the hospital risk-free while tests are still ongoing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I would want to take a more cautions approach, saying, ”We don’t know, but everything we have found today suggests there is not an ongoing risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists at the &lt;strong&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/strong&gt; has developed a new &lt;strong&gt;chewing gum&lt;/strong&gt; that could dramatically reduce the transmission of &lt;strong&gt;influenza&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;herpes simplex viruses&lt;/strong&gt;. This surprising innovation could provide a low-cost, accessible solution for managing two of the most common and persistent viral threats. The gum is made from &lt;strong&gt;Lablab purpureus&lt;/strong&gt;, commonly known as &lt;strong&gt;lablab beans&lt;/strong&gt;, and it contains a naturally occurring antiviral protein called &lt;strong&gt;FRIL&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Targeting Viral Load at the Source&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new research was led by &lt;strong&gt;Henry Daniell&lt;/strong&gt;, the W.D. Miller Professor in the Department of Basic &amp;amp; Translational Sciences at Penn’s School of Dental Medicine. The study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(24)00808-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;published in Molecular Therapy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, builds on the team’s earlier work on a similar antiviral gum aimed at &lt;strong&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/strong&gt;. That formula, which is now in clinical trials, was shown to reduce viral presence in saliva or nasal swabs of COVID-19 patients by over 95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using this model, the researchers created a gum targeting &lt;strong&gt;HSV-1&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;HSV-2&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;H1N1&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;H3N2&lt;/strong&gt;, all of which are &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/dog-kisses-dangerous-owners-needs-to-know/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76006" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;transmitted primarily through the mouth&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike vaccines that target the immune system, this gum works locally in the &lt;strong&gt;oral cavity&lt;/strong&gt;, a site that plays a central role in transmission for many respiratory and contact-based viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;They found that chewing a two-gram tablet containing &lt;strong&gt;40 milligrams of FRIL&lt;/strong&gt; was enough to reduce viral loads in samples by more than &lt;strong&gt;95 percent&lt;/strong&gt;—a performance consistent with the earlier COVID-19 results. Importantly, the gum was manufactured as a &lt;strong&gt;clinical-grade drug product&lt;/strong&gt;, complying with &lt;strong&gt;FDA&lt;/strong&gt; requirements for drug safety and formulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Lab to Real-World Application&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Daniell emphasized the significance of focusing on the &lt;strong&gt;mouth&lt;/strong&gt; as a primary pathway of transmission. “Low vaccination rates for influenza viruses and the lack of an HSV vaccine underscore the need for a new approach—one that targets reducing viral loads at the sites where transmission occurs,” the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The antiviral action of FRIL was consistent and durable throughout testing. Unlike chemical disinfectants or nasal sprays, the gum allows the protein to &lt;strong&gt;linger in the oral environment&lt;/strong&gt;, creating a barrier that traps virus particles directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Researchers involved in the project include scientists from both Penn Dental Medicine and Finnish institutions such as the &lt;strong&gt;Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke)&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;University of Finland&lt;/strong&gt;, indicating a growing international collaboration around food-based viral interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Expanding Efforts to Combat Bird Flu&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With their earlier success in neutralizing &lt;strong&gt;SARS-CoV-2&lt;/strong&gt; and now influenza and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/why-you-should-never-kiss-a-baby-a-life-and-death-situation/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="72552" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herpes viruses&lt;/a&gt;, Daniell and his colleagues are turning their attention to a much larger and fast-spreading threat: &lt;strong&gt;avian flu&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In just the past three months, &lt;strong&gt;over 54 million birds&lt;/strong&gt; across North America have been affected by the &lt;strong&gt;H5N1 virus&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/man-couldnt-pee-pulled-out-parasite/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="86499" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human infections&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in both the &lt;strong&gt;United States&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Canada&lt;/strong&gt;. The team is exploring the use of lablab bean powder in &lt;strong&gt;bird feed&lt;/strong&gt;, aiming to interrupt virus transmission in poultry and potentially prevent human spillover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"&gt;&lt;video controls src="https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mmc2.mp4"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Release of FRIL and total protein from bean gum using chewing simulator ART-5&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Supporting evidence for this application is promising. Previous studies by other researchers have already shown that bean powder containing FRIL can neutralize &lt;strong&gt;H5N1&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;H7N9&lt;/strong&gt;, two strains of influenza A that are responsible for bird flu outbreaks in birds and humans alike.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is a timely innovation to prevent their infection and transmission,” Daniell said, referring to both human and avian flu viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

Officials said the Montcalm cases are not related to any others across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Health officials said the highly contagious disease is best prevanted through vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine remains our best defense, and two doses of MMR offer 97% protection against measles," Bagdasarian said in a statement. "We urge all Michigan residents to check their vaccination records to ensure they are up to date with the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The disease is spread through direct person-to-person contact and through the air. People can contract measles by being in a room where an infected person has also been up to two hours after they left, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Anyone who believes they may have been exposed should call their health care provider before seeking treatment so health care workers can take steps to ensure other individuals are not infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;According to the CDC, measles can cause serious complications like pneumonia and encephalitis. Experts say the disease is potentially deadly, especially for very young children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As of April 10, there have been 712 confirmed cases of measles across the U.S., including seven outbreaks. Most of the cases are in Texas, which has seen 561 cases since late January, according to the state's department of health and human services. Two Texas children have died due to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The nationwide case count is the highest since 2019, when 1,274 individual cases were confirmed in 31 states, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;mreinhart@detroitnews.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Max_DetroitNews" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/Max_DetroitNews" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;@max_detroitnews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 11:11:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi3wFBVV95cUxPTTVNcDNVLTNmaDI1V21mOHBoRW9iczhIWHhucWFUTlI0V0lCM0U4VTkycWZfclpBQ05maUxIOWtkTDM4RUdwVUlKUXBJc1Q3Z1lzYXRWSzFTVXZkMmdMcGVraExYSHFLSVpITllTVWxEUjNhZXlybTRfUktSMzFXdVdCdnN6bVNCdzZKbGFNWFk2RWFQY2Vyc2lENTg5NG5XSVlBNnVldjlKYl9icDV3U0pHMG9ZYXRsalhjZ0ExVzFPTmVCdmlDcnRyMkxjSXpvOFJvLUc2bWY5bUxEWXFn</guid></item><item><title>疫苗接种率显示，一些南方地区“极易受到麻疹爆发的影响” --《芝加哥论坛报》 | Vaccination rates show some Southland districts ‘extremely vulnerable’ to measles outbreaks - Chicago Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQV25LaHQ0MDhKYnlFNGZabXBfTk1ENEt0TU5Zc2RJQ0FORGU5OUwybE8tamNDdTZJdzY2VV84Q1NlajR4dTgtbWJhQ0gycHBqLURNWlM0Y0g0VDNZZ1laZUU3Q3VGQkFKYVNHWkxPSFRURlVwVkY0YjBHUzdrY3gxWHAwd2RmbWs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/04/09/illinois-measles-vaccination-rates/"&gt;online tool&lt;/a&gt; launched by the Illinois Department of Public Health shows measles vaccination rates for schools in Homer Glen, Oak Lawn and Dolton are below 91%, making those schools “extremely vulnerable to larger outbreaks and disruptions from any cases introduced into that school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy and lack of access to medical care are among factors to blame for the south and southwest suburbs’ fewer immunizations compared to other regions, said Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim chief operating officer of the Cook County Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Southland is really big, right? And so there are all these factors that come into play in terms of, do we have the appropriate number of health care providers and clinics? Do we have the appropriate level of public transportation and opportunities to get from point A to point B? All these things play a role in terms of getting those critical preventative services that we all need,” Joshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 10% of schools across Illinois reporting vaccination rates below 91%, three are within Alsip Hazelgreen Oak Lawn District 126. However, Superintendent Craig Gwaltney reported incorrect numbers for the district’s early childhood center, which he said was 100% vaccinated, rather than 0% as seen on the state dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been here for 30 years — I know the historical data,” Gwaltney said Wednesday. “We never have a problem with vaccination coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of October, the district reported 85.4% of students at Lane Elementary and 74.5% of students at Stony Creek Elementary were vaccinated against the measles. Gwaltney said those numbers don’t reflect the immunization rates now, which he said are 96.2% at Stony Creek and 97.2% at Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The up-to-date percentages reflect an increase from last year, as Stony Creek reported 88.2% and Lane reported 86.9% of students immunized during the full 2023-2024 school year. Gwaltney dismissed those rates were “nothing that anybody else hasn’t seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re fine — it’s not anything alarming to me,” Gwaltney said. “I know our community, and we know what we need to do.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Neighboring District 125’s Lawn Manor School had only 81.5% of its students vaccinated this school year, according to the dashboard. Oakwood School in Lemont, Wilkins Elementary School in Justice and Sorrick Elementary School in Palos Hills also dropped below 91% at 90.1%, 86% and 90.3%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two schools within Worth District 127 are considered extremely vulnerable to measles, with Worth Elementary School at 87.2% and Worthwoods Elementary at 87.2%. Arbor Park District 145’s Kimberly Heights School in Tinley Park is 88.5% vaccinated, the dashboard shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farther east, Riverdale Elementary School reported 87.6% of students were vaccinated during the 2024-2025 school year and Washington Elementary reported  89.5%. Both are within Dolton West District 148.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dolton District 149, 86.9% of Berger-Vandenberg Elementary students, 85.9% of Caroline Sibley Elementary School students and 88.7% of Creative Communications Academy students are vaccinated, according to the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arcadia Elementary School showed 90.9% vaccinated and Richton Square School was at 87.9% vaccinated. Both are within Matteson Elementary District 162.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookwood District 167’s Hickory Bend School reported 88.9% vaccinated and Wagoner Elementary School in Community District 168 reported 89.9% vaccinated. Sandridge School in Lynwood’s District 172 showed 77.6% vaccinated and Steger Primary Center in District 194 was at 87.9% vaccinated, the dashboard showed. Thornton Township High School in District 205 is 88.2% vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The south suburbs see the lowest immunization rates compared to the rest of suburban Cook County, sitting at 96% during the 2023-2024 school year, according to the Cook County Department of Public Health. During the same period, southwest suburban schools were about 96.5% vaccinated, west suburban were 97% vaccinated and north suburban were close to 97.5% vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshi said he encourages parents to check the dashboard to see where their child’s school falls with vaccination coverage. Although schools below 91% are extremely vulnerable, the cutoff for community immunity is 95% vaccinated, and schools with rates below that are at an increased risk of an outbreak, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Looking at that dashboard will arm you with information that you could use to be an advocate for immunization,” Joshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Will County&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the state health department dashboard, fewer schools in Will County, compared to neighboring Cook County, report vaccination rates below 91%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They include Goodings Grove in Homer Elementary District 33C, at 90.7%, Talala Elementary in Crete-Monee District 201-U, at 88.5%, and Fairmont School in Fairmont District 89, at 87.8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health mandates and guidelines created pushback within District 33C following COVID-19 lockdowns. A group of area parents, organized via social media, &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/06/23/group-opposing-mask-mandates-sex-education-changes-protest-at-homer-glen-school-board-meeting/"&gt;protested&lt;/a&gt; mask mandates, and several candidates challenging board members in recent elections also &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2023/03/23/homer-district-33c-candidates-discuss-covid-restrictions-overcrowding-and-sex-education-guidelines/"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; masks and school closures.&lt;/p&gt;

(Alicia Fabbre/for the Daily Southtown)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Portwood, Homer 33C assistant superintendent for human resources,  said district officials have done their part to ensure parents either immunize their children or apply for a religious exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All we can do is make sure that parents are educated,” Portwood said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the district has full compliance with state guidelines, meaning parents who have chosen not to vaccinate their children have filed an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to file one of those forms, they have to speak with a doctor and be informed of the risks,” Portwood said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portwood declined to speculate on why Goodings Grove has a higher rate of exemption filings than other schools. He said the district recently saw a suspected case, but it turned out not to be measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vaccination and communication&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state public health department updated the online dashboard Tuesday with immunization rates from the current school up to October 2024. The move followed a rise in measles cases reported across 25 states, including Indiana and Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of April 10, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=There%20have%20been%207%20outbreaks,285)%20were%20outbreak%2Dassociated."&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 712 measles cases and three deaths, reflecting a sharp increase from 2024, which saw 285 cases. Illinois has not reported any cases of measles yet this year, and all those who have died from the highly contagious disease were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could prevent all of that if we could get everyone vaccinated,” Joshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herd immunity for the measles is reached when more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, according to the CDC. Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine is about 97% effective at preventing the disease, while one dose is 93% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshi said measles is one of the most contagious diseases, with one infected person spreading it to nine out of 10 people nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

(Cynthia Goldsmith/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via AP)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs and symptoms appear seven to 14 days after contact with the virus and include high fever, coughing, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash. Measles can cause serious health complications, particularly in children below age 5, the CDC states, including pneumonia and encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slow decline in vaccination across Cook County mirrors state and nationwide trends and is largely attributable to misinformation and disinformation that is able to spread quickly online, Joshi said. He said as a practicing doctor, he has seen firsthand how false information becomes embedded in certain patients and affects their health decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s incumbent on us as a health department to address those myths with facts,” Joshi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cook County Public Health Department is working to do exactly that with their Myth Vs. Facts campaign, which aims to address common misconceptions about COVID-19, flu and RSV in a really clear and accessible way, Joshi said. The effort, largely seen via the health department’s social media accounts, launched during the most recent flu season and plans to expand to measles vaccination soon.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants in the tart cherry drink group also reported a 9 percent improvement in their quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“This trial indicates that twice-daily tart cherry supplementation can improve irritable bowel disorder-related quality of life as well as the severity of symptoms and therefore may be important in the management of ulcerative colitis,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-an-inflamed-gut-affect-your-health" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;How does an inflamed gut affect your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Gut inflammation causes more than just intestinal discomfort, says &lt;a href="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://umg.rwjms.rutgers.edu/doctor_page.php?phys_id=125744" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ellen Stein," data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ellen Stein,&lt;/a&gt; MD, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In fact, it can cause lots of issues with your overall health, including joint pain, feeling tired or fatigued, dysbiosis [an imbalance of gut bacteria], or malabsorption, she says. It can also lead to worse symptoms of lactose intolerance or fructan sensitivity, Dr. Stein says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“Treating the underlying cause of the disease is important— avoiding gluten for Celiac disease patients, calming inflammation with medication for irritable bowel disease  patients, and eating a healthy diet and avoiding unnecessary antibiotics for those with gut [imbalance],” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Ultimately, it’s really important to take care of your gut, says &lt;a href="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://drashkanfarhadi.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ashkan Farhadi" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ashkan Farhadi&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a gastroenterologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. “When the gut is inflamed, there’s a lot of inflammation throughout the body,” he says. “It causes a lot of trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-tart-cherry-juice-help-reduce-inflammation" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;How does tart cherry juice help reduce inflammation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;It’s important to point out that this study was only done on a small group of people, and it was also funded by the Cherry Marketing Institute, a non-profit group that represents American cherries. (However, the organization didn’t influence the design of the study or the results.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;That said, there are a few theories on why this drink may help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Tart cherries have polyphenols, which are naturally occurring plant compounds that act as antioxidants, and which may help tamp down on inflammation, Dr. Stein says. “Some other theories suggest that there is a prebiotic effect of this substance,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“We can also just take these findings at face value, because there is a lot of information to show that the juice reduces inflammation in the group that took it compared to the placebo,” Dr. Farhadi says. “But we really have to take this with a grain of salt because there were only a few participants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Stein stresses that, at this point, more data is needed to prove this connection, since most studies on tart cherry juice are small and results have been mixed. “There is nothing truly convincing that this particular food is the key to all health,” she says. “That said, it probably tastes good and in moderation is a healthy food to consume.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-would-i-have-to-drink-to-see-the-positive-effects" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="24.0"&gt;How much would I have to drink to see the positive effects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Not much. This particular study had people drink 130 milliliters of a tart cherry drink twice a day, which is a little less than 4.5 ounces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-else-can-i-do-to-reduce-gut-inflammation" data-node-id="26" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="26.0"&gt;What else can I do to reduce gut inflammation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While research into the potential impact of tart cherry juice on the gut is ongoing, doctors say there are a few things you can do to lower levels of inflammation in your gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Stein suggests having a regular exercise routine, eating a healthy diet with fiber from natural sources, getting plenty of good quality sleep, trying to reduce chronic stress, and focusing on your overall health. “Eating a balanced diet with healthy foods and less processed foods also seems to help, like the Mediterranean diet,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PLANO, Texas — A person who tested positive for &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-outbreak-texas-updates-numbers-cases-dfw-dallas-everything-need-know/287-b3720460-9d97-4d3c-b646-f056c40a3807" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; visited three stores, including a Walmart, in Plano while still infectious, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collin County Health Care Services issued a news release Thursday night saying "an individual who spent time in Collin County" on April 10 and 11 has tested positive for measles. The person visited the three stores while still infectious, officials said:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walmart: 6001 N. Central Expressway, Plano (April 10, time unknown)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ross Dress For Less: 3300 N. Central Expressway, Plano (April 11, 5-10 p.m.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dollar Tree: 2404 K Ave., Plano (April 11, evening)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials warned that if you were at those locations on those dates and times, and you're not vaccinated against measles, then you might be at risk of contracting the virus. Measles can be transmitted person-to-person through the air or contaminated surfaces, officials said, and the virus can remain airborne for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what health officials said you should do:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. If you were at one of the venues on the dates and times listed above and are: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Unvaccinated and pregnant; or &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Immunocompromised (receiving treatment that would result in immune system suppression, or have an immune system disease), It is recommended that you contact your health-care provider immediately to discuss the possible exposure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Anyone who was at the venues on the dates listed above should monitor themselves for measles symptoms through April 20, 2025. Those symptoms include: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis) &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Koplik’s spots: Small white spots with bluish-white centers found inside the mouth &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• A skin rash made up of large, flat blotches&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. If you develop symptoms of measles: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Stay home and away from others. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Contact your healthcare provider for guidance. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Call before visiting a clinic or hospital to prevent possible exposure to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/meales-case-reported-rockwall-county-connected-west-texas-outbreak/287-755a7364-e01d-444a-9ffe-f4d80dad4918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;latest reported instance&lt;/a&gt; of measles in North Texas. It's unclear if the measles case reported by Collin County is tied to the main outbreak of measles in West Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rockwall County Health Authority on Wednesday issued a public health notification informing residents that an adult tested positive for measles last week, the agency said in a press release. The individual recently traveled to West Texas and was at home for most of their infectious period, the county said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The researchers grew 28 different strains of paddy rice at four different locations in China in experimental conditions over a 10-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They found that arsenic levels in the rice increased as carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere and temperatures rise. Then epidemiologists modelled how, at current rice consumption levels, these arsenic levels could affect people's health. They estimated that the corresponding increases in arsenic levels in rice could contribute approximately 19.3 million more cancer cases in China alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51bt5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Arsenic in rice could increase as CO2 levels and temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Arsenic in rice could increase as CO2 levels and temperatures continue to rise (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Inorganic arsenic has been shown in more studies than I can throw a stick at to be a carcinogen, to have adverse effects with respect to pulmonary health, with respect to cardiovascular health – it's a long laundry list," says Lewis Ziska, associate professor of environmental health science at Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the study. "And two metrics of climate change – the increase in CO2 and the increase in temperatures – are resulting in greater amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's worth noting that the researchers' worst-case scenario is beyond the high emissions "business as usual" scenario used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body on climate change. The most dire predictions assume temperatures rise by 2C, and CO2 levels increase by an additional 200 parts per million between 2025 and 2050. But it does provide a snapshot of what may happen to rice crops in the future if carbon emissions are not reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're not the first ones to look at CO2, we're not the first ones to do temperature – but we're the first ones to put them together in the field. And that's what stunned us," says Ziska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Of course, the study has limitations, aside from the metrics chosen for the 2050 scenario. For one, it assumed that people will continue to consume the same amount of rice per person in 2050 that they were eating in 2021, even though, as countries get wealthier, their rice consumption tends to drop. On the other hand, it also assumed that people would continue to eat far more white rice than brown rice, like they do now. Because of how it is processed, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.70008" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;white rice contains less inorganic arsenic than brown rice&lt;/a&gt; – so a shift in the other direction could make numbers even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Still, this is "one of the most comprehensive studies" ever done on the topic, says Andrew Meharg, professor at the school of biological sciences at Queen's University Belfast, and a long-time researcher of rice and arsenic, who was not involved in the study.

They recommend first parboiling the rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining. Then add fresh water and cook it on a lower heat to absorb all the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Rice tends to be choked out by weeds. But rice can grow in water, while weeds cannot. "That gives rice a big advantage over weeds, and you don't have to spray, you don't have to hoe," Ziska says. "But there's a downside. The downside is, because it's flooded, there's no oxygen in the soil." In these conditions, anaerobic bacteria in the soil then turn to arsenic as an alternative to oxygen to accept electrons as they respire. These bacteria then facilitate &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/trends/plant-science/fulltext/S1360-1385(04)00173-6" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;reactions with other minerals in the soil&lt;/a&gt; that make the arsenic more bioavailable and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2004.01035.x" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;easier for the rice plants to absorb&lt;/a&gt; through their root systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"When you shift the soil by making it less having less oxygen, arsenic comes into its own," Ziska says. It &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.7b02970" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;changes the microbiome of the soil&lt;/a&gt; in such a way that arsenic-loving bacteria become more prolific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;And this is what he and his fellow researchers predict will get worse as temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rise. "This bacteria in the soil is getting more carbon. It's getting warmer. And it's being more active," Ziska says. "It really is a synergistic effect. You're making the little bacteria happier with warm, warmer temperatures, but you're also giving them more carbon, and they just go crazy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ziska and his team found that this effect played out for about 90% of the 28 different types of rice that they grew over their 10-year study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c43.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Parboiling rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining can help reduce arsenic levels (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Parboiling rice in pre-boiled water for five minutes before draining can help reduce arsenic levels (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;What worries public health experts is that the more research is done on inorganic arsenic, the worse its effect on humans appears to be. In January 2025, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/document/&amp;amp;deid=363892" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the US's Environmental Protection Administration updated their assessment&lt;/a&gt; of inorganic arsenic's &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;"cancer potency factor"&lt;/a&gt;, taking into account all new research on arsenic and disease. Their latest assessment found that "arsenic is a lot more potent of a carcinogen than we previously believed", says Keeve Nachman, professor of environmental health and engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a co-author of the rice and arsenic study. In particular, there is now good evidence that arsenic not only raises the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://publications.iarc.fr/120" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;risk of skin cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lung and bladder cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For individuals, the risks are slight. For example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the latest EPA review&lt;/a&gt; found that consuming 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day – or 7.8 micrograms for a 60kg person – would raise the risk of developing bladder cancer by about 3% and diabetes by about 1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But across populations, particularly those that eat a lot of rice, these small risks can add up. And, if the predictions made by Ziska and his colleagues turn out to be correct, this could significantly impact disease in populations that depend on rice as a staple over the decades to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="callout-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fpVHcM"&gt;&lt;section class="sc-88ce25f0-0 hKyLjB"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-1 fWLEJY"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-88ce25f0-3 KoeIS"&gt;Inorganic arsenic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-2 fTeQYN"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-88ce25f0-4 jYFeys"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If everyone consumes 0.13 micrograms per kg of body weight of inorganic arsenic per day, for example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://iris.epa.gov/static/pdfs/0278tr.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the EPA calculates&lt;/a&gt; that – compared to consuming noinorganic arsenic – an additional eight people out of every 10,000 get bladder cancer, an additional 10 out of 10,000 get lung cancer, an additional 110 per 10,000 get ischemic heart disease, and an additional 129 out of 10,000 develop diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, aside from cutting emissions and keeping temperature rise as low as possible, what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0l51c70.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Rice is a staple food for billions of people worldwide (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There also needs to be better monitoring and regulation of arsenic exposures in food, researchers say.

In 2023, the EU set new limits on inorganic arsenic in rice at 0.2mg/kg of rice while China has proposed introducing similar limits. But these recommendations don't take into account the fact that some communities eat far more rice than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are ways in which to reduce the amount of inorganic arsenic, but it will require a fundamental change in management of how rice is currently being grown," Ziska says.

She traced her fingers over her swollen skin and sobbed, placing her face in her hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I hate that I do this to myself,” &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahredzikowski/video/7448382169505975583?_t=ZP-8uZiakZiPF9&amp;amp;_r=1" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;she said&lt;/a&gt; softly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Redzikowski, 40, was talking to her TikTok followers about a secret she had kept hidden from even her closest friends and family for decades: Since age 12, she has compulsively picked her skin, often to the point that it bleeds and scars. As desperately as she wants to quit, Ms. Redzikowski, who has a mental health condition called dermatillomania, simply cannot stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She estimates that she spends at least two hours per week scraping at the skin on her face — and her scalp, arms, back, chest and legs. “I’ve spent at least 125 days of my life bent over a mirror,” she said in the video. “And that’s 125 days I’ll never get back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;She wiped her eyes and squirted cleanser onto her palms, massaging it over her face until it started to foam. Then she began the familiar routine of trying to repair the damage she had done. She waved a high-frequency wand over the constellation of lesions on her cheeks, willing them to heal faster. She slathered her face in spot treatments and serums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, her skin was angry, bleeding in some places. And she was angry with herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“It’s an internal battle, because I do know it’s not my fault, and I’m not wanting to do this,” she said in an interview. “But it is my hand. I did do the damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;People with dermatillomania or other conditions like it, such as uncontrollable hair pulling or nail biting — which are known as body-focused repetitive behaviors, or BFRBs — can feel a sense of shame so debilitating, they will not admit to the behaviors even in anonymous surveys, medical experts said. After all, it’s their fingers plucking strands of hair, their nails digging into their skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When hit with a headache or fever, people often &lt;a href="https://www.japha.org/article/S1544-3191(22)00079-6/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;reach for over-the-counter painkillers&lt;/a&gt; like acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as their first line of defense.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Used correctly, these drugs can be safe and effective for pain relief. That means following the instructions on the label and the advice of a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But that's not how we take these medications in real life," says &lt;a href="https://www.trishapasricha.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Trisha Pasricha&lt;/a&gt;, a physician and instructor at Harvard Medical School. Some people take too much pain medication too quickly, misdiagnose an ailment and take the wrong drug, or unknowingly take multiple pain relievers at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pds.4391#:~:text=15%25%20of%20adult%20ibuprofen%20users,more%20than%201%20usage%20occasion" target="_blank"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2018, for example, found that 15% of over 1,300 survey participants exceeded daily NSAID dosages, and most participants didn't recognize that all the products they were taking were NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These behaviors can lead to serious side effects, from bloating and nausea all the way up to heart attack and stroke, Pasricha says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To prevent these risks, the health care professionals we spoke to for this story say it's important to get to know the painkillers in your medicine cabinet. Here are 10 things they wish you knew about these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Acetaminophen is usually the better choice for fevers&lt;/strong&gt;, says University of California San Francisco (UCSF) clinical pharmacist &lt;a href="https://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/candy-tsourounis" target="_blank"&gt;Candy Tsourounis&lt;/a&gt;. Commonly known as Tylenol, it's thought to reduce fever and relieve minor aches and pains by raising your body's pain threshold and regulating your body temperature. It's also gentler on the body than NSAIDs are.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. NSAIDs are generally considered more effective than acetaminophen for pain relief&lt;/strong&gt;, Tsourounis says, especially for inflammatory pain like muscle aches. While acetaminophen is thought to work only on the central nervous system, NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (like Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (like Aleve) work throughout the body to reduce inflammation, pain and fever.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Taking too much acetaminophen at one time or too many doses close together can cause liver damage&lt;/strong&gt;, Tsourounis says. So stick to 3,000 milligrams of the drug at most per day, and don't mix it with alcohol, which is also hard on the liver.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. NSAIDs carry risks to the gut and the heart.&lt;/strong&gt; Common side effects include stomach pain, heartburn and bloating. You can also experience more serious damage like ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding or kidney damage if you take NSAIDs at too high a dose or even just for too long a time period, Pasricha says. And non-aspirin NSAIDs have the potential to raise your blood pressure. Every NSAID has a different max dose, so pay attention to your labels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. If you're not sure which painkiller to use or how much to take, talk to a pharmacist&lt;/strong&gt;, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blamoh-twegbe/" target="_blank"&gt;Blamoh Twegbe&lt;/a&gt;, pharmacy manager at UCSF outpatient pharmacy. "Please utilize us. That's what we're here for!" They can help you make an informed decision by asking about your type of pain and chronic conditions and by checking any potential drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. There's a limit to how much pain NSAIDs can treat&lt;/strong&gt;, Pasricha says. If you take more than the recommended dosage or more than one type of NSAID at once — for example, combining Motrin and Aleve — you're increasing your risk of side effects without getting any additional pain relief. If you feel your over-the-counter (OTC) drugs aren't working, talk to a doctor or pharmacist instead of ignoring the warning label.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-58991" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                If you're regularly taking the same over-the-counter pain medications, talk to your doctor about alternatives that can better address your symptoms.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. If you're habitually reaching for the same OTC pain medication, talk to your health care provider.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, if you're taking naproxen every day of your period every month because of muscle cramps. Pasricha says that pain might signal a larger underlying health&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;problem that could be better treated with prescription medication, lifestyle changes or both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Beware of accidentally overmedicating with a combination OTC drugs. &lt;/strong&gt;Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are often included in a lot of other sick-day remedies, like migraine medication, allergy pills or all-in-one cold and flu medicines, Twegbe says. So when you're not feeling well, double-check your labels before assuming you need a dose of Tylenol on top of those cold-relief meds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59002" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Alternating between acetaminophen and an NSAID like ibuprofen can be safe and effective for pain management.

                &lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;b class="hide-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;hide caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;


            &lt;b class="toggle-caption"&gt;&lt;b&gt;toggle caption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;span class="credit" aria-label="Image credit"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Alternate between NSAIDs and acetaminophen to manage major pain and reduce side effects. &lt;/strong&gt;If you're suffering from the flu or nursing a new injury and need strong and steady pain relief, switching between acetaminophen and an NSAID like ibuprofen every few hours can be a safe and effective way to help you cope until your symptoms subside, Twegbe says. Just make sure to follow recommended dosages and dosing times for each medication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Think beyond pills.&lt;/strong&gt;  Because over-the-counter pain relievers are so readily available, people often forget that pills aren't the only option when suffering from minor aches and pains, Pasricha says. Many NSAIDs and other analgesics are available in topical form, like creams or patches, and can offer similar relief without the potential side effects to your gut.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are also nonmedication remedies, like heating pads to ease back pain or exercising in water for arthritis. Talk to your doctor about your alternatives, Pasricha says. "They might even control your pain more reliably than just taking medicine."&lt;/p&gt;

But what if you were told that just 2 minutes of walking—yes, a chill, post-meal kind of walk—could actually help you fight off some serious health issues like diabetes and heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s fast-paced, work-from-home, always-in-a-rush lifestyle, we rarely move around after meals. We eat and then slump into the couch, scroll endlessly, or get back to our laptops. Over time, this sedentary behavior builds up and silently starts messing with our metabolism, blood sugar, and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s where the magic of mini walks comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sitting down after a full meal feels like a natural reflex. But here’s the not-so-fun truth: right after you eat, your blood sugar levels spike, especially if your meal was rich in carbs. This spike requires insulin to kick in and shuttle that sugar into your cells. Now, if you're just lounging around post-meal, your muscles aren’t helping out much. They’re inactive, which means your body takes longer to bring those blood sugar levels down. Over time, this constant spike-crash cycle can lead to insulin resistance. That’s a direct ticket to type 2 diabetes. Add to that the extra calories that don't get used and end up being stored as fat, often around your belly—aka the danger zone for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The power of a 2-minute walk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, studies are showing that just 2 minutes of light walking after eating can dramatically reduce your post-meal blood sugar levels. It sounds almost impossible that such a tiny amount of effort can have such a big impact, but science backs it up. One major &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-022-01649-4#Sec35" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Sports Medicine in 2022 analyzed several trials and concluded that people who took short walks (2 to 5 minutes) after meals had significantly lower blood sugar levels compared to those who just sat around. Even just standing helped a little, but walking was clearly better. When you walk, even casually, your leg and core muscles start contracting and your body starts using up the glucose floating around in your blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking right after meals helps avoid that post-lunch slump. You stay more alert, energetic, and less bloated. And all of this goodness happens in just two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes and heart disease often go hand in hand. When your blood sugar is out of control, it affects your blood vessels, your blood pressure, and your overall cardiovascular health. The more sugar floating around unnecessarily, the more damage to your arteries over time. Leisure walking improves circulation, lowers blood pressure, and reduces triglycerides (those nasty fats in your blood). It also reduces inflammation, which is a key culprit in both heart disease and insulin resistance. Even short walks, when done regularly, can help your heart stay young. You don’t need a treadmill or running shoes. Just your feet and a little commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make this a habit&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few easy ways to sneak in your 2-minute stroll:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post-breakfast walk around the house: Instead of heading straight to work mode, pace around your living room while planning your day or replying to texts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After lunch office loop: Walk a lap around your office floor or even just head to the farthest restroom and back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dinner wind-down walk: Take your family or your dog out for a short stroll after dinner. It’s good for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Staircase strolls: Just walk up and down a few stairs at a casual pace. You’ll get your steps in and help digestion too&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make it casual. Make it enjoyable. Maybe even call someone during that walk or listen to a short podcast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with 2 minutes within 60 to 90 minutes after a meal, ideally sooner. The earlier you move after eating, the more effective it is in flattening that blood sugar spike. Of course, if you have more time and energy, walking for 10-15 minutes gives even better results. But remember: 2 minutes is still infinitely better than zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world obsessed with high-intensity workouts and 30-day challenges, we often underestimate the power of small, consistent habits. And walking for just 2 minutes after a meal might be one of the most underrated health hacks out there. It doesn’t feel like much. It might even feel silly at first. But over time, it adds up to lower blood sugar, better heart health, more energy, and possibly even weight loss. So here’s your reminder: the next time you eat, don’t just sit there. Walk a little. Let your body do its thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;20 mins of extra walking every day slashes cardiovascular disease risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
