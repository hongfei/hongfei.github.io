Besides playing a key role in sexual and reproductive health, it strengthens bones, keeps skin supple, regulates sugar levels, increases blood flow, lowers inflammation and supports the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“You name the organ, and it promotes the health of that organ,” said Roberta Brinton, a neuroscientist who leads the Center for Innovation in Brain Science at the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But appreciation for estrogen’s more expansive role has been slow in coming. The compound was first identified in 1923 and was henceforth known as the “female sex hormone” — a one-dimensional reputation baked into its very name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Estrogen” comes from the Greek “oestrus,” a literal gadfly known for whipping cattle into a mad frenzy. Scientifically, estrus has come to mean the period in the reproductive cycles of some mammals when females are fertile and sexually active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Women don’t enter estrus; they menstruate. Nevertheless, when researchers named estrogen, these were the roles it was cast in: inducing a frenzy and supporting female sexual health. Now, estrogen is gaining recognition for what may be its most important role yet: influencing the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Neuroscientists have learned that estrogen is vital to healthy brain development but that it also contributes to conditions including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s. Changes in estrogen levels — either from the menstrual cycle or external sources — can exacerbate migraines, seizures and other common neurological symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Since then, there’s no looking back. They are versatile tiny seeds with a powerful nutrient profile. So much so that they have the power to transform your health even if you eat soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a gastroenterologist, recently shared on social media that consuming a tablespoon of chia seeds daily can be the best thing to do for your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a reel uploaded on his personal handle, Dr. Sethi explains how chia seeds can help reset gut health, prompting an investigation into the effects of a two-week chia seed regimen on metabolism. Here are several benefits of incorporating soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Provides fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tiny, nutrient-rich seeds can improve digestion due to their high fiber content, helping regulate bowel movements for those struggling with constipation, though adequate water intake is necessary to prevent bloating. High fibre in food helps in better movement of stools and prevent constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that consuming chia seeds can significantly improve gut health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keeps you energetic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soaked chia seeds provide sustained energy throughout the day through their combination of protein, healthy fats, and carbohydrates. Therefore, they can prevent the energy slump during the day and keep you away from fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hydrate you better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summertime may wreak havoc on your hydration levels. Too much sweating and harsh summer sun may cause water loss and severe dehydration. Chia seeds' ability to absorb water and form a gel-like substance aids in maintaining longer hydration, particularly beneficial for those who exercise or live in hot climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Helps with weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to lose weight without much effort? Start taking soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks in your diet. Their expanding property in the stomach promotes feeling full for extended periods, potentially aiding in weight management, though overconsumption could lead to excess calorie intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rich in omega&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The omega-3 fatty acids in chia seeds contribute to heart health, potentially reducing bad cholesterol and heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Heals inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is the invitation to many diseases like liver problems and even cancer. The antioxidants present in chia seeds offer benefits for skin protection against inflammation. Consuming soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks may also prevent aging and promote strong, healthy hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating soaked chia seeds for 2 weeks can lead to many health benefits. However, it's important to eat them in moderation and drink plenty of water. Try adding them to smoothies, yogurt, or salads for a simple and healthy boost or you may also soak them in water overnight, add a few drops of lemon in the morning and drink as a quick fat burner protein rich drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 04:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在太空实验室爆炸中尝试大胆种植食物-英国广播公司 | Trial to boldly grow food in space labs blasts off - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5wZGZSUXpNMFplOFNFd1ROSlJBMUpobUN3Q3ZKMV9LLUJZa1k3NWZnYVNCd0JmbnFmM3VuOEpyZmlpc3FwV1B2cVdfZ0NJekdlZFlVb2o5cVNCQdIBX0FVX3lxTFA4OVh6RkFGMDFxQ1Z5VDRURVl4d0ZNSUtiNVpycXF5NU54M2FUV2VHMTBSY2VfRWl1TXJoUzlPWU1Odnk1c2FPQ0pwZWF4b0x1THI0aVZSVGpYUmstaS1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-737179d2-0 dAzQyd"&gt;Mission to boldly grow food in space labs blasts off&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250409-091508-0ef9b7676-web-2.19.1-12/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4574/live/90811480-0eea-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4574/live/90811480-0eea-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4574/live/90811480-0eea-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4574/live/90811480-0eea-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4574/live/90811480-0eea-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4574/live/90811480-0eea-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4574/live/90811480-0eea-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4574/live/90811480-0eea-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Frontier Space Realistic artist impression of a box about to be ejected into orbit.

On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to £20,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space – something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space," he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Lab-grown steak can be produced on Earth, but can it be created in space?&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: "precision" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We can make all the elements to make food," says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;The brick-coloured "food" is grown in a small biorector, a mini-version of which has been sent into space &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising – even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in.

By 2023, that figure increased to 0.5 percent—a rise of over 66 percent in just four years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It means that one in five heart attack patients are now younger than 40. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some experts have pointed to the Covid virus as a possible cause due to the strain it puts on the heart and its link to blood flow issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conspiracy theorists have also linked the rise to the Covid vaccines, though there is no evidence linking the shots to widespread heart attacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, a top cardiologist has revealed to DailyMail.com four factors he blames, based on the literature and his experience in the clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai in New York, said there had been a notable shift in prescription drug use among young people which could be playing a role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heart attacks among 18- to 44-year-olds increased 66 percent between 2019 and 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Prescription drug abuse &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adderall and Ritalin prescriptions surged by 14 percent during the pandemic, driven largely by the rapid rise of telehealth platforms and relaxed regulations that made it easier to obtain prescriptions through virtual consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between 2019 and 2022, roughly 5.9 million new stimulant scripts were written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increase was especially pronounced among young adults aged 20 to 39, who experienced a 30 percent rise in Schedule II stimulant prescriptions during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr. Levine, this dramatic spike in usage 'undoubtedly played a role' in the rise in heart attacks observed within this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adderall - a stimulant medication used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - can increase the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular events when misused, as noted by the American College of Cardiology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Evan Levine, a cardiologist at a major university hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The medication, which is taken by over 16million adults in the US, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13835837/Common-prescription-drug-taken-tens-millions-linked-five-fold-increase-mental-breakdown.html"&gt;increases attention and decreases hyperactivity &lt;/a&gt;in ADHD patients by increasing levels of dopamine (described as the feel-good hormone) in the brain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite being a commonly prescribed treatment, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency classifies Adderall as a Schedule II drug, the same status as cocaine - meaning they both have a high potential to be abused. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The feeling of euphoria the medication provides can lead to tolerance or dependence - both of which can prompt a patient to take higher doses of Adderall to achieve its effects. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This can cause an addiction to the medication over time. Some common signs of Adderall abuse include increased heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, sweating, restlessness and dilated pupils. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At times, the medication can also constrict blood vessels and hamper blood flow which in turn, can increase the heart rate and blood pressure and increase chances of having an attack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Excessive intake of Adderall can increase the risks of having a stroke or a heart attack as it can increase the overall heart rate and blood pressure higher than the baseline. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Spontaneous coronary artery dissection &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A tear in the artery wall can allow blood to pool between the layers of the organ and obstruct blood flow to the heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an emergency condition where the wall of a coronary artery tears, potentially leading to a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is commonly seen in young woman and most times, after they give birth, Dr Levine told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact cause of the condition remains unknown, hormonal fluctuations, inflammation and possible underlying conditions like fibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal growth of tissue within the walls of medium and large arteries) are suspected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;SCAD is becoming more prevalent, especially among younger adults and women for reasons still being understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the past 25 years, studies have shown a clear rise in SCAD cases, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A tear in the artery wall can allow blood to pool between the layers of the heart and obstruct blood flow to the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This interruption of blood supply can deprive the heart muscles of oxygen and other essential nutrients, which can lead to damage and a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine said it is essential that experts find 'more sensitive methods' to detect SCAD in young people to avoid cases of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Crime-related stress &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Personal experiences, shared stories of near-death due to rampant crime and mass hysteria can cause psychological, emotional and physical impact on the human body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stress can have a major impact on health - from affecting sleep to raising blood pressure, not getting enough shut eye can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while work-related stress has often been the focus, Dr Levine told DailyMail.com that stress from crime may be a major contributor to early heart attacks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cardiologist told DailyMail.com 'society has fallen apart over a number of years with fear of crime in so many [people]', which can lead to stress in the body and affect heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the 2024 FBI crime report suggests a decrease in violent crimes including murder, homicide and car jackings, a study by Statista suggests 64 percent of Americans feel like there is more crime now in the country now than in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Personal experiences, shared stories of near-death due to rampant crime and mass hysteria can have a psychological, emotional and physical impact on the human body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to stress responses ranging from anxiety and fear to more long-term conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While stress itself cannot directly cause a heart attack, it can significantly contribute to the risk by increasing blood pressure and affecting blood flow, which can pose a risk for heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Obesity &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 100 million or 40.3 percent of Americans are suffering from obesity across the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And studies estimate over 370,000 deaths per year in the US are linked to excessive body weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obesity can raise cholesterol and blood pressure and lead to Type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-c4dad930-1eeb-11f0-b6a2-a344cd87ec8b" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; - all of which increase risks for heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Individuals with a BMI of 30 or higher need more blood to supply oxygen and nutrients to their bodies, which forces the heart to beat with more pressure to keep up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extra weight also gives the body volume, which creates more resistance for the heart to overcome as it pumps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The larger volume and increased resistance can result in the heart having to work much harder almost all the time. Since the organ is made of only muscle, the increased workload can cause pressure in the walls and increase blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High blood pressure is one of the most &lt;span&gt;common causes of heart attack and is the leading cause of death in obese individuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, a group of researchers from across the globe found performing at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14559961/weekend-warriors-exercise-two-days-cancer.html"&gt;over the span of two days&lt;/a&gt; had similar health benefits as to working out the entire week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who only exercised on two days had a 32 percent lower risk of death from all causes, a 31 percent lower chance of dying from cardiovascular disease and a 21 percent lower risk of dying from cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Heart Association recommends adults engage in moderate-intensity aerobic activity for about 150 minutes per week, 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the video with Edwards that has just come to light, CHD once again uses the situation to disparage MMR vaccines. Someone off camera asks Edwards if he had never had measles before, to which he replies that he had gotten an MMR vaccine as a kid, though he didn't know if he had gotten one or the recommended two doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That doesn't work then, does it?" the off-camera person asks, referring to the MMR vaccine. "No, apparently not, " Edwards replies. "Just wear[s] off."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears Edwards had a breakthrough infection, which is rare, but it does occur. They're more common in people who have only gotten one dose, which is possibly the case for Edwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single dose of MMR is 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses are 97 percent effective. In either case, the protection is considered lifelong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While up to 97 percent effectiveness is extremely protective, some people do not mount protective responses and are still vulnerable to an infection upon exposure. However, their illnesses will likely be milder than if they had not been vaccinated. In the video, Edwards described his illness as a "mild case."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data on the outbreak demonstrates the effectiveness of vaccination. &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;As of April 18&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials have identified 597 measles cases, leading to 62 hospitalizations and two deaths in school-aged, unvaccinated children with no underlying medical conditions. Most of the cases have been in unvaccinated children. Of the 597 cases, 12 (2 percent) had received two MMR doses previously, and 10 (1.6 percent) had received one dose. The remaining 99 percent of cases are either unvaccinated or have no record of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the video, Edwards tells CHD he's "doing what any doctor should be doing."&lt;/p&gt;

However, they’re far from the only nutrient to consider. Saturated fat and sodium’s roles in blood sugar may not be as obvious, but they’re just as important for diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 34.1 million people in the United States have diabetes. And while there isn’t a universal eating plan for managing this condition, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends focusing on an overall balanced eating pattern, including limiting foods that are high in saturated fat and sodium. Here, dietitians explain why paying attention to saturated fat and sodium is important for managing blood sugar levels, along with other strategies for maintaining a balanced, diabetes-friendly diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Pay Attention To Saturated Fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7595261/whats-the-difference-between-saturated-fat-and-unsaturated-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Saturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Saturated fats&lt;/a&gt; are solid at room temperature. They’re typically found in animal-based foods, like cheese, butter, milk and meat, though they’re also found in plant-based oils, including coconut oil. While there’s some debate about whether all saturated fat is harmful, high intake of saturated fat has been linked with an increased risk of heart disease, a condition that people with diabetes are already at a higher risk for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to heart health, too much saturated fat may affect blood sugar levels by increasing the risk of insulin resistance, making it harder for glucose to move out of the bloodstream and into cells.&lt;a href="https://nutritiouslysimple.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kathy Levin, RDN, CDCES, dipACLM;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Kathy Levin, RDN, CDCES, dipACLM&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle medicine dietitian, diabetes educator and founder at Nutritiously Simple, says, “Saturated fat, especially from meat and dairy, can increase insulin resistance, making it harder to manage glucose levels. Fat does not raise blood glucose directly the way carbohydrates do, but it can affect blood glucose in terms of digestion of food, insulin sensitivity and overall metabolic health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturated fat also indirectly affects blood sugar levels thanks to its effects on insulin action. &lt;a href="https://www.lpnutritionconsulting.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Plunkett, RDN, LD, CDCES;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Plunkett, RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist, says, “Dietary fat profoundly impacts insulin action over time. In the short term, the initial insulin response is often slower and lower, but the total insulin needed may still be significant, depending on the fat type and amount.” This interaction is particularly important for people who take insulin to manage their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin recommends limiting saturated fat to 10% or less of daily calories. “For somebody consuming 1500 calories, that would be about 16 grams or less a day. Look at the nutrition facts label, and aim for saturated fat as close to zero as possible,” she says. Keep in mind, this doesn’t mean you should limit all fat. Instead, opt for unsaturated fats when possible, including plant-based, whole-food sources like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil. Fatty fish, like salmon, are also beneficial thanks to their rich concentration of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, which may help reduce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8001058/best-healthy-fats-for-diabetes-according-to-a-dietitian/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 5 Best Healthy Fats to Eat If You Have Diabetes, According to a Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The 5 Best Healthy Fats to Eat If You Have Diabetes, According to a Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Pay Attention to Sodium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you have other complications, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease, people with diabetes are encouraged to limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg per day, which is the same guideline for healthy adults. While exceeding this amount won’t directly cause your blood sugar levels to spike, it can lead to hypertension (high blood pressure), which is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to understand the link between sodium and blood sugar levels. However, one study found that treatments focused on balancing sodium levels were linked with better recovery and survival odds in people hospitalized with hyperglycemia. To help prevent hypertension, focus on eating more minimally processed, low-sodium foods, especially ones that are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rich in potassium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rich in potassium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect to consider is that foods high in sodium—like fast food, packaged snacks and fried foods—also tend to be high in saturated fat and low in fiber. “Highly processed, salty foods often contain refined carbs, and additives that [may] increase systemic inflammation and worsen insulin resistance. Choosing lower-sodium, whole food options supports both stable blood sugar and reduced inflammation,” says Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Strategies to Manage Blood Sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many factors affect blood sugar management, including overall eating patterns, exercise habits, sleep and stress management. Here are some tips for keeping your blood sugar levels within a healthy range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move Your Body&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise has been shown to improve blood sugar levels, including lowering hemoglobin A1C. Physical activity makes cells more sensitive to insulin, helping to lower blood sugar levels up to 24 hours after activity. Find a type of activity you enjoy and commit to it. Start small and build your way up gradually. If you’re new to exercise, it’s important to talk with your doctor first. Because exercise can lower blood sugar levels, your medication regimen may need to be adjusted to prevent your levels from dropping too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Manage Stress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is an unavoidable, and sometimes necessary, part of life. However, being chronically stressed can contribute to insulin resistance and weight gain. “Stress can have long-lasting glucose-raising effects,” says Plunkett. She adds that developing tools to help manage stress is key for supporting metabolic and mental health. “Focusing on deep breathing, sitting quietly device-free, changing your environment (even for a few minutes) or going for a walk can lower feelings of stress, decrease blood glucose and support overall metabolism,” says Plunkett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Work With a Professional&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve been newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for years, working with a diabetes professional is one of the best ways to help manage blood sugar levels. Working one-on-one with a professional can ensure that your treatment plan is tailored to your needs and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eat More Fiber&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fiber-rich foods are naturally low in fat and contribute to insulin sensitivity, particularly by decreasing inflammation. Higher fiber diets are well known for decreasing a person's risk of developing metabolic disease and lowering hemoglobin A1C levels (three-month average of blood sugar),” says Plunkett. Adding fiber to your meal can also help slow the absorption of sugar, minimizing the risk of blood sugar spikes. Plus, fiber is beneficial for weight loss and supports brain, gut and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans fall short of their daily fiber needs, which are 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. Luckily, adding more fiber to your diet doesn’t have to be difficult. “Swap meat for legumes, like lentils, chickpeas or edamame. They are a great source of protein and fiber. This combination can assist in reducing inflammation, post-meal blood sugar spikes and improve gut health and insulin sensitivity,” says Levin. In addition to legumes, she recommends eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds. Specifically, Levin says that she encourages her clients to eat 30 different plant-based foods throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Factors To Consider&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep, smoking habits and medication regimens are additional factors to consider when managing blood sugar levels. Technology, such as continuous glucose monitors, can also be helpful for tracking blood sugar levels and adjusting your treatment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to managing diabetes. Nutrients like fat, sodium and fiber also play a key role in keeping blood sugar levels within a healthy range. Eating an overall balanced diet, with an emphasis on whole, plant-based foods like vegetables and legumes, can help limit your intake of saturated fat and sodium while also increasing your intake of fiber and other essential nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for a long time, there are things you can do to manage your blood sugar. Focus on one change at a time and don’t hesitate to ask for help. To help make getting the help you need more affordable, consider reaching out to your insurance provider. Depending on your coverage, the costs of working with a diabetes expert may be fully or partially covered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/two-surprising-nutrients-may-impact-blood-sugar-11718212" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 23:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5FY0FBTTRSX21YR2tWci1UMTJfWkt4enRiZ0F5ZndNR29YZXJsOWZpWmc2RWVVMm5KVlhVbkVpZnB2UHFLZUQ1akZCV2JvN291eHMwc3pIUWl4SVdKaWhxdlljbWdteE4zc0hlZ0RBZUVYYnN1MXg4</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，这两种令人惊讶的营养素可能会影响您的血糖- EatingWell | These 2 Surprising Nutrients May Impact Your Blood Sugar, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPeWxXeDUtLUEtSjVRbXNIakZGcEZBRldYbXpLRF9OeExOYzhXRHJ2TUZsSkVIRDVjSFRwaXpPaU8zNVVwX25JRGgzenYxNmJIenRxdGlONjRTd0VSX2d5QlFsdl8zOWZ0YnFUd2NweEowREE0YWwxVTR1bUVUUTNCVUY4d3NoYjlDQmw4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep, smoking habits and medication regimens are additional factors to consider when managing blood sugar levels. Technology, such as continuous glucose monitors, can also be helpful for tracking blood sugar levels and adjusting your treatment plan.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbohydrates are just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to managing diabetes. Nutrients like fat, sodium and fiber also play a key role in keeping blood sugar levels within a healthy range. Eating an overall balanced diet, with an emphasis on whole, plant-based foods like vegetables and legumes, can help limit your intake of saturated fat and sodium while also increasing your intake of fiber and other essential nutrients. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you are newly diagnosed or have had diabetes for a long time, there are things you can do to manage your blood sugar. Focus on one change at a time and don’t hesitate to ask for help. To help make getting the help you need more affordable, consider reaching out to your insurance provider. Depending on your coverage, the costs of working with a diabetes expert may be fully or partially covered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Fast food chains are often just tasty indulgences offering a convenient way to grab a meal. But when the craving strikes and you want to get your hands on a greasy burger or handful of fries, sometimes you may want to strike a bit of a balance, health-wise, with your order. That's when it comes in handy to know which chains are sizzling up exactly what you're looking for when it comes to nutrition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a 2024 study conducted by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplushcare.com%2Fblog%2Fmost-least-healthy-items-fast-food%2F&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.delish.com%2Ffood-news%2Fa64542959%2Fmost-unhealthy-fast-food-burger-america%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PlushCare;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;PlushCare&lt;/a&gt;, some fast food restaurants are much more unhealthy than others. Particularly Five Guys, which scored the number one spot in a ranking of the unhealthiest cheeseburgers, with a 50-point "unhealthiness score." Five Guys fries also weighed in as the unhealthiest, with 28 points on the score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whataburger, Smash Burger, and Carl's Jr. trailed behind in the ranking. Five Guys, however, had 73 percent more saturated fat than any other fast food cheeseburger on the list. That's...tough to swallow (literally).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Courtesy of PlushCare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine scores, the site analyzed each menu item's calories, sugar, saturated fat, and sodium content based on the Department of Health's nutrient profiling method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, healthy eating comes down to taking control of what you eat," the online healthcare platform reported. "That might mean avoiding fast food altogether, but it can be as simple as making an informed decision about which &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a61039585/these-are-the-top-10-fast-food-chains-in-america/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fast-food chains;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fast-food chains&lt;/a&gt; to visit and which of their products to choose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burger King and McDonald's, somewhat shockingly, tied for second-lowest unhealthiness scores at just 18 points. Cheeseburgers from those chains pack a quarter of the saturated fat (a.k.a what leads to heart disease risk and weight gain) compared to a &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a19695099/best-burger-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cheeseburger;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cheeseburger&lt;/a&gt; at Five Guys, and less than half of a Wendy's burger. The lowest was Culver's, coming in at 17 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the unhealthiest &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g3305/chicken-sandwich-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chicken sandwich;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chicken sandwich&lt;/a&gt;, another coveted fast food menu item, Popeyes' beloved sammie scored 39 points, earning the title as unhealthiest, while McDonald's once again ranked as the healthiest. The McChicken had nearly half the unhealthiness points of Burger King (31 points) and KFC (27 points) with just 14. Ok, we see you Micky D's!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Courtesy of PlushCare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, a caveat: while the McChicken is indeed health&lt;em&gt;ier&lt;/em&gt;, PlushCare points out that it doesn't necessarily make it a healthy sandwich. "While the McChicken is significantly less unhealthy than other &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/a64265239/best-fast-food-burger-fan-reactions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fast-food;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fast-food&lt;/a&gt; chicken burgers, it is still high in sodium, fat, and calories. Because it is made of ground chicken patty, the nutrients it does contain are not high-quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily for &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a41983395/homemade-chicken-nuggets-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nugget;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;nugget&lt;/a&gt; lovers, you can rest easy knowing McDonald's beloved McNuggets were rated as the healthiest of all nugget options, solidifying their spot in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 22:44:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9rTGtQb1gtWnNDWWJWbGxXeGl3eEhESDk3Z2Vnb0pVcE5uQXk1VWZ6UWIyeWJNY0NwRG5QOXdJaHNaZU42R0d5NWNzSE5IaEtHM2pGQWhnNS0yd1V3OUlFbHhCb29YcmVUZzc4UVViZ25sY3ZI</guid></item><item><title>随着蜱虫季节的开始，另一种可传播的疾病即将来临： Powassan病毒- Star Tribune | As tick season starts, another transmittable illness looms: Powassan virus - Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQajJvQUVJM1VFYTlrWUNZbGNlRzBGX0Z5M0VjSlJJVVljdkktd3NvUmJaTklucjRDMUpiSUlnWTlTRHhsbDFOUUYxRDQzNW4tT2hJOFJqSU1NQVpCX2wtWW1JWHBOTjVSQW1TUXlTblk0bU9jeGxMX2JBTlotUUNjdkpyNmo2Ty1LUE1raWY0QTdTQmluQ0VCblRFNlk5bVM2VVVaMkFtMmpqYklwQVdr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Ticks can spread Lyme disease and give people &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/lone-star-tick-bites-are-making-people-allergic-to-meat-but-minnesota-cases-are-a-mystery-cdc/600292959" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.startribune.com/lone-star-tick-bites-are-making-people-allergic-to-meat-but-minnesota-cases-are-a-mystery-cdc/600292959"&gt;red meat allergies&lt;/a&gt;, and now there’s increasing worry in Minnesota about another ailment spread by the blood-sucking pests: the Powassan virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;While the Powassan virus is uncommon compared to other tick-borne diseases in the state, it is among the most serious, said Elizabeth Schiffman, epidemiologist supervisor at the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). Carried by blacklegged ticks (more commonly known as deer ticks) the Powassan virus can cause neurological damage and, in rare cases, death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Last year, there were 14 reported cases in Minnesota — the highest reported since recordkeeping on the disease started in 2008, according to MDH data. In 2011, the state recorded the first death caused by the virus after a woman in her 60s died of &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/northern-minnesota-woman-dies-of-tick-borne-disease/124719748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.startribune.com/northern-minnesota-woman-dies-of-tick-borne-disease/124719748"&gt;a brain infection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;“The risks are relatively low, however, all the tick prevention that you would do to keep yourself from getting one of those more common diseases will also help keep you safe from getting Powassan,” Schiffman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;It’s likely that many people who are infected with the Powassan virus don’t show the symptoms or only have mild symptoms, she said.

Aliota is studying the virus in two of the nation’s epicenters over the course of the five-year grant: Minnesota and New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Star Tribune</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 22:30:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxQajJvQUVJM1VFYTlrWUNZbGNlRzBGX0Z5M0VjSlJJVVljdkktd3NvUmJaTklucjRDMUpiSUlnWTlTRHhsbDFOUUYxRDQzNW4tT2hJOFJqSU1NQVpCX2wtWW1JWHBOTjVSQW1TUXlTblk0bU9jeGxMX2JBTlotUUNjdkpyNmo2Ty1LUE1raWY0QTdTQmluQ0VCblRFNlk5bVM2VVVaMkFtMmpqYklwQVdr</guid></item><item><title>六种“沉默”的癌症在男性和女性中悄然涌现......及其微妙的症状-每日邮报 | The six 'silent' cancers quietly surging in men and women... and their subtle symptoms - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQbXpCUHpvRHduVG43U3JXbWFHcnZMejlIcWdiLWt2dkE4Mjg2NG5pekQ1SjZaMVhzMC1JVkM1eGh0dEZ4NGN3Ukt1VjRRUVZxYjVTT001NzNZdHRzZHZ4dmptc2RaQlVOVTZ2UEFpUDJRdThpN2NZdjFkVmJOS2lNSlV3N3pDU2ZNX2padmNPckRmQ05XRnZDemdKcDVXS3NPTWFNUVBZWkNuTHNMT05tejRBMHFnQ0540gG-AUFVX3lxTE9YbTNLMldKaTNXM0NGRlBwTjNyYVpOajhNLXppTWhLaERsOU80ZjlkdW0tLTNaX0RxV1VWMm4zT25USlZEZ3JqUEhCN3JyZFo3dzdYR0NuZU1QYmdUVVBtd3AwdGhYNk9tRmhoaUFHdEN2RmY0UUtEM0s3MEkxZjZJeGFQcm1nQXZFeXBmanlMVTFuVThXaFhiS3NSWFUwVEJRbFo4OURvT0pWSnVnOEZSeTZuZUhMZmNJaDFXZmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Deaths caused by most forms of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-e7347ae0-1edc-11f0-b170-9f0e11004cf7"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; are falling across the US, according to a major annual report, but still, there are several types of the disease that continue to have rising fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new report from the NIH and American Heart Association (AHA) shows overall cancer deaths have declined steadily over the past 20 years — even during the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-aa821f00-1edf-11f0-a2fc-232d4df57398" class=""&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic — with annual decreases of 1.7 percent for men and 1.3 percent for women between 2018 and 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13735093/Cancer-deaths-men-predicted-surge-2050-global-study-reveals-rise-younger-people-disease.html"&gt;cancer rates in men&lt;/a&gt; remained steady from 2013 to 2021 (not counting the unusual year of 2020), but &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14296699/american-doctors-detect-alarming-shift-cancer-patients.html"&gt;for women&lt;/a&gt;, rates slowly increased by about 0.3 percent each year from 2003 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer death rates in children have steadily declined, and rates among teens and young adults have also dropped—though progress has recently slowed. Advances in treatment, early detection, and supportive care have played a big role in improving survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But deaths from melanoma and other skin cancers, as well as those of the mouth and pharynx, bones and joints, pancreas, uterus, and liver, are increasing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say several factors are to blame, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13404251/Obesity-linked-cancers-major-study.html"&gt;high rates of obesity&lt;/a&gt;, which drives pancreatic, uterine, and liver cancer-causing inflammation, hormone imbalances, and delayed or difficult diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An aging population also fuels cancers, such as those of the bones, pancreas, and liver, since older cells have had more time to accumulate DNA damage — and weaker immune systems make it harder to fight disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And lack of access to early detection tools affects nearly all cancers, especially oral and skin cancers, which can often go unnoticed or misdiagnosed until later stages when treatment is more difficult, contributing to higher mortality.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Increased deaths from liver, pancreas, uterine, bone, oral, and skin cancers are driven by high obesity rates, viral infections, an aging population, and limited access to early detection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the cancers with rising rates, symptoms often begin subtly, not prompting someone to seek medical care right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma, a serious skin cancer, often appears as a new or changing mole that may itch, bleed, or fail to fade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancers of the mouth and throat can cause persistent sores, swallowing difficulties, hoarseness, or unusual lumps. Bone and joint cancers frequently lead to worsening pain (especially at night), swelling, or unexpected fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer may cause upper abdominal pain, jaundice (the yellowing of the skin and eyes), and digestive issues. Liver and bile duct cancers typically cause jaundice, right-sided abdominal pain, and unexplained weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uterine cancer often reveals itself through abnormal vaginal bleeding or pelvic pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these symptoms can have other causes, persistent or worsening signs warrant immediate medical attention for proper evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.35833"&gt;Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;tracks new cancer cases, deaths, and trends in the US, using data from the NIH, CDC, National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers drew from CDC programs and US Census data to account for demographic shifts and examined the impact of Covid, focusing on how the pandemic disrupted early detection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While the death rates fell overall, certain cancers showed increases in mortality rates from 2018 to 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-mol-fe-xpmodule-comment-cta="true" data-article-id="14632737" data-channel="health" data-environment="production" data-platform="mol.web.desktop" data-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14632737/six-silent-cancers-quietly-surging-men-women-subtle-symptoms.html" data-version="1.1.4" data-reactroot=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They analyzed monthly trends in eight cancers—mainly those typically caught through screenings or routine care—across multiple registries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the state level, the researchers looked at how cancer rates where linked to how different states handled the pandemic with three specific factors: how strict the state’s Covid restrictions were, how many people died from Covid, and how much mammogram use changed from 2018 to 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States with more stringent Covid policies – like masking and school closures – experienced larger declines in cancer incidence, particularly for cancers like female breast, thyroid, and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These differences were minimal, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there was some correlation between the severity of Covid restrictions and cancer incidence declines, this geographic component did not fully explain the decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other factors like Covid death rates and changes in mammography utilization were also considered, but did not show a significant impact on the decline at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report showed death rates in men increased among cancers of the pancreas (0.3 percent per year), bones and joints (1.8 percent), oral cavity and pharynx (2.1 percent), and non-melanoma skin cancer (2.4 percent) from 2018 to 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This set of four US maps shows how the Covid pandemic may have affected cancer care. The first map shows where cancer diagnoses dropped the most from 2019 to 2020. The second shows how strict Covid policies were in each state. The third highlights areas with the highest Covid death rates. The fourth shows where breast cancer screenings (mammograms) declined the most between 2018 and 2020&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In women, death rates increased for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (up 1.1 percent), corpus and uterus (1.1 percent), liver and intrahepatic bile duct (0.7 percent), and pancreas (0.2 percent) during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Progress in reducing cancer deaths overall is largely the result of declines in both incidence and death rates for lung cancer and several other smoking-related cancers, according to the NIH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New diagnoses and deaths from lung cancer, for example, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-8620971/Lung-cancer-deaths-falling-nearly-5-year-2001-thanks-better-treatment.html"&gt;have declined&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women over the past 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report does not provide a specific explanation for why death rates for certain cancers rose, but &lt;span&gt;are likely linked to a combination of factors such as delays in early detection, limited advances in treatment, or the aggressive nature of these cancers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, tobacco use is a known contributor to oral cancer, while diet and obesity are known risk factors for cancers of all types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 2001 to 2022, the cancer death rate among children from newborn to 14 dropped by 1.5 percent per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Death rates for adolescents and young adults also declined until recently, when the decline slowed and stabilized, the NIH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The childhood cancer incidence rate began to decrease by 0.8 percent per year starting in 2015 after increasing by 1.3 percent per year since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pediatric cancer care has made significant progress over the past few decades, including chemotherapy, surgeries, and targeted immunotherapies, causing survival rates to tick up.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers also reported that the overall number of cancer cases in the US was about 461 per 100,000 people, with men seeing higher rates than women&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2020, the rate of new cancer diagnoses was about eight percent lower than expected. This drop is attributed to pandemic-related disruptions in healthcare, which affected routine screenings, doctor visits, and access to healthcare services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cancer death rates generally continued to decrease during the period 2018–2022, with an average annual decrease of 1.7 percent for men and 1.3 percent for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the pandemic may have influenced this trend, particularly in 2020, when diagnoses were likely delayed and cancers were detected at later stages when they are often harder to treat and have a lower survival rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found no evidence of data issues or reporting delays; the 2020 decline was real and significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to men, the death rate from lung and bronchus cancer in women decreased the fastest, with an average annual drop of 3.4 percent from 2018 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also reported that the overall number of cancer cases in the US during the four years combined was about 461 per 100,000 people, with men seeing higher rates than women. Rates among men declined from 2001 to 2013 and remained stable through 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The researchers observed notable monthly trends in cancer incidence, specifically identifying decreases during certain months that were likely linked to reduced medical visits during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From 2001 to 2013, cancer rates in men dropped by about 1.6% to 2.2% each year, and then stayed steady through 2021. For women, cancer rates didn’t drop—instead, they rose slightly, going up by about 0.3% each year from 2003 to 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among women, rates have slowly risen since 2003; specifically, eight of the most common cancers, including breast, uterine, pancreatic, and stomach cancers. Stomach cancer had the steepest rise, particularly among Black women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among men, rates rose for cancers like prostate, pancreas, and testicular cancer but declined for lung, brain, and colorectal cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostate cancer had the sharpest increase, especially among API men, while lung cancer saw the most significant decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people had the highest overall cancer rates, followed by White and Black populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Asian/Pacific Islander (API) people had the lowest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From 2018 to 2022, cancer deaths decreased for each major racial and ethnic population group,’ the NIH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-a0850b70-1ed0-11f0-a2fc-232d4df57398" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14632737/six-silent-cancers-quietly-surging-men-women-subtle-symptoms.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Leading deadly cancers: Know the signs &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma (a type of skin cancer) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;New or changing mole (size, shape, color)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Itching, bleeding, or not healing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oral Cavity &amp;amp; Pharynx Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent mouth sore or pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trouble swallowing or hoarseness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Lump in mouth or neck&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bone &amp;amp; Joint Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Bone or joint pain (often worse at night)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling or a lump&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Easy fractures&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Jaundice (yellow skin/eyes)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Weight loss, nausea, greasy stools&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uterine (Corpus) Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Abnormal vaginal bleeding&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver &amp;amp; Bile Duct Cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Upper-right abdominal pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Swelling, weight loss, fatigue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers found associations between memory performance and cardiovascular risk factors, immune markers, and Alzheimer’s biomarkers (amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration) in individuals aged 24–44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, these early-life cognitive differences emerged even without clinical symptoms of decline. The findings suggest that prevention strategies should begin in young adulthood to effectively reduce long-term Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Onset Signals:&lt;/strong&gt; Alzheimer’s-linked biomarkers were associated with cognitive function in people as young as 24.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Risk Score:&lt;/strong&gt; The CAIDE score, which includes lifestyle and genetic risk factors, correlated with memory performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATN Biomarkers Detected:&lt;/strong&gt; Amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration markers were linked to cognition before midlife, though APOE risk was not yet apparent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Columbia University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and the Columbia Butler Aging Center suggests that risk factors and biomarkers related to Alzheimer’s disease are associated with cognition much earlier in life than previously recognized. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights significant associations between cognition and Alzheimer’s disease risk factors as young as ages 24 to 44 and underscores the importance of early prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108927"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-24-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These earlier life associations, provide a baseline for predicting long term trajectories of cognitive decline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to systematically examine Alzheimer’s disease risk factors, including biomarkers related to cognitive impairment in a large group of generally healthy middle-aged individuals in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet- Regional Health Americas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previously, research on Alzheimer’s disease risk factors has focused on individuals aged 50 and older,” said Allison Aiello, PhD, James S. Jackson Healthy Longevity Professor of Epidemiology in the Butler Aging Center and Columbia Mailman School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The potential impact of our findings is substantial, offering clinicians and health researchers a clearer understanding of the early emergence of Alzheimer’s disease risk factors and their association with cognition before middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Aiello, the results reveal that several well-established risk factors and blood biomarkers are linked to cognitive function even before midlife. These earlier life associations, provide a baseline for predicting long term trajectories of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, we learned that certain Alzheimer’s risk factors—such as cardiovascular health, ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), and immune biomarkers—are present and related to cognition in individuals in their forties and even earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aiello and colleagues used the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score, which covers factors like age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol, physical activity, and the gene variant apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) which is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from Waves IV and V of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which tracked a nationally representative cohort of adolescents since 1994-1995 through multiple follow-up waves. About half of the participants in Wave IV were female (48.4–52.1%), and just over 70 percent (71.4–72.5%) were White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, Wave IV consisted of data from up to 11, 449 individuals aged 24-34. The researchers conducted in-home interviews, cognitive tests, physical exams, and gathered blood samples from 4,507 participants. In Wave V, both in-person and web/mail surveys were directed to participants aged 34-44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total of 1,112 participants who received in-home interviews, were given cognitive tasks such as immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span and provided a sample for genetic testing. Scores on the cognitive tasks were linked to the overall CAIDE score in 529 individuals at Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exploring the relationship between the CAIDE score and cognitive function in young adulthood and early midlife in the U.S., showed that significant associations with cardiovascular risk factors can be observed well before age 50,” Aiello explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, biologically — genetic, neurological, immune, and inflammatory biomarkers have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers—collectively known as ATN—are increasingly viewed as promising indicators for predicting Alzheimer’s disease risk in older populations. ATN biomarker and several immune markers showed associations with cognitive function before midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a key genetic risk factor, APOE, did not appear to affect participants in these middle years and may not become evident until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our overall findings suggest that blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease are linked to differences in cognitive function decades before clinical symptoms and impairments even appear, highlighting the importance of early prevention strategies across the life course,” Aiello noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying the early pathways to Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive impairment before older age is critical to slowing the expected rise of Alzheimer’s disease in the coming decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors are Jennifer Momkus, Chantel L.

We cross-sectionally analyzed weighted survey and biomarker data from Waves IV and V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score comprised of age, education, sex, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesteroal, and physical activity and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also measured total Tau and Neurofilament light (NfL), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Outcomes included immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analytic sample sizes ranged from 4507 to 11,449 participants in Wave IV and from 529 to 1121 participants in Wave V. The survey-weighted median (IQR) age was 28 (26–29) years in Wave IV and 38 (36–29) years in Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half of the survey-weighted Wave IV participants were female (48.4–52.1% across analytic samples), 71.4–72.5% were White, 12.5–14.9% were Black, and 9.3–10.2% were Hispanic. In Wave V, 43.6–46.8% were female, 68.7–69.3% were White, 17.1%–20.0% were Black, and 7.3%–9.6% were Hispanic. The CAIDE score was associated with all cognition measures in Wave IV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, among adults aged 24–34, each 1-point increase in CAIDE was associated with a 0.03 standard deviation lower backward digit span score (95% CI: −0.04, −0.02). Total Tau was associated with immediate word recall in Wave V (β = −0.13, 95% CI: −0.23, −0.04). Wave IV hsCRP and IL-10 and Wave V IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 were also associated with lower cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key risk factors for Alzheimer’s Disease are linked to cognitive function as early as ages 24–44, highlighting the need for early prevention in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NIHP01HD31921, U01AG071448, U01AG071450, R01AG057800, P30AG066615, T32HD091058, P2CHD050924.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:09:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5JcTRFamxtZFd5WjhYNWg1ZjhhaDZpb0pES3FHR2xhVDFBcDAzN1d1djE4dWpUWUFwR3pTemhzQk1BcE5CTzViNTRPQ1R4dTd5M0FFWDRWMW1HMWpPMVMzTS1UVXNXejlkSzZVN0FDczd1Yzg</guid></item><item><title>突破性药物恢复视力：研究人员成功逆转视网膜损伤- SciTechDaily | Breakthrough Drug Restores Vision: Researchers Successfully Reverse Retinal Damage - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSVVYYVBYajlmdTZNU1FHYmViQjVXUlhUVFRYMFRpdnlDdkZLeVExVVJPa3M2dmVCWUhkWXk1d25lYzVCMVhVMExja0YyY3VqbnhMUkJDdFhKMHhCUk5tcXZpZV9CdGFvcnZsaXAwSF8xUzFBMkc2RHl0S0FNemJvMXNHdkhDSklKTUl1M0ZfVHhzanJGMXQ4OWUtcE4zRG0tRlhNaVd1SzR6QVk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 21:04:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSVVYYVBYajlmdTZNU1FHYmViQjVXUlhUVFRYMFRpdnlDdkZLeVExVVJPa3M2dmVCWUhkWXk1d25lYzVCMVhVMExja0YyY3VqbnhMUkJDdFhKMHhCUk5tcXZpZV9CdGFvcnZsaXAwSF8xUzFBMkc2RHl0S0FNemJvMXNHdkhDSklKTUl1M0ZfVHhzanJGMXQ4OWUtcE4zRG0tRlhNaVd1SzR6QVk</guid></item><item><title>高蛋白柠檬鸡ORZO - EatingWell | High-Protein Lemon Chicken Orzo - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTFBhclVfTUx0TFdUanRiRktCN2lFMlVHdklDZFQ0Yy1vSGdHLXVlTmlBUlNKZzl5S2pPT244MFRtSUxZdHhwckdxQ2pTQ2diWGpYb2tfZnEtdmRHbGJPcVpkY1lpM2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mm-recipes-intro__content_1-0" class="comp mm-recipes-intro__content mntl-sc-page mntl-block" data-sc-sticky-offset="190" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="1" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This one-skillet &lt;strong&gt;Lemon Chicken Orzo&lt;/strong&gt; is the flavorful weeknight dinner you’ve been looking for.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Toasting the orzo enhances its flavor, adding a nutty richness that wouldn’t be achieved otherwise. Coating the orzo in oil also helps prevent it from sticking and allows for even cooking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To save time, consider using shredded rotisserie chicken and stirring it into the other ingredients at the end.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can’t find whole-wheat orzo, regular or tricolor orzo would work well. You can also substitute chicken thighs or another cut of chicken, and including feta cheese would add some extra flavor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We recommend cooking in a cast-iron skillet, but you can also use a 12-inch stainless-steel skillet or sauté pan.&lt;/li&gt;

Spinach is especially rich in vitamin K, a nutrient that supports healthy bones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chicken broth &lt;/strong&gt;typically doesn’t add a whole lot of nutrition (though this does vary by brand). It can, however, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894212/ways-to-flush-out-excess-sodium-from-your-body/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;add a lot of sodium&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure to check the label and choose a reduced-sodium or no-salt-added broth. This also allows you to season the dish to your taste without overdoing it on sodium.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210" aria-label="study"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2025.2492210"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has identified an influenza virus circulating in pigs that shows multiple traits associated with pandemic potential. Known as H1N2, the virus belongs to a lineage of flu viruses that originated in birds, adapted to pigs, and has now been detected in humans. According to researchers, this strain—called 1C H1N2—has the ability to infect human airway cells, transmit between individuals, and escape most people’s existing immunity. These characteristics place it in a high-risk category under a pandemic risk framework published last year in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z" aria-label="Nature Communications"&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49117-z"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenza A viruses are not exclusive to humans. They also infect birds, pigs, horses, and other animals. In pigs, three main subtypes circulate: H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. These viruses are further divided into genetic lineages based on their evolutionary history. The 1C lineage emerged in Europe in 1979, when an avian flu virus crossed into pigs and contributed genetic material to a new strain. Since then, the 1C lineage has remained largely confined to swine populations in Europe and Asia—until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2011 and 2024, viruses from the 1C lineage have been detected in humans at least 29 times, with almost half of those cases occurring since 2021. Most of these cases appear to be isolated spillover events from pigs, but their increasing frequency is cause for concern. Surveillance data also suggest that individuals who work with pigs are more likely to have been exposed to these viruses, underscoring the potential for transmission at the human–animal interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-1" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Human cases of swine-origin 1C H1N2 influenza have been increasing since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;John M. Drake&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings from the new study is how little immunity most people have to the 1C H1N2 virus. In blood samples collected from U.S. adults, only about one-third showed any detectable neutralizing antibodies, and most of those were from individuals born before 1950. This limited protection appears to stem from residual immunity to the 1918-like viruses that circulated early in the 20th century. More recent generations show almost no immune recognition of 1C H1N2. Current seasonal flu vaccines also offer little to no cross-protection, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In laboratory tests, the 1C H1N2 virus displayed several traits associated with the ability to spread among humans. Like the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, it binds preferentially to receptors found in the human upper respiratory tract—an important trait for human-to-human transmission. It replicated efficiently in cultured human airway cells and remained stable in aerosol-like droplets across a range of humidity levels, mimicking the conditions respiratory viruses encounter in real-world settings. The virus also showed high neuraminidase activity, a feature that has been linked to increased transmissibility. Neuraminidase is a key protein on the virus’s surface that helps it escape from infected cells to infect new cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the virus’s ability to cross species, researchers conducted transmission experiments using pigs and ferrets—a standard model for studying influenza in humans. Infected pigs were housed near uninfected ferrets with no direct contact. While the ferrets showed no symptoms, all of them developed antibodies against the virus after exposure, indicating successful transmission. Notably, even ferrets that had prior immunity to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain became infected, suggesting that existing human immunity may not prevent spread of the 1C virus if it were to emerge more widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-2" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;Human cases of swine-origin 1C H1N2 have appeared in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;John M. Drake&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the pandemic risk assessment framework, viruses that exhibit a specific set of traits should be prioritized for surveillance. The 1C H1N2 virus checks nearly every box. It evades existing immunity in most people, binds to human-type airway receptors, and replicates efficiently in human bronchial cells. It remains stable in airborne droplets under typical humidity conditions and has a low pH of fusion—meaning its surface proteins can undergo the necessary changes for cell entry within the acidic compartments of human airway cells. In animal studies, it transmitted through the air both to naïve ferrets and to those with prior immunity to the H1N1 strain responsible for the 2009 pandemic. Taken together, these features place 1C H1N2 among the highest-risk flu viruses currently circulating in animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that meeting the biological criteria for pandemic risk does not guarantee a severe outcome. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus also spread widely and met many of the same risk thresholds, but caused relatively mild illness in most cases. That experience was a reminder that pandemics can vary in severity—and that a virus can be highly transmissible without being highly lethal. The current study does not evaluate how deadly the 1C H1N2 virus might be. In fact, infections in pigs were mild, and the virus is not classified as a highly pathogenic strain like the H5N1 avian flu currently circulating in U.S. dairy herds and poultry. Still, the ability to spread efficiently in humans—especially when combined with low levels of immunity—makes early detection and risk assessment essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergence of 1C H1N2 underscores the importance of both structured risk assessment and detailed experimental investigation. In this case, researchers combined serology, molecular virology, and animal models to evaluate a virus that would otherwise remain hidden in the background of routine surveillance. Their work demonstrates how careful, labor-intensive studies can bring clarity to potential threats before they escalate. While it remains uncertain whether this virus will ever spread widely in humans—or how severe it might be if it does—this study provides a strong scientific basis for keeping it on the radar.&lt;/p&gt;

The study identifies tandem repeat expansions (TREs) in the DMPK gene as a shared mechanism that disrupts gene splicing and contributes to ASD-like social behaviors in individuals with DM1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mis-splicing creates protein imbalances that interfere with brain development and function. The findings provide new insights into autism’s genetic pathways and could inform future precision therapies aimed at restoring protein function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Genetic Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; TREs in the DMPK gene link DM1 and ASD by disrupting gene splicing essential for brain development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with DM1 are 14 times more likely to develop autism compared to the general population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Therapies:&lt;/strong&gt; Research is underway to explore treatments that could release proteins absorbed by toxic RNA caused by TREs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Hospital for Sick Children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) and University of Las Vegas Nevada (UNLV) have uncovered a genetic link between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a rare genetic condition called myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that while ASD has previously been characterized by a loss of gene function, another mechanism may be leading to the social behaviours often observed in individuals with ASD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108923"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows DNA, a child and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/tre-genetics-ASD-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As the tandem repeat expands in the DMPK gene, the research team, including collaborators at the University of Florida and Adam Mickiewicz University (Poland), found its altered RNA binds to a protein that is involved in gene splicing regulation during brain development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;DM1 is an inherited condition which causes progressive muscle loss and weakness. While ASD is present in around one per cent of the general population, it is 14 times more likely to develop in people with DM1.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that the genetic variation that causes DM1 — tandem repeat expansions (TREs) in the DMPK gene — also impacts brain development. The research team found that the effects of TREs interfere with a critical process called gene splicing, which is essential for gene function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disruption causes a protein imbalance that can result in mis-splicing of multiple genes involved in brain function, and may explain why some of the social and behavioural outcomes of ASD develop in people with DM1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings represent a new way to characterize the genetic development of autism,” explains Dr. Ryan Yuen, Senior Scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at SickKids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By identifying the molecular pathway behind this connection, we can begin to investigate new approaches to ASD diagnosis and the development of precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are TREs? &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;TREs occur when sections of a DNA strand are repeated two or more times, and the likelihood of those repeats causing errors in gene function increases each time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020 Yuen discovered that TREs are genetic contributors to autism, identifying more than 2,588 different places in the genome where TREs were much more prevalent in people with ASD. Similarly, people with DM1 have a TRE in the DMPK gene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A variation really stood out to me that we see in rare neuromuscular disease,” says Dr. Łukasz Sznajder, a research lead and Assistant Professor at UNLV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is how we started connecting the dots. We found a molecular link, or overlap, which we believe is the core of causing autistic symptoms in children with myotonic dystrophy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Gene splicing a key contributor to the development of ASD &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the tandem repeat expands in the DMPK gene, the research team, including collaborators at the University of Florida and Adam Mickiewicz University (Poland), found its altered RNA binds to a protein that is involved in gene splicing regulation during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This so-called “toxic RNA” depletes the protein and prevents it from binding to other RNA molecules in important areas of the genome, causing a protein imbalance which results in mis-splicing other genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“TREs are like a sponge that absorbs all these important proteins from the genome. Without this protein, other areas of the genome don’t function properly,” explains Yuen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Yuen Lab and Sznajder Lab are already exploring whether this mis-splicing is happening in other genes associated with ASD, as well as how their findings could inform precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this work is already underway. In 2020, Dr. Christopher Pearson, Senior Scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at SickKids, identified a molecule that can contract TREs in Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed to identify how this could be applied to other conditions, the team remains optimistic their findings could inform future research and care for DM1, ASD and other conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the Azrieli Foundation, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation, Muscular Dystrophy Association, the UNVL startup fund, the University of Florida Centre for Autism and Neurodevelopment, the National Science Centre, Poland, SickKids Research Institute, Brain Canada, the Government of Ontario, the University of Toronto McLaughlin Centre, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), The Petroff Family Foundation, Tribute Communities, The Marigold Foundation and SickKids Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Autism and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ed8b9f8c838e889e8e8cc39d8c86ad9e848e868684899ec38e8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Francesca Pak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sickkids.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital for Sick Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01943-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Autism-related traits in myotonic dystrophy type 1 model mice are due to MBNL sequestration and RNA mis-splicing of autism-risk genes&lt;/a&gt;” by Ryan Yuen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism-related traits in myotonic dystrophy type 1 model mice are due to MBNL sequestration and RNA mis-splicing of autism-risk genes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome-wide enrichment of gene-specific tandem repeat expansions has been linked to autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such mutation is the CTG tandem repeat expansion in the 3′ untranslated region of the &lt;em&gt;DMPK&lt;/em&gt; gene, which is known to cause myotonic muscular dystrophy type 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there is a clear clinical association between autism and myotonic dystrophy, the molecular basis for this connection remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that sequestration of MBNL splicing factors by mutant DMPK RNAs with expanded CUG repeats alters the RNA splicing patterns of autism-risk genes during brain development, particularly a class of autism-relevant microexons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that both &lt;em&gt;DMPK&lt;/em&gt;-CTG expansion and &lt;em&gt;Mbnl&lt;/em&gt; null mouse models recapitulate autism-relevant mis-splicing profiles, along with social behavioral deficits and altered responses to novelty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support our model that myotonic dystrophy-associated autism arises from developmental mis-splicing of autism-risk genes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 20:27:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE51d0xvNmdCLWZGWWtwc0NIV0xqZ05TTVJRdUNSbzh3eWpjTVVXMW93UEJwdTNzV2p4QVV0dnR1Vk1xUUZHRXpicjdqWEdON3lmXzFOaGJfa3lGUTE4WnhobWRB</guid></item><item><title>由营养师制定的7天高蛋白地中海饮食计划，帮助减掉内脏脂肪- EatingWell | 7-Day High-Protein Mediterranean Diet Meal Plan to Help Lose Visceral Fat, Created by a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxORS1hblAwNjNmX1F3eXJyeFRHdkt5N2tOaUY1azltUjhrYkRNSEJ3aEN3dGM5dnZXY2RkTHlNM0ROWmRxRlhFcnJwMDA1RUFXdVZodERXWE1OcmFRS1V6WmN6VFV4TVNvTTdhcGVsYU9DbE1JdWxnR0lmczA5ZkVSN2tVWUlMR3F6ZGt1N0VJWkpiX3RBWE5BSHR6MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it’s easier for your routine to eat the same breakfast and lunch every day, go for it! Each breakfast option spans 352 to 409 calories while lunches range from 314 to 410 calories. These ranges are fairly similar, so a simple swap should work for most people. If you’re closely monitoring calories or other nutrients, you may want to make small adjustments to snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is visceral fat?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat refers to fat around the abdominal region. It can surround internal organs and increase the risk of metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It is also linked to an increase in inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_171-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/category/4274/mediterranean-diet-center/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is a popular way of eating that emphasizes protein, legumes, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats. It limits refined grains, ultra-processed foods and added sugars. This eating style is often praised for its flexibility, health benefits and nutritional quality—but does it help with weight loss? Research points to the Mediterranean diet as an effective strategy for both weight loss and a reduced risk for gaining weight over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While you can’t necessarily &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-you-target-losing-visceral-fat-8760072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;target specific areas for weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, reducing total body fat can often lead to a reduction in visceral fat. Because of its focus on whole grains, beans, lentils and ample produce, the Mediterranean diet tends to be high in fiber. Fiber is an important nutrient with many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; and research shows that it can have benefits for weight loss as well.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Perhaps most importantly, the Mediterranean diet does not restrict any particular food groups, which means it’s likely more sustainable long-term.&lt;br&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics can be a double-edged sword, especially for very young kids. Recent research has found evidence that frequent antibiotic use can raise children’s risk of childhood asthma and allergies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Rutgers University led the research, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf191/8114163"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this month in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. The study found that children given antibiotics before the age of two were noticeably more likely to be diagnosed with asthma and allergies later on, particularly the more antibiotics they took. The findings are the latest to suggest that antibiotics should be carefully managed in their use, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics are our best weapon against bacterial infections. But scientists have known for decades that they don’t come without risks. Bacteria have steadily learned how to resist these drugs, for instance, and antibiotic resistance is now one of the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superbugs-will-kill-nearly-40-million-people-over-the-next-25-years-scientists-warn-2000499745"&gt;most pressing public health issues&lt;/a&gt; of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another risk concerns the microbiome, the neighborhood of usually harmless and often helpful bacteria that live in or on our bodies. Many antibiotics are broad-spectrum, meaning they can kill a wide variety of bacteria, including these friendly bacteria. The splash damage caused by antibiotics might then &lt;a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/what-happens-to-the-gut-microbiome-after-taking-antibiotics-69970"&gt;disturb the microbiome&lt;/a&gt; in ways that could increase our risk of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Some research has suggested that antibiotic-triggered disruptions of the microbiome are even more harmful to children, with studies linking their use to chronic conditions like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10142236/"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;. But according to the Rutgers researchers, past studies had limitations—such as small sample sizes and numerous variables to account for—issues they tried to minimize in their new study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed the medical records of over one million children born in the UK. They also conducted a separate analysis of children and their siblings, allowing them to compare children with similar environmental and genetic backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that antibiotic use before age two was positively linked to a higher risk of asthma, food allergy, and allergic rhinitis (hay fever). They also found a possible association between antibiotic use and intellectual disability in general. On the positive side, they failed to find any connection between antibiotics and most other conditions they looked for, including autism spectrum disorder, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This sort of research can’t prove that antibiotics are triggering asthma in some young children, it can only suggest a correlation. But the researchers did see a higher risk of asthma in children who took more antibiotics than others, which is evidence of a dose-response effect. The same pattern was also seen when the researchers only compared children to their siblings, further strengthening a causative link.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other studies have shown that antibiotics are frequently prescribed when they shouldn’t be, such as for infections likely not caused by bacteria—a problem in children as well. A study in 2020, for instance, found that one of every four children given antibiotics in hospitals likely &lt;a href="https://medicine.washu.edu/news/1-in-4-kids-who-get-antibiotics-in-childrens-hospitals-are-prescribed-the-drugs-incorrectly/"&gt;didn’t need&lt;/a&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;So while further research might be warranted to confirm these links between antibiotics and certain chronic childhood conditions like asthma, the take-home message should remain the same: We need to rein in our use of these vital, but not risk-free, medications, perhaps even more so in kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antibiotics are important and sometimes life-saving medicines, but not all infections in young kids need to be treated with antibiotics,” said lead author Daniel Horton, an associate professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Rutgers School of Public Health, in a &lt;a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/news/frequent-use-antibiotics-infants-and-young-children-may-increase-risk-asthma-allergies-and"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “Parents should continue to consult with their children’s doctors on the best course of care.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Conducted with nearly 900 parents, the research found that while both emotions were beneficial, awe had a stronger impact on psychological richness and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awe connects parents to something larger than themselves, offering a sense of wonder that slows time and deepens emotional connection. These findings suggest that everyday moments with children—not just major milestones—can offer profound emotional rewards that help buffer the mental health challenges of parenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe improves well-being more holistically than pride by enhancing life meaning and emotional richness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Perception:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe can make time feel slower, helping parents immerse fully in special moments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Awe doesn’t require rare events—it can arise from everyday interactions like outings or shared joy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research from the University of Rochester suggests that experiencing feelings of pride and awe toward one’s children can significantly enhance parental well-being. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which will be published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;, found that these positive emotions contribute to greater life satisfaction and stronger parent-child bonds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108919"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a parent and child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parental-pride-wellbeing-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers emphasize that acknowledging these positive emotional experiences doesn’t diminish the challenges of parenthood. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Princeton Chee, conducted a series of studies involving nearly 900 parents to examine how parental pride and awe affect various aspects of well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parental pride and awe are common and beneficial feelings parents can have with their children,” explains Chee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents may feel proud when their child does something they worked hard to succeed in and accomplish. They may feel awe when their child does something amazing or completely unexpected that make them feel like saying ‘woah’ or ‘wow.'” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both emotions proved beneficial, the research showed that awe had more profound effects on overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that awe can actually strengthen parental well-being more broadly and holistically, compared to pride, making parents lives feel happier, more meaningful, and richer in experiences,” Chee notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that awe connects parents to something larger than themselves, such as the parent-child relationship or the concept of parenthood itself, while pride tends to focus more on personal ego and accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction helps explain why awe showed stronger associations with purpose, meaning, and psychological richness in parents’ lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly noteworthy was the finding that awe can alter parents’ perception of time. “Awe in particular can help parents fully immerse themselves by making time feel like it’s slowing down during extraordinary moments,” says Chee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research appears especially relevant amid growing concerns about parental mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents everywhere are struggling with mental health and well-being, with even the US surgeon general calling for an urgent need to better support parents,” Chee points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research finds that one way in which parenthood can be rewarding, rather than detrimental, is through feeling pride and especially awe with one’s child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, experiencing parental awe doesn’t require rare or exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Awe may be easier to find and cultivate than you might think,” Chee explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have to be only once in a lifetime, extraordinary experiences in which parents feel awe. These certainly are rewarding moments that elicit awe, but awe, along with its many rewards, can also be cultivated through things as simple as weekend outings and quality time spent with one’s child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that acknowledging these positive emotional experiences doesn’t diminish the challenges of parenthood. Rather, the findings suggest that cultivating and savoring moments of pride and awe can help parents find greater joy, meaning, and richness in the parenting experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this parenting and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#196a6e78757d6b7677596a696a6937766b7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stephen Waldron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://spsp.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Stephen Waldron – Society for Personality and Social Psychology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/19485506251332690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Feeling Pride and Awe in Parenthood: The Unique Emotional Rewards of Parenting on Well-Being&lt;/a&gt;” by Princeton Chee et al. &lt;em&gt;Social Psychological and Personality Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling Pride and Awe in Parenthood: The Unique Emotional Rewards of Parenting on Well-Being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parenthood is challenging but fulfilling.

He’d double over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tests revealed that Joe had pertussis, a bacterial infection. It’s also called whooping cough because of the sound some kids make during the coughing fits that Joe experienced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The constant hacking is exhausting and sometimes life-threatening, doctors say, especially for small children and babies with tiny airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They’re unable to catch their breath,” said Dr. Sapna Singh of Texas Children’s Pediatrics near Houston. “They’re fighting for air. They’re fighting to breathe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The virulent cough is unparalleled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I had a patient this year who broke two ribs coughing,” said Dr. Molly O’Shea, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “We had an infant who coughed so hard that they ended up with a pneumothorax,” also known as a collapsed lung. “That’s essentially when your lung pokes a hole out of itself and air starts collecting outside the lung.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Why whooping cough is making a comeback&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Whooping cough has been increasing since the early 2000s, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data&lt;/a&gt;, with about 10,000 reported cases each year. The spread slowed during the pandemic lockdown, as many infectious illnesses did, but cases are rising once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Michigan, where the Moor family lives, whooping cough cases have skyrocketed.

A new study with the largest dataset of its kind has identified distinct brain activity patterns that separate lucid dreaming from both REM sleep and wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research reveals unique shifts in perception, memory, and self-awareness that occur during this rare conscious state within sleep. These findings challenge the traditional boundary between wakefulness and sleep, suggesting consciousness can emerge entirely from within the dream state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Brain Activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Lucid dreaming shows neural patterns distinct from REM sleep and wakefulness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Awareness in Sleep:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain regions linked to cognitive control and self-perception are more active.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consciousness Redefined:&lt;/strong&gt; The study supports the idea that consciousness can arise during sleep without waking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucid dreaming is a surreal phenomenon in which people are consciously aware that they are in a dream.

During initial LD eye signaling compared to baseline, source-level gamma1 power (30-36 Hz) increased in right temporo-occipital regions, including the right precuneus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, functional connectivity analysis revealed increased inter-hemispheric and inter-regional gamma1 connectivity during LD, reflecting widespread network engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that distinct source-level power and connectivity patterns characterize the dynamic neural processes underlying LD, including shifts in network communication and regional activation that may underlie the specific changes in perception, memory processing, self-awareness, and cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings illuminate the electrophysiological correlates of LD, laying the groundwork for decoding the mechanisms of this intriguing state of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:29:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1tSGZHeVVyMkhoU0k2bVVya3BOV2NudEgxSnh1d3MySUY4RmNIWXBWTHBmcmwzanI4VGpWRnZSa3h4RnFkU25nY2NONHk1R3pqRnlCdHFtZ1BWRFJDMjUwY2l2aHF5Q3hiTWZfZC1sd0hWUQ</guid></item><item><title>高科技贴纸可以识别真实的人类情感- Phys.org | High-tech sticker can identify real human emotions - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5heFlJUHVfSEp3ZnJMQVhKOUJqZ0o3VmJJN2FKX1g0M2tuWUFzZWtMTjF5YXE4VTdVNFNmbC1LNnpfQzEyQWZkd1RMVkNTaTE0LWFnY0lVNzZ3cWk2NzdMb01IN2V0LVRkUGlXVjVaYl_SAW9BVV95cUxQcXd6U3JSc2h0cVU0OGtQNlcxSHl3N0tNTVkzQ2dTUHRCcE00UGpmSUtqY3lxN3hDWjlwRDFyZWIweGJBZ3NUNmw3WkVoM0FzaVFXV2xPU3BReTRWbndnRkduMGJoQ0pOTUNnOTkzYW8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying one thing while feeling another is part of being human, but bottling up emotions can have serious psychological consequences, such as anxiety or panic attacks. To help health care providers tell the difference, a team led by scientists at Penn State has created a stretchable, rechargeable sticker that can detect real emotions—by measuring things like skin temperature and heart rate—even when users put on a brave face.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The researchers recently unveiled the wearable patch that can simultaneously and accurately track multiple emotional signals in a study &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c06392" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nano Letters&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a new and improved way to understand our emotions by looking at multiple body signals at once," said Huanyu "Larry" Cheng, the James L. Henderson, Jr. Memorial Associate Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Penn State and lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Relying only on facial expressions to understand emotions can be misleading. People often don't visibly show how they truly feel, so that's why we're combining facial expression analysis with other important physiological signals, which will ultimately lead to better mental health monitoring and support."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sticker-like patch tracks a range of physiological responses, such as skin temperature, humidity, heart rate and blood oxygen levels, that are associated with emotional states. Most importantly, Cheng explained, the device's sensors are designed to work independently, minimizing any interference between the different measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device combines its analysis of the physiological signals with facial expression data to better distinguish between genuine emotions and acted ones. It then wirelessly transmits the real-time measured data to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mobile+devices/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mobile devices&lt;/a&gt; and the cloud, where clinicians could potentially use it to better assess patients virtually. The device does not record &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/personal+information/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;personal information&lt;/a&gt;, only signals, Cheng explained, meaning personal privacy is protected through the device's design.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This technology has the potential to help people who are struggling with their mental health, but maybe aren't being fully honest with others or even themselves about how much they are struggling," said Yangbo Yuan, co-author of the paper and doctoral student at Penn State studying engineering science and mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Cheng explained that the collected data could also help bridge cultural or social gaps, which can manifest as a person appearing more stoic or expressive to their &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+care+providers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care providers&lt;/a&gt;: "By keeping track of these signals, it could be possible to detect problems like anxiety or depression earlier in its progression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers built the stretchy, Band-Aid-sized device by folding together thin layers of flexible metals like platinum and gold and cutting them into wave-like shapes that maintain sensitivity even when pulled or twisted. They also used layers of materials that change the flow of electrical current with temperature and built in hollow tubes made of carbon atoms, which absorb water and track humidity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiple sensors were designed and placed on the device in such a way that they would not interfere with each other's measurements. For example, the researchers put a rigid layer under the temperature and humidity sensors to protect them from the stretching that the facial expression sensors would experience. They also used a waterproof layer to protect the temperature and strain sensors from humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've engineered this device to measure these different signals independently, without them interfering with each other, providing a much clearer and more accurate picture of what's happening beneath the surface," said Libo Gao, co-corresponding author on the paper and associate professor at Xiamen University.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Next, the team trained an artificial intelligence (AI) model to read and understand signs of performed and real human emotions. The researchers recruited eight people, a common sample size for pilot studies, to perform six common facial expressions: happiness, surprise, fear, sadness, anger and disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="article-gallery lightGallery"&gt;

             &lt;figcaption class="text-left text-darken text-truncate text-low-up mt-3"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants displayed each emotional expression 100 times while the device tracked their movement. The researchers then fed this data to an AI model, training it to correlate specific facial movements with different emotions. They then recruited an additional three participants to further evaluate the model's abilities. It classified performed &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/facial+expressions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;facial expressions&lt;/a&gt; with 96.28% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to tracking real emotions, the researchers tested how well the device tracked the psychological responses of the same participants as they watched video clips designed to elicit emotions. The device correctly identified emotions with 88.83% accuracy, with the sensors confirming that the psychological responses were consistent with known links between emotions and psychological reactions, such as increases in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/skin+temperature/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;skin temperature&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/heart+rate/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt; during surprise and anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng noted that the ability to wirelessly transmit the data means that &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+care+professionals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care professionals&lt;/a&gt; could potentially monitor individuals remotely and provide timely emotional support through telemedicine.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"This sensor can serve a vital function in bridging gaps in access to care," he said. "Given the rising stress levels in modern society, the ability to monitor emotions can provide early indicators of debilitating conditions and allow for proactive support."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the device also opens the door for other systems for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI)-powered disease diagnostics and therapeutics beyond just emotion recognition. He noted there may be potential applications for clinicians to better understand the mental and emotional state of non-verbal patients, better identify behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia and recognize opioid overdose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology could one day even be used for chronic wound monitoring and disease management, he added, as well as track neurodegenerative disease progression and athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While still in the research and development phase, this device is a significant step forward in our ability to monitor and understand human emotions, potentially paving the way for more proactive and personalized approaches to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mental+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; care," Cheng said.&lt;/p&gt;

When her condition didn't improve, she was transferred to Children's Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City on April 13, where she was diagnosed as having encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said the girl has an underlying heart condition and had surgery for a ventricular septal defect when she was 2 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polymerase chain reaction tests on her respiratory samples were negative for H5 avian flu, but her cerebrospinal fluid sample was positive for the virus, with results confirmed by the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient remains hospitalized on a ventilator with stable vital signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epidemiologic investigation found that, before she got sick, the child had contact with a poultry flock at her grandmother's house that had experienced mass deaths 2 weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Earlier report described meningitis presentation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials said H5N1 infections that involve only the central nervous system are rare but have been reported before, such as in &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa044307"&gt;2004 in Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; when clinicians identified H5N1 in the cerebrospinal one of two siblings who died within weeks of each other from severe neurologic symptoms, but without respiratory symptoms, suggesting that the illness spectrum is wider than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vietnam reported its last human H5 case in &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/vietnam-reports-human-h5-avian-flu-case"&gt;December 2024&lt;/a&gt;, which involved an 18-year-old man from Long An province who was exposed to sick poultry and died from his infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear which H5N1 clade infected the girl, but in 2024 scientists warned of an H5N1 reassortant circulating across the Greater Mekong region that has infected both birds and people. It contains surface proteins of an older H5N1 clade (2.3.2.1c) that has circulated in parts of Asia with a newer clade (2.3.4.4b) that has circulated globally since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As such, if you're getting vitamin D from fish sources, try to opt for wild-caught fish instead of farmed-raised fish. The USDA says sockeye salmon has an average of 670 IU of vitamin D per 3.5-ounce serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Swordfish&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another fatty fish that is an excellent source of vitamin D is the swordfish. The USDA lists a 100-gram serving as having 666 IU of vitamin D. That's more than the 600 IU daily recommendation for people ages 1 to 70 years old, so cooking up some swordfish for dinner may help you easily meet your vitamin D needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tuna&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lunchtime staple can also pack a vitamin D punch. While not as high as salmon or swordfish, fresh yellowfin tuna still contains 82 IU of vitamin D per 100-gram serving, according to the USDA. It can be a food to include as part of an overall diet in vitamin D rich foods. However, bluefin tuna has 227 IU of vitamin D per 100-gram serving, so check which type of tuna you're eating as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Egg yolks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As listed by the USDA, one whole egg yolk packs a whopping 218 IU in vitamin D. Simply making a frittata or some scrambled eggs in the morning with two eggs could give you a 436-IU boost of vitamin D. That's a good way to start off any morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Orange juice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While oranges are more known for their vitamin C, orange juice often comes fortified with added vitamin D to help boost our health. Check the label on your orange juice to see if it has been fortified with vitamin D. One study found that both vitamin D2 and D3 are as equally &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2869510/" target="_self"&gt;bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; in orange juice as taking vitamin D capsules, meaning the body can still absorb the vitamins well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fortified milk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milk is another drink that is often fortified with vitamin D to help us get this valuable nutrient. Like orange juice, milk is not a natural source of vitamin D, but the FDA allows &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/vitamin-d-milk-and-milk-alternatives" target="_self"&gt;manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to voluntarily add up to 84 IU of vitamin D3 per 100 grams of milk and 84 IU per 100 grams of D2 to plant-based milk alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fortified cereal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another good way to access vitamin D is to choose cereals that have been fortified with it. There are a wide variety of cereals that all add vitamin D. You simply need to check the label of what you are buying. The &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-d/art-20363792" target="_self"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; lists fortified cereal as a good source of Vitamin D. You might look for more healthy brands of cereal, such as whole grain options, which are more likely to fortify with higher levels of Vitamin D and be better for you overall. Try to avoid highly sugary cereals with fewer nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beef liver&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver is a love-it-or-hate-it food, but if you like beef liver, it's another good way to get vitamin D. You can either cook it up, popular with onions, or liver sausage can be a good source of vitamin D. According to the USDA, pan-fried cooked beef liver has 40 IU of &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/usdandb/VitaminD-Content.pdf" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; in a single slice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sardines&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another food people either really love or really hate. However, if you're a sardine fan, sardines have a higher amount of vitamin D as well. The USDA says 100 grams of canned sardines have 193 IU of vitamin D. Enjoy sardines on some crackers or add them to your favorite pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Herring &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herring is another type of fatty fish that is popular to eat out of a jar and on crackers, or you can cook it up for dinner. Herring boasts 214 IU of vitamin D for a 100-gram serving, according to the USDA. In fact, herring is a popular food to eat around the holidays in the Midwest. During the cold and darker months, it's a convenient and popular holiday food, and it boasts fairly high vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wild Mushrooms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for vitamin D that doesn't come from an animal source, mushrooms are perfect. Just like us, mushrooms create &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-foods-high-in-vitamin-d#6.-Mushrooms" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to UV light from the sun. Fungi are packed with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213178/" target="_self"&gt;vitamin D2&lt;/a&gt; (animal sources contain vitamin D3), and one cup of wild mushrooms can equal about 136 IU of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:01:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNYVFza2tmdlAyV0ptWGVtLVc0cm5SQlZTVXFqZmVrcWdCNEpvcC1MSnA4XzZFYzR6NWVCUnJFTFBqVmp4Z2tzemtfd01kYnNKMWgwaG9SbTlLU3h1VEUzY3kwY2FmMjBnMlZ6VXNuQTJqR0dWUmE1b2N1aWpuQkZOd3NxTl9Nd0tuemVGRTBtcnpDSzY2SFE</guid></item><item><title>未接种疫苗的儿童长期感染COVID的风险高达20倍，分析发现- Medical Xpress | Unvaccinated kids face up to 20 times higher risk of long COVID, analysis finds - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPYXFWVFI5WklnUE0tZFVIRjR5bXk4Tlg1eWFRWHFxODBwU3hVeUdqamVWYm1pVTVlZkRrblpiRjNBb0RZbUtLajBSSGdPbWNJNXNfSGRRVXV6RXo1RTV3cUU0RzZkc3BYTzhNZXItVkgwXzl0Y2RDVDd3ZF83Q215QUlsRHZuVk4xS1pn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unvaccinated children and adolescents were up to 20 times more likely to develop long COVID than their vaccinated peers, according to new research led by a team from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. However, the analysis they performed also indicated that protection afforded by the vaccine primarily comes from preventing infection in the first place, rather than offering special protection against long COVID itself.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"In other words, vaccination has been key to preventing COVID-19 infection, which is important to reducing the risk of long COVID as well," said Yong Chen, Ph.D., a professor of Biostatistics and senior author of the study &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2589537024005418" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long COVID's impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the enduring mysteries of the COVID-19 pandemic is the cause of "long COVID," a collection of symptoms that can appear or persist weeks and months after a person's initial infection has subsided. While the underlying mechanisms of this syndrome remain unclear, scientists know that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/viral+infections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt; often give rise to post-viral syndromes featuring fatigue, "brain fog," and other non-specific symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections, caused by the emergent coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, are no exception: Long COVID, known more formally as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), became remarkably common during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in June 2022, after the worst phases of the pandemic had passed, a survey conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC) suggested that about 7.5% of Americans, including more than 9% of American women, were still suffering from long COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the causes of long COVID remain unclear and no common treatments are currently available, some prior studies have examined whether vaccination prior to infection offers any protection against developing long COVID. However, their findings have been inconsistent. New research now suggests that vaccines may offer greater protection against long COVID than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prior studies that simply compare vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals may not fully capture the true impact of vaccination on long COVID, as they often overlook the fact that vaccination substantially reduces the risk of infection in the first place," said co-author Jeffrey Morris, Ph.D., director of Biostatistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most research on vaccine effectiveness against long COVID has primarily focused on adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study targets children and adolescents because their immune responses to vaccines and the development of long COVID symptoms might differ significantly from those seen in adults," Morris explained.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Protection against long COVID or infection?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a research initiative known as RECOVER—which gathers and analyzes &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electronic+health+records/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electronic health records&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+systems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health systems&lt;/a&gt; nationwide to better understand long COVID—the research team conducted an observational study with de-identified electronic health records from nearly 400,000 children and adolescents across the United States. The study pulled data from the major COVID-19 waves of 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these records, the researchers constructed three separate groups or "cohorts" of vaccinated and unvaccinated young people: 112,590 adolescents (12-to-20-year-olds) whose records from July through Nov 2021—when delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 dominated—were analyzed, and 188,894 children (5-to-11-year-olds) and 84,735 adolescents from records dating to January through November 2022—when omicron was dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysis suggested that the vaccine was about 95% effective in preventing long COVID in adolescents during the delta wave of 2021—meaning vaccinated adolescents were only about 5% as likely to get long COVID compared to their unvaccinated peers. In this cohort, the researchers found 0.11 cases of long COVID in the vaccinated group per 10,000 person-weeks (a statistical measure that accounts for the number of participants and how long they participated), compared to 3.54 cases in the unvaccinated group—a 32-fold difference.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In 2022, against omicron variants, vaccination was about 60% effective in preventing long COVID in the 5-to-11-year-old group and 75% effective in the 12-to-20-year-old group. In the children's group, the long COVID incidence rates were 0.33 in vaccinated children and 1.07 among the unvaccinated (the rate tripled in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/unvaccinated+children/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;unvaccinated children&lt;/a&gt;). Among adolescents in omicron, the incidence rates were 0.24 in the vaccinated and 1.43 among the unvaccinated (almost a six-fold difference).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using mediation analysis, we were able to disentangle how much of the vaccine's protection was due to preventing initial infection versus a direct benefit on long COVID after infection," said first author Qiong Wu, Ph.D., who conducted the research as a postdoctoral fellow at Penn Medicine and is now an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mediation analysis suggested that, once infected, vaccinated children and adolescents were just as likely to develop long COVID as their unvaccinated peers. This seemed to indicate no additional, special protective effect once infection occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preventing COVID-19 infections in the first place, including through vaccination, appears to be the best way to avoid long COVID," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and the Columbia Butler Aging Center suggests that risk factors and biomarkers related to Alzheimer's disease are associated with cognition much earlier in life than previously recognized. The study highlights significant associations between cognition and Alzheimer's disease risk factors as young as ages 24 to 44 and underscores the importance of early prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This is the first study to systematically examine Alzheimer's disease risk factors, including biomarkers related to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+impairment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; in a large group of generally healthy middle-aged individuals in the U.S. The findings are published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X25000973" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lancet-Regional Health Americas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previously, research on Alzheimer's disease risk factors has focused on individuals aged 50 and older," said Allison Aiello, Ph.D., James S. Jackson Healthy Longevity Professor of Epidemiology in the Butler Aging Center and Columbia Mailman School. "The potential impact of our findings is substantial, offering clinicians and health researchers a clearer understanding of the early emergence of Alzheimer's disease risk factors and their association with cognition before middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Aiello, the results reveal that several well-established risk factors and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+biomarkers/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; are linked to cognitive function even before midlife. These earlier life associations provide a baseline for predicting long-term trajectories of cognitive decline. "Additionally, we learned that certain Alzheimer's risk factors—such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, ATN (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration), and immune biomarkers—are present and related to cognition in individuals in their forties and even earlier."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Aiello and colleagues used the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia (CAIDE) score, which covers factors like age, education, sex, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systolic+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, body mass index, cholesterol, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt;, and the gene variant apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE ε4) which is a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+risk+factor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were analyzed from Waves IV and V of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which tracked a nationally representative cohort of adolescents since 1994–1995 through multiple follow-up waves. About half of the participants in Wave IV were female (48.4–52.1%), and just over 70% (71.4–72.5%) were white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, Wave IV consisted of data from up to 11,449 individuals aged 24–34. The researchers conducted in-home interviews, cognitive tests, physical exams, and gathered blood samples from 4,507 participants. In Wave V, both in-person and web/mail surveys were directed to participants aged 34–44.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total of 1,112 participants who received in-home interviews were given cognitive tasks such as immediate word recall, delayed word recall, and backward digit span and provided a sample for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+testing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic testing&lt;/a&gt;. Scores on the cognitive tasks were linked to the overall CAIDE score in 529 individuals at Wave V.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Exploring the relationship between the CAIDE score and cognitive function in young adulthood and early midlife in the U.S., showed that significant associations with cardiovascular risk factors can be observed well before age 50," Aiello explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, biologically—genetic, neurological, immune, and inflammatory biomarkers have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease risk. The amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) biomarkers—collectively known as ATN—are increasingly viewed as promising indicators for predicting Alzheimer's disease risk in older populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATN biomarker and several immune markers showed associations with cognitive function before midlife. However, a key genetic risk factor, APOE, did not appear to affect participants in these middle years and may not become evident until later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our overall findings suggest that blood-based biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease are linked to differences in cognitive function decades before clinical symptoms and impairments even appear, highlighting the importance of early prevention strategies across the life course," Aiello noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Identifying the early pathways to Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment before older age is critical to slowing the expected rise of Alzheimer's disease in the coming decades."&lt;/p&gt;

My response was appropriate; I vomited. I was the first person among my peers to get a cancer diagnosis. No one knew what to say or do for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LZGROKBSSJC4JBAPC2CL3KEQHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s why news headlines like “&lt;a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-younger-adults-what-to-know-about-screening-and-your-risk/2024/04" target="_blank"&gt;Cancer Is on the Rise in Younger Adults&lt;/a&gt;” hit me hard. Worldwide, the incidence of early-onset cancers (those 18-49) has surged  almost 80 percent between 1990 and 2019; deaths from these cancers increased  almost 30 percent over that same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AARAPM73DVFY7OTWIVG7PCNTRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I am now a 40-year survivor, something I didn’t think I’d live to see. While I’m glad researchers are working hard to understand why this rise in cases is occurring, I’ve found that telling my story to other young people can make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JHFT456XFJC5PHQ2HOU47PIUDQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It comes up in the strangest of places, at a college reunion or a friend’s birthday, and when I volunteer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I can put it no other way than to say I’m transformed into a gift called hope. (Or my story is.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BUPY63CCOJGQHE3AAG5L67RJYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s what happened after the oncologist told me I had testicular cancer: Over eight months, I had two surgeries and 16 administrations of a powerful chemotherapy “cocktail.” I lost the beard on my face and the hair on my head, chest and pubic region. I shed 15 percent of my body weight and experienced mouth sores, neuropathy, nausea, constipation and hearing loss. I was left with two scars, a three-incher in my pubic area and the other, a 12-incher that runs from below my belly button up to my breastbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4LLBIIAUWFG5XIDWP3DKCUYJLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My cancer — which I named “Max” so that I could curse him out by name — affected every aspect of my life, from career and money to sex and intimacy, upending my mental health and my relationships. In the vernacular of young people today, it was “a lot.” I would have called it “too much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJGQDFTLCNHXJGGJZI2KQHTNYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I know all too well the fear and isolation many young people with cancer experience. Cancer is always a lonely proposition, but it’s especially so for young adults. The loneliness I experienced was pervasive. Older people, mostly my parents’ friends, didn’t understand, and my contemporaries often struggled because I had the dubious distinction to be their first friend facing a life-threatening illness. One grad school colleague told me years later, “I just didn’t know how to be your friend once you were diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S3DGBBQACFCODMWT3KH6MJ2GDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Back then, I joined a support group, where almost all my “peers” were married, had kids (even grandkids) or were retired. “Issues for someone age 25 may be very different from someone 35 or 45,” as well as those who are even older, Nancy Borstelmann, the co-director of Yale’s &lt;a href="https://www.yalecancercenter.org/patient/specialty/early-onset-cancer-program/#:~:text=The%20Early%20Onset%20Cancer%20Program,onset%20cancer%20and%20their%20families." target="_blank"&gt;Early-Onset Cancer Program&lt;/a&gt;, told me recently. But if there’s one thing we all have in common, she said, it’s the “fear about dying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KJO4IXO4YJGFZPUVOASDNGFKYI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To be fair, I didn’t always know what to say or do, either. I snapped at those who mindlessly asked how I was doing or even in some cases if I was going to die. My peer group just didn’t know better or have much experience with really sick people. One afternoon I got into a heated argument with a nurse who was suggesting a men’s “Small” for the prosthesis I needed. Like any other dude in his twenties, I insisted I was a “Large.” (There were no “Mediums” available.) I responded as though this was a life and death decision. Obviously not, but I did feel as though my “manhood” was on the line. This was new territory, and we all had lessons to learn, including me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMS5XJOX6NADRP4NKZZL7AYABM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I tried hard to wait to worry (or at least not to freak out) while awaiting pathology reports, X-rays, ultrasounds and CT scans. So much uncertainty. A nurse suggested &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/biofeedback/about/pac-20384664#:~:text=Biofeedback%20is%20a%20type%20of,get%20information%20about%20your%20body." target="_blank"&gt;biofeedback&lt;/a&gt; to me, which she explained could lessen my dependence on antianxiety drugs. I tried it and it helped. She also explained that the worst possible outcome is not the most common one. I struggled with that suggestion when she said it but time has proved her right; I remain healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CCLT7ZRXGNCA3MPVPIPNDEWUGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There were other challenges. Postsurgery I could no longer do everything for myself as I once had. That included bending over to tie my shoes or going food shopping. I needed help for the first time in my life; it took me a while to learn how to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KYDHMWDSRRGYBKGSGR7BCWWDSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I didn’t know how to talk about my fears. While hospitalized for two weeks I relied on a well-honed sarcasm, which pushed people away, or my ever-growing list of grievances, like the poly/cotton sheets on my bed, the robes that never cover your butt, and the size of that silicone prosthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XYKE2ULHIJEALBA6LEH7LM34JA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I railed at the loss of control as I tried — in vain — to reassert it. When my hair began to fall out, I cut it off preemptively. Fearing that my boyfriend would leave me, I broke up with him first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2PHU23XSNNBHJATKLK3WXPJALI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And I blamed myself. “What did I do to deserve this?” I asked repeatedly. I had yet to learn the lesson that bad things happen to good people, or really, that any illusion of control is just that. Cancer pierced any notion that life is fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VA6CGIVOYVCOFKCBFCHSCOOVL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I also discovered that the psychological side effects of my disease could rival the physical ones. My second, more complicated surgery had a frequent side effect of affecting fertility. At 26, I’d hardly given any thought to raising a family, when a hospital social worker asked me, “Would you like a referral to a sperm bank?” (Yes, I would.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHCGF3YR6RDFFIGQOQFAQYY4SA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A few years after my diagnosis, and when all my treatments were done, I left grad school in a fog of uncertainty. I wrote in my journal back then: “If I have a shorter life, I don’t want to spend the next five years in this program.” I didn’t think about saving for retirement, buying a house, or doing any of the “adult” things my friends were now doing. Instead I bought a lot of nice sweaters, putting them on multiple credit cards. Why pay today, when tomorrow might not come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IJQ7UOC5JNBLJNSZIM46HKRYJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I’d be misleading you if I left the impression that all was dark. I found a new career as a writer. I met a new boyfriend. My hair grew back! I also chose to face some weighty questions: How do I live a life that matters? How do I want to spend my time? What gives me joy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HSHU4XJUGZHONC2FNVRTTFE7JU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That’s the ironic thing about having cancer as a young adult: You confront the idea of death too soon, but if all goes well you have a lot of years afterward. You struggle to believe it’s behind you, while still dreading its return. But time does heal some wounds. It also gave me much-needed perspective, even a sense of humor. When I lost a job, separated from my husband and even when a huge branch of a pecan tree almost  crushed my house, I was able to say to myself, “At least, it’s not cancer!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:00:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPSFB5QWNNUHB5djZIQkR2cUpQbzRENUJBS2FPaWUxeXhSYWxIWElYRTJIY3h3M0pRbDhyb2FwaEQyTXk5SW9rU0pUc2E1RXlCQnFBNWtSVFJjeks0UTN6OTA4bTVzam1VQkxKM1pZM3pySkZGZXZQcExNQTZuaS05UlJOYmk3ajJvRFhTUQ</guid></item><item><title>如何快速安全地减掉多达5磅的水分- womansworld.com | How To Lose up to 5 Lbs of Water Weight Quickly + Safely - womansworld.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE13YXdTbHN2RVJwMFgyVTFfUmlNZVp0MllrVk1xVWRma1EzbjFWbVBvcHFsaF81d2xsb2NKOTdGY01VeEFzS2tTaTVIaTZpNnU3MWRTbkoySUlDRUlZQjhXZFVaUGliREJOLWtWUTFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body class="post-template-default single single-post postid-221442 single-format-standard post-lose-the-water-weight theme-womans-world has-custom-search article-format-posts" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Last week, he promised to find some of the causes of rising U.S. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-autism-cases-health-secretary-ca210c5c37e12d6377a1af16ae4f4fbc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autism rates;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;autism rates&lt;/a&gt; in under six months’ time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy's followers — a contingent of health-conscious moms, Republicans loyal to President Donald Trump and others — have celebrated his “Make America Healthy Again” initiatives. But scientists and public health experts have expressed dismay over some of Kennedy's statements about Americans' diets, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-rfk-death-vaccine-4e28b0edf5cab47980b40b2d47f0ec50" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vaccines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-messaging-criticism-vaccine-1a2cbdc14eb0c256695fdfac00cbfb6d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-rates-us-rfk-diagnosis-cdc-cb3abd799edd591dc1ea6b63c69a2279" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:autism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a look at some of those claims Kennedy has made, with additional context and facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, at a news conference Wednesday: Studies show that autism rates in the U.S. were “1 in 10,000 when I was a kid” compared to a recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that found it to be 1 in 31. He says that is evidence of an autism epidemic in the U.S. and that, “we know it's an environmental exposure. It has to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: It’s true that in the 20th century, only 1 in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism —- the diagnosis was rare and given only to kids with severe problems communicating or socializing and those with unusual, repetitive behaviors. But the term became shorthand for a group of milder, related conditions known as ″autism spectrum disorders,” and the number of kids labeled as having some form of autism began to balloon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The term “epidemic” is widely used to describe surges in different health problems — like autism, obesity and gun violence, to name a few. But strictly speaking, “epidemic” is defined as a fast-spreading outbreak of disease, and there's not good evidence that autism meets that definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Health officials have largely attributed growing autism numbers to better recognition of cases, through wide screening and better diagnosis. Last week, the CDC said &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autism-rates-us-rfk-diagnosis-cdc-cb3abd799edd591dc1ea6b63c69a2279" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diagnosis rate is up to 1 in 31 children;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;diagnosis rate is up to 1 in 31 children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are no blood or biologic tests for autism; it is diagnosed by making judgments about a child’s behavior. Research has looked at a variety of other possible explanations, including genetics, the age of the father, the weight of the mother and chemicals in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Prior to his rise to health secretary, Kennedy joined anti-vaccine advocates in claiming childhood vaccines are responsible for autism, but studies by the CDC and others have ruled that out. A fraudulent single study that claimed a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was later retracted by the journal that published it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy recently announced a major study into the cause of autism and told an April 10 Cabinet meeting: “By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.” But last week, he softened that to having ”some of the answers by September."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Mike Stobbe and Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vaccines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in interview with Sean Hannity that aired on Fox News on March 11: “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes — it causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera. And so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: The measles vaccine is safe and its risks are lower than the risks of complications from measles. There have been no documented deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/public-health/measles/know-the-facts/#:~:text=Fact%3A%20Getting%20the%20vaccine%20is,don't%20get%20the%20vaccine." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Infectious Diseases Society of America;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Infectious Diseases Society of America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most people who get the MMR vaccine have no serious problems from it, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;. The most common side effects are mild: a sore arm, fever, mild rash and temporary joint pain or stiffness in teenage or adult women who don’t already have rubella immunity. There is a very small risk of febrile seizures that increases as infants get older, which is why the shot is recommended as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people can have allergic reactions; people allergic to the antibiotic neomycin should not get the shot, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in an April interview with CBS: “We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the (MMR) vaccine wanes very quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: The measles vaccine is highly protective and lasts a lifetime for most people. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide.&lt;/a&gt; Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-mmr-outbreak-vaccines-408371700e3ab548777bf0354e586549" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:3 million to 4 million cases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;3 million to 4 million cases&lt;/a&gt; per year. Now, it’s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Usually, most measles cases come to the U.S. from abroad. This is why high vaccination rates are important. When 95% or more people are vaccinated, entire communities are considered protected from the virus, which is important for people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;— Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, in a CBS interview posted April 9, discussing death of 8-year-old child in Texas who had measles: “The thing that killed (her) was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Two children in Texas have died — both from measles complications, according to the Texas State Department of Health and Human Services. The state health department has made clear that the children were not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Doctors at University Medical Center in Lubbock who treated the 8-year-old said she died of “measles pulmonary failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Claiming that patients die of complications and not the actual disease that led to them is a tactic that anti-vaccine advocates have used to undermine Texas health experts since the first child died of measles in March — and in other outbreaks before that. It's also a talking point that Kennedy, who spent &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-vaccines-trump-rfkjr-7f8dcb25de76a5a70710d22bbc63f6fa" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:20 years;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;20 years&lt;/a&gt; as one of the world's leading anti-vaccine activists, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:continues to amplify;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;continues to amplify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles complications can include pneumonia, brain swelling and other respiratory or neurological complications, which can lead to death in 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—-Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1909049021211263268" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:KENNEDY, in April 6 in an X post,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;KENNEDY, in April 6 in an X post,&lt;/a&gt; said two &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-ben-edwards-2dd7c79d47c64ad2e6d4a4ac3c87ec1f" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Texas doctors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Texas doctors&lt;/a&gt; "have treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Pediatricians note there is no cure for measles: It is a virus that the body has to fight off on its own. The best way to protect against the risks of measles is to get vaccinated to lower the chance of contracting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Budesonide is a steroid used in different forms to treat asthma, ulcerative colitis and other conditions. Clarithromycin is an antibiotic; it fights bacteria, not viruses. Neither drug is recommended for treating measles — the use is “risky and unproven” — &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOopVJ39D8WDjcJEmWlUZYL1J9rLVJURjgaldZptndNq-UQVOGGZ2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the American Academy of Pediatrics says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There are no miracle cures for measles,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, who chairs the academy's Committee on Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOorT8Sr9yjNVQdr2q9VZwpm0YYljuJGUDnKV-BWaft656gAsiHDC" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recently said in a fact check on the organization's website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recently said in a fact check on the organization's website&lt;/a&gt;. "If your child becomes sick with measles, doctors will do everything we can to care for them, but the truth is we do not have effective treatments against this viral infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—-Devi Shastri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nutrition and obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY, at an April 15 event in Indianapolis, said 70% of Americans are obese or overweight, compared to 3% of Americans during President John F. Kennedy's tenure in the early 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Nearly three-quarters of Americans are overweight, including about 40% with obesity, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recent figures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;recent figures&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. Between 1960 and 1962, about 13% of people in the U.S. had obesity, according to historic CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rise in obesity in the U.S. and other developed countries in recent decades has been well-documented and studied. Experts say there is no single explanation for the increase, but that it stems from a combination of factors, including biological and environmental contributors, an increase in available calories and a decline in physical activity. Changes in the food supply, including the development of high-calorie, cheap ultraprocessed foods have been linked to obesity, but &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-nih-kevin-hall-kennedy-b40b626771519f3f9a6546699491fc3b" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exactly how these foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;exactly how these foods&lt;/a&gt; affect weight gain remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY at April 10 cabinet meeting regarding food dyes: “We’ve shown now that this directly affects academic performance, violence in the schools, and mental health, as well as physical health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: &lt;a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/risk-assessment/report/health-effects-assessment-potential-neurobehavioral-effects-synthetic-food-dyes-children" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Recent research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows synthetic food colors common in U.S. foods are linked to neurobehavioral problems in children and that the dyes may cause or exacerbate symptoms, particularly hyperactivity. In addition, children may vary widely in their sensitivity to the dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is clear that some children are likely to be more adversely affected by food dyes than others," researchers in California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment reported in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Those responses have the potential to affect school work and behaviors such as aggression, but to date there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship between food dyes and academic performance, violence or other mental and physical conditions, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To date, scientific evidence shows that “most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives,” according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the dyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;KENNEDY on March 28 during a speech in West Virginia to encourage restrictions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: “Twenty years ago, there was no diabetes in China. Today 50% of the population is diabetic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;THE FACTS: Diabetes prevalence has gone up in China over the past two decades, driven by rising living standards, urbanization and an aging population.

Because intermittent fasting doesn’t typically require monitoring calories or changing what you eat, it can feel easier to stick with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GZXZ7ROZORBK3DA3X4367CW6EA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Interest in the practice took off in the last decade or so, after experiments in animals showed that eating restricted to certain times had a profound impact on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30174302/" target="_blank"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25470548/" target="_blank"&gt;the microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. But in people, the weight-loss benefits linked to intermittent fasting may be because they took in less food in general — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9407646/" target="_blank"&gt;up to 550 fewer calories per day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2WHWIR5RJJB5BFUZVDUQBUNXVU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both intermittent fasting and overall calorie restriction approaches can result in weight loss for a few months, but they are very hard to sustain; studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11192144/" target="_blank"&gt;some of that weight comes back&lt;/a&gt; after a year, regardless of the approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YL2XKAVZPFBRHNY6IPYRP7TXMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Given all these factors, intermittent fasting is not my go-to recommendation for healthy eating.

That means the control group was likely consuming more calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h5 class="wpds-c-vXjlY wpds-c-vXjlY-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="KRZQ337LSNHHNGS77XNA5TP3ZM" data-apitype="header" level="5" id="KRZQ337LSNHHNGS77XNA5TP3ZM"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time-restricted eating&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3YR5WNCRGRBBVG54P7CGTU3P2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This approach involves fasting for a part of the day — say, 16 hours of a 24-hour cycle — and then eating only within the remaining window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JNTFMTEOSNBW3ICD4P7C4YXZSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11192144/" target="_blank"&gt;large study from last year&lt;/a&gt; found that time-restricted eating was just as effective as calorie-restricted diets for weight loss — about 10-12 pounds in both groups after 12 months. This study was notable because it included participants from a diverse American population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FT2WWVUK7JFEBDGG2MKONN3MKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there are also potential risks: A widely publicized 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/18/intermittent-fasting-time-restricted-eating/" target="_blank"&gt;abstract&lt;/a&gt; presented at an American Heart Association meeting indicated that an eight-hour time-restricted eating pattern was linked to a 91 percent higher risk of &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/8-hour-time-restricted-eating-linked-to-a-91-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-death" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;over a median of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QEKYV5UUAVGEBL5VBCDUSBNFJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most scientists would agree that this study raises questions but is not conclusive.

These studies can’t fully exclude the possibility that people who skip breakfast engage in other less healthy activities. But other benefits of eating breakfast, such as improved work performance and &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-nutr-082018-124320" target="_blank"&gt;an optimized circadian rhythm in the gut&lt;/a&gt;, are worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WI32VWVO4BADBNPG75T6H73ZLE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So my advice to intermittent-fasters — and everyone else — would be to eat a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/09/23/healthy-breakfast-ideas-feel-full/" target="_blank"&gt;healthy breakfast&lt;/a&gt; every day and avoid late-night meals. The evidence shows that late-night snacking and eating &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(22)00397-7" target="_blank"&gt;impacts how we burn calories and store fat&lt;/a&gt;, putting us at greater risk of obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="5Y7TRIWQKRHMLLRKI2H4YEUI64" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="5Y7TRIWQKRHMLLRKI2H4YEUI64"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are there downsides to intermittent fasting?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P5P2FDDQO5AM3AT4KFSFHE6UAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many of my patients who try intermittent fasting suffer from hanger — much like with any diet — and can also experience headaches or fatigue, at least in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TAMMUZCFZNFBBBP2H5UD4TUCNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s also important to consider how this approach can impact your social life. Meals are often what brings us together, and intermittent fasting can affect that. The risks and benefits are worth considering carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="NY36GKNXKZBPTNLTBWGJXFDFHA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="NY36GKNXKZBPTNLTBWGJXFDFHA"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I want my patients to know&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="42VKRDSXXNFQFPXOJ47CYG7PZU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Intermittent fasting has become popular as a lifestyle choice even among non-dieters: Limited studies in people have found that, for instance, intermittent fasting can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5990470/" target="_blank"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity and blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; regardless of weight changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VF562JQC5JGDPMAB7R3G5JNW54" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But you should always run any big changes in your diet by your physician.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ryan Yuen, study author and senior scientist in the Genetics &amp;amp; Genome Biology program at the Hospital for Sick Children in Las Vegas, said: 'Our findings represent a new way to characterize the genetic development of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'By identifying the molecular pathway behind this connection, we can begin to investigate new approaches to ASD diagnosis and the development of precision therapies that release these proteins back into the genome.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means essential proteins sapped away from DNA could be added back, repairing faulty genes and preventing further errors from appearing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.5776?guestAccessKey=c0957767-f5eb-4d6d-88a4-15c747418b57&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=042125"&gt;another new study&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in China found a non-invasive brain stimulation treatment may improve certain autism signs like trouble sleeping and issues with social interaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment, called transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS) involves sending electrical impulses through electrodes that are placed on a patient's scalp. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The signals coming through the electrodes are thought to increase brain activity in certain areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children ages three to 14 who received 20 tPCS sessions over four weeks had 'significant' improvements in sleep, language, sensory issues and socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both studies come as the latest CDC data shows autism is on the rise in the US, affecting one in 31 children. This is a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14619253/america-autism-hotspots-data-rampant-epidemic.html"&gt;staggering increase&lt;/a&gt; from one in 150 in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While many experts believe the rise is due to better screening and diagnostics, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14625349/autism-expert-likely-causes-america-surge-rfk-jr-toxin-cases.html"&gt;health authorities like Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; believe environmental factors like pesticides, food additives and ultrasound scans could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UNLV study, published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01943-0"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, researchers analyzed RNA in 38 gene sets from people with and without autism. RNA is a key molecule that helps cells build proteins and function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that when the DMPK gene responsible for DM1 repeats, it creates 'toxic RNA' that binds to proteins involved in DNA production during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That 'toxic RNA' depletes the protein and prevents it from binding the other RNA molecules, causing a protein imbalance and errors in other surrounding genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Yuen said: 'TREs are like a sponge that absorbs all these important proteins from the genome. Without this protein, other areas of the genome don’t function properly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted both DM1, the muscle-weakening condition, and autism can both be caused by repetitions in the DMPK gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lukasz Sznajder, a research lead and assistant professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV), said: 'A variation really stood out to me that we see in rare neuromuscular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is how we started connecting the dots. We found a molecular link, or overlap, which we believe is the core of causing autistic symptoms in children with myotonic dystrophy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DM1 leads to muscle weakness around the limbs and, as it progresses, vital organs like the heart and lungs. This leads to abnormal heart rhythms and breathing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms typically appear in adolescence or young adulthood and start with weakness around the muscles in the face, neck, fingers and ankles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition affects 140,000 Americans and the life expectancy is around 48 to 55 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study authors said more research is needed connecting DM1 to autism, but the group is planning to look at if these DNA errors are occurring in other genes that have been associated with autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also received FDA approval for a similar stem cell therapy to enter clinical trials for &lt;a href="https://alsnewstoday.com/what-is-als/"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (ALS), another neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These regulatory steps “[pave] the way for these therapies to advance into clinical trials in the United States and [lay] the foundation for future commercialization in the global market,” Xellsmart’s CEO and founder Xiang Li, PhD, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/xellsmarts-allogeneic-ipsc-derived-cell-therapies-for-parkinsons-disease-and-als-officially-approved-by-the-us-fda-for-phase-i-clinical-trials-302427583.html"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ongoing clinical trial of XS-411 in Parkinson’s patients in China, where Xellsmart is based, has so far reported a reduction of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and no adverse events related to the treatment, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Parkinson’s disease, the loss of nerve cells that produce dopamine, a chemical transmitter essential for motor function, leads to tremors, slowed movement, and a range of both &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. XS-411 is designed to replace these damaged cells, potentially alleviating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;What is XS-411 and how does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The therapy utilizes induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a versatile type of cell that can be developed into nearly any other cell type in the lab. Researchers can differentiate iPSCs into dopaminergic neurons, which are then injected into the brain. If successfully integrated, these new dopamine-producing neurons may help restore some of the function lost as the disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XS-411 uses allogeneic iPSCs derived from third-party donors, rather than from the patients themselves. This approach &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9906386/"&gt;allows for the mass production of stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and the development of an “off-the-shelf” product that can be readily available for multiple patients. While autologous iPSCs, that is, those derived from the patient, can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923025001091#sec0005"&gt;help minimize the risk of immune rejection&lt;/a&gt;, allogeneic iPSCs offer the advantage of scalability and the potential for more accessible, standardized treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XS-411 has shown initial safety and efficacy in a clinical trial in China, according to Xellsmart. In the study, cells were injected into the striatal putamen, a brain area affected by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, in patients with moderate or moderate to severe Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In six to 12 months of follow-up, the participants haven’t reported complications related to the therapy, according to the company. All those treated showed significant improvements in key measures, such as increased on time, which is when symptoms are adequately controlled, and reduced motor and nonmotor symptoms, as reflected by lower scores in the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company believes the results support XS-411’s further development. “XellSmart remains firmly committed to providing allogeneic, off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived regenerative cell therapies to patients with [central nervous system] diseases worldwide,” Li said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work by students Emmie Casey and Tomi Kuye, supported by Rice’s &lt;a href="https://oedk.rice.edu/#gsc.tab=0"&gt;Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; (OEDK), builds on a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/physiology/articles/10.3389/fphys.2021.624317/full"&gt;small Stanford University study&lt;/a&gt; that found coordinated, vibratory stimuli delivered daily to the fingertips improved patients’ motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to take this breakthrough and make it accessible to people who would never be able to afford an expensive medical device,” Casey said in a &lt;a href="https://news.rice.edu/news/2025/rice-students-develop-low-cost-vibrotactile-glove-help-treat-parkinsons-disease"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;. “We set out to design a glove that delivers the same therapeutic vibrations but at a fraction of the cost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the loss of neurons in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical that is essential for nerve cell communication and motor control. When dopamine levels drop, patients may experience tremors, stiffness, slowed movements, and problems with balance and walking. These &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/"&gt;Parkinson’s symptoms&lt;/a&gt; are partly due to abnormal, overly synchronized firing patterns in motor-related brain circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier work at Stanford University found that wearing a glove that vibrates between 100 and 300 times per second, for about two hours twice a day, can help break up that synchronization and ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;‘Not just masking symptoms’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casey and Kuye worked up a lower-cost prototype, and they said the first reactions have been positive. One early version, made for a friend’s mother who has early-onset Parkinson’s, showed some surprising results. “After about six months of wearing the gloves regularly, she was able to walk unaided,” Casey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their prototype uses the vibration motors found in wearables and smartphones, instead of the expensive ones used in other designs. Each fingertip of a soft, wireless glove has its own vibration motor, all powered by a custom circuit board placed on the wrist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This glove is designed to stimulate the Pacinian corpuscles within the fingertips to help resynchronize the neurons within the brain that cause tremors and stiffness,” Kuye said. A Pacinian corpuscle is a nerve ending that can sense pressure and vibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not just masking symptoms. We’re aiming to actually retrain this part of the brain,” said Kuye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the students are “not claiming it’s a cure,” Kuye said, “if it can give people just a little more control, a little more freedom, that’s life changing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casey and Kuye are developing a commercial version of the glove that will sell for about $250, and have started a nonprofit to use sliding-scale pricing based on what patients can afford. They’re &lt;a href="https://kinnections.foundation"&gt;taking preorders&lt;/a&gt; and accepting donations to help get the first 500 pairs out by this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students also shared &lt;a href="https://oedk.wildapricot.org/Treatment-Glove"&gt;free instructions online&lt;/a&gt; so anyone can build their own gloves. While soldering, 3D printing, and light sewing are recommended, the instructions note that the soldering joints are simple, the 3D printed parts can be ordered, and a stapler or fashion tape can be used instead of sewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Casey and Kuye are working on getting approval to test usability — that is, how well the gloves fit for use — and they’re planning to team up with people at the Texas Medical Center in Houston to test how effective the gloves are with patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This project exemplifies what we strive for at the OEDK — empowering students to translate cutting-edge research into real-world solutions,” said Maria Oden, PhD, a professor of bioengineering and director of the OEDK, who supervised the work along with Heather Bisesti, an engineering design professor at Rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oden, who is also co-director of the &lt;a href="https://rice360.rice.edu"&gt;Rice 360 Institute for Global Health Technologies&lt;/a&gt;, said the students “have shown extraordinary initiative and empathy in developing a device that could bring meaningful relief to people living with Parkinson’s, no matter their resources.”&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, it helps lower cholesterol levels, which contributes to general cardiovascular well-being, which is another way in which it improves heart health. Because of this, it is not only a supplement for weight loss, but it is also a product that promotes general health improvement.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipozem: Step-by-Step Working!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an effort to facilitate healthy and efficient weight loss, the formula is intended to preserve the body's ketosis in a state&lt;/strong&gt;. Rather than carbohydrates and calories, this condition allows the body to rely on adipose cells as an energy source. With the goal to simplify this function and provide the body with an adequate amount of energy, &lt;strong&gt;the formula is comprised of natural forms of natural BHB molecules&lt;/strong&gt;. It improves digestion, alleviates inflammation, and resets metabolic function. A new wave of interest in plant-based, science-based solutions has been ignited by this early morning habit. It lowering appetite, enhancing physical performance rates, clearing brain fog, supplying energy, and so lowering inflammation and oxidative stress damage, &lt;strong&gt;the Lipozem formula also helps the users to burn that additional fat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wyoQG-ly14Qd5Owbk2YfVIqK2iORivBhBW_1ikFE7yXNIWjkT-241oQZIuDtCs-4YcLc8pyl-V12njj7_V8rd3CiRwx-ElRthF2Jdp_1ZK9nrs9tuFHtOHScghYOM2DLQbEh8XVGTzptKbflGDlCt7HlmYi-1dkvGEfg4rxZyuGnG6NlRu7fCjIUl9DXunkP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTHING TO LOSE: “LIPOZEM” OFFERS 60-DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power-Packed Ingredients of LIPOZEM!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the natural components that are included in the &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; recipe is essential since these components are the ones that are accountable for the effective burning of fat in individuals who use the product. &lt;strong&gt;As a result of Lipozem's ability to enhance digestion, promote fat burning, and speed up metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, it is able to accomplish a synergistic impact. In the following list, you will discover a potent component!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul type="disc"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Beta Hydroxybutyrate, &lt;/strong&gt;during the process of the body transitioning into a low-carb state, a molecule known as magnesium BHB is created. &lt;strong&gt;By modulating hormones, this provides the body with the ability to burn fat cells for fuel rather than carbohydrates, which in turn helps to lower appetite&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=-xjBRSoD-CfuRh7h12aEqq4WdCrOj2ZEpmrpaHrnA3oRscjYyJU7Z7S5hr26FW-D_2Qk0vPlqGaXSd59E72XxBJ53pqaN7uo0cs5eex5dXyPsUypFLBRarsVtANtZWBbFTAZ8OKJcZf1dfzUXAlSP-rpuDG8U15YY5XQTlQaZxVNF0DyyldJzAI4vida3CAZ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium Beta Hydroxybutyrate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;Due to the fact that it helps stabilize blood sugar levels and boosts energy levels, sodium BHB is vital for individuals who suffer energy troughs or who have issues with the management of blood sugar. The glucose level in the blood can also be brought back to normal, which is another advantage. With the support of this addition, the body is able to maintain high levels of energy throughout the course of the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium Beta-Hydroxybutyrate, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2vD3P6JjnWYgXuoeXXOv_JNKcl8C8sBppH_OGUjnyxqxIXDoqq7fKrq_RJkvz-kXH8Z_0XpfoADPCBF5NGNG2VfJE-gKs6v1zfPrrCK0ksAj-R9EztIMdwM5AbfgrfGo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Calcium BHB"&gt;Calcium BHB&lt;/a&gt; is an element that helps the body transition into a low-carb state more smoothly and decreases the negative impacts of this transition. In addition to promoting improved cognitive capabilities, it helps reduce inflammation and the damage caused by oxidative stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lipozem Benefits That Make a Difference between Other Products!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A great number of advantages are made available to you as a result of the fact that it is an entirely pure product, with each and every component being pure.

It is designed to help people lose weight in an effective and long-lasting manner. One of the primary goals of the dietary supplement &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem is to assist individuals in increasing their fat burning and weight loss&lt;/strong&gt;. In most cases, it is composed of a wide range of naturally occurring components, including calcium and salt, in addition to a number of additional compounds that either stimulate thermogenesis or speed up the metabolic reactions. &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; is commonly sold as a quick treatment for persons who have sluggish metabolisms or stubborn body fat.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The manufacturer may have somewhat varying formulations, but the product is frequently touted as a rapid fix. One more research stated that In addition to providing a little boost in energy and assisting in the decrease of cravings, this combination of natural appetite suppressants and fat burners may also be able to sustain a calorie deficit that ultimately leads to weight loss. The use of &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; may be beneficial for those who struggle with fat that is either trapped or plateauing, particularly in the waist region.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrapping It Up: Is Lipozem Worth for You?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a lot of potential for Lipozem as a weight loss tablet because it has a lot of benefits that go beyond just burning fat&lt;/strong&gt;. Through the use of its natural components, it improves digestion, increases energy levels, suppresses hunger, and controls metabolism. It is a perfect complement to health since it benefits the cardiovascular system much more than it already does. It has been determined that the formula provides support for the cognitive talents and functions of the user.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anyone who is looking for a chemical that is completely natural and safe to use in order to assist with weight control will find that &lt;strong&gt;Lipozem&lt;/strong&gt; offers a comprehensive solution.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the body of a patient, a small clump of cells, growing undetected, has begun to form a tumor. It has yet to cause pain or visible symptoms of illness. Several months from now, or perhaps years, those first signs will prompt a doctor's inquiry, a referral to a specialist, and an eventual diagnosis. Treatment will depend on how long the cancer has gone unnoticed and how far it has spread.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;There were early signs, though not ones the patient or doctor could have noticed. Small fragments of RNA, cast off from dying cells or spit out of the tumor's twisted transcriptions, floating about in the bloodstream—early signals of a tissue in distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new method developed by Stanford researchers aims to bring the moment of detection much closer to the beginning. They have developed a blood-based method called RARE-seq that detects tumor-derived cell-free RNA with around 50 times the sensitivity of standard sequencing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RARE-seq showed an ability to identify lung cancer signatures in patients at various disease stages, outperforming commonly used DNA-based approaches. RNA from vaccines and many transcripts associated with non-cancer-related conditions were also detectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood-based liquid biopsies offer a non-invasive approach to capture cancer-related changes by identifying circulating tumor DNA. This allows early detection, genotyping, and monitoring of disease, even when specific tumor locations are unknown or would require surgical biopsy to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell-free RNA, fragments of RNA released into the bloodstream by dying or active cells, presents a broader diagnostic view of gene activity throughout the body. Detection requires precision because most RNA circulating in the bloodstream originates from blood-forming cells rather than tumors. Rare tumor-derived RNA molecules are often masked by the background signal of these hematopoietic transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;In the study, "An ultrasensitive method for detection of cell-free RNA," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08834-1" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed RARE-seq (random priming and affinity capture of cell-free RNA fragments for enrichment analysis by sequencing), a method optimized for the detection of cell-free RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples analyzed in the study included 437 plasma collections from 369 individuals. Participants represented a range of cancer stages, non-malignant conditions, and healthy controls drawn from multiple clinical centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers optimized the full experimental workflow for analyzing cell-free RNA in plasma. Pre-analytical variables such as blood collection, RNA extraction, and sample storage were systematically evaluated to reduce variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps in library preparation were adapted for low RNA input, including enzymatic removal of contaminating DNA, improved complementary DNA synthesis, and end-repair protocols to enhance efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central feature of the method involves selective enrichment of transcripts using a capture panel during library preparation. Researchers used molecular probes to isolate 4,737 rare abundance genes and 50 housekeeping genes. These genes were selected because they are typically low or absent in healthy plasma and are more likely to reflect tissue-specific or disease-related RNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/computational+model/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;computational model&lt;/a&gt; was developed to eliminate expression noise caused by residual platelet RNA. This model identified gene patterns linked to platelet contamination and adjusted for them using data from healthy reference samples.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;RARE-seq detected expression signatures associated with non-small-cell lung cancer in 101 out of 139 participants with previously confirmed lung cancer. Detection rates increased by cancer stage, with 30% in stage I, 63% in stage II, 67% in stage III, and 83% in stage IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a head-to-head comparison using matched plasma samples, RARE-seq identified cancer in 34% of cases that were missed by ctDNA analysis, while no samples were detected by ctDNA alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RARE-seq also identified somatic driver mutations in 28% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma as well as 1% of controls. Known variants such as EGFR, KRAS, and RET were among those detected through RNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RARE-seq revealed cell-free RNA expression profiles associated with histological transformation, MET amplification, and drug resistance in patients treated with EGFR-targeting therapies. In one patient, cell-free RNA markers of small-cell transformation diminished following chemotherapy, reflecting a shift in tumor state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For samples unrelated to cancer, RNA from mRNA vaccines was detected for up to six weeks after administration. Transcripts linked to COVID-19 infection, lung injury, and mechanical ventilation were also found, particularly in individuals with recent tobacco exposure or active pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this preliminary validation, RARE-seq achieved levels of detection sensitivity beyond those of current ctDNA-based methods, identifying tumor-derived RNA at extremely low concentrations. Detection of gene activity patterns and cancer-related mutations from a single blood sample enabled detailed molecular characterization of lung tumors and resistance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results imply a much broader utility for cell-free RNA analysis in both cancer and non-cancer conditions. RARE-seq introduces a foundation for future blood tests that capture gene expression changes in a wide range of clinical scenarios. Diagnostic use will require clinical trials in early-stage &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and expanded reference datasets for cell-free RNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple blood test could reveal who is at high risk of skin cancer recurrence after tumor-removal surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test can detect fragments of tumor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a simple blood draw to reveal the lingering presence of Stage III melanoma — a metastatic form of the deadliest form of skin cancer — that can't be seen with CT scans. Although the test isn't perfect, it could help flag patients who need aggressive treatment because their cancer is likely to come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're envisioning the test being used to monitor patients over time (perhaps every month or couple of months in the first 1-3 years after surgery) for an early indication that the melanoma is recurring," study senior author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1205825247/david-polsky" target="_blank" data-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1205825247/david-polsky" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. David Polsky&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologic oncologist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the test showed signs of tumor DNA, Polsky continued, the doctor might choose to use more advanced imaging techniques to search for small, easy-to-miss tumors, or they might move to a more aggressive treatment regimen that uses a combination of cancer drugs instead of just one, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/simple-blood-tests-could-be-the-future-of-cancer-diagnosis" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/simple-blood-tests-could-be-the-future-of-cancer-diagnosis"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple blood tests could be the future of cancer diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanoma is a cancer of melanocytes, a type of pigmented skin cell. It accounts for only 1% of skin cancers, but it causes the most skin cancer deaths because it can quickly spread to other organs, or metastasize. Early detection is one of the best ways to boost the likelihood of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polsky and his colleagues focused on Stage III melanoma, which is melanoma that has spread to nearby &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002247.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002247.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lymph nodes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where immune cells are made and stored. Doctors perform surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible before starting medications to kill any remaining tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-HzhK9FEZe4FiAjzpwST27n" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-HzhK9FEZe4FiAjzpwST27n slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients then get CT scans to look for any signs of recurrence, but some patients have tiny deposits of melanoma that are too small to be detected by CT. To catch those deposits earlier, Polsky and his team turned to circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA. These are DNA fragments released from tumor cells during their normal life cycle. The fragments circulate in the plasma — the liquid portion of the blood — and can be detected by telltale mutations that are unique to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a larger clinical trial of a combination of cancer drugs, the research team studied blood samples from 597 patients who had recently undergone surgery. The participants also had follow-up blood samples taken three months, six months, nine months and 12 months after either starting a treatment or receiving a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after surgery, 13% of the patients had detectable ctDNA in their blood plasma. Every single one of these patients experienced a cancer recurrence, the researchers found. Patients were also more likely to see their melanoma return when their ctDNA rose during the follow-up tests or if the ctDNA remained persistently high over the course of the testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the ctDNA predicted the return of the cancer 100% of the time; no one with a positive test escaped melanoma relapse. But the absence of ctDNA did not mean the patients were out of the woods. A negative test was correct 71% of the time in predicting that the person's cancer would not return. But some patients with no detectable ctDNA still saw recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[T]he tests are highly accurate when they are positive, but not as accurate when they are negative," Polsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's results were published April 15 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(25)00139-1/abstract" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(25)00139-1/abstract" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet Oncology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The next step, Polsky said, is to make the test available to a clinical molecular pathology laboratory, where it can be used to make decisions about treatment. A clinical trial can then show whether using the blood test leads to better outcomes than not using them — a measure called "clinical utility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Demonstrating clinical utility of the test would be a major advance for the management of melanoma patients whose disease has spread beyond the skin," Polsky said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also been a suspect in dementia. Some studies have hinted at a correlation between lower blood pressure and fewer dementia cases, but they were too small and too short to lend statistical significance to the link. It’s also been noted that people with untreated high blood pressure carry a 42% higher risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now a &lt;a href="https://nlcontent.springernature.com/d-redirect/TIDP3869588X1A85522C2ADE48719455668AF40B97CDYI4/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.nature.com%2farticles%2fs41591-025-03616-8&amp;amp;linksource=https%3a%2f%2fnemo-mail-monkey-live.springernature.app%2f15589138%2fpressReleases%2f%5bdossier-id%5d%3feditorialDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpress.springernature.com%26publicationDomain%3dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdx.doi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study published Monday in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; reports that intensive blood pressure control lowered the risk of dementia by 15% and cognitive impairment by 16%. The large, cluster-randomized trial in rural China once again illuminated the role of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/02/hypertension-u-s-china-village-doctors-dan-jones/"&gt;“village doctors,”&lt;/a&gt; the local term for community health workers, who outdid usual care. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is an incredibly important study,” Dan Jones, a past president of the American Heart Association, told STAT. He was not involved in the new research. “Here’s something tangible that now we can tell our patients. This is so important for motivating people to control their blood pressure, and treating it intensively as well.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trial included nearly 34,000 people age 40 and older in rural China who had untreated hypertension. Just over half of the people received care from community health workers who started them on blood pressure medications, adjusting the drugs and the doses as needed to reach a goal of bringing blood pressure below 130/80 mm Hg. These non-physicians also gave participants discounted or free antihypertensive medications and coached them on home blood pressure monitoring, lifestyle changes (such as weight loss, reducing dietary sodium, and limiting alcohol), and medication adherence.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Whole villages were in either the intervention group or the control group, whose members received usual care from their health care providers to reach a more modest target blood pressure of below 140/90 mm Hg. People who got more intensive guidance in the intervention villages took an average of three different blood pressure drugs, compared to one that people in the control villages were given.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After four years, the intervention group achieved better blood pressure control as well as a 15% reduction in dementia and a 16% reduction in cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our study is the first to report a statistically significant reduction in the risk of all-cause dementia associated with antihypertensive treatment, providing strong evidence to support its use for the primary prevention of dementia,” study author Jiang He, a physician and professor of epidemiology at UT Southwestern, told STAT in an email. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The non-physician community health care providers have garnered attention before for their success at controlling blood pressure and reducing risk for cardiovascular disease. Well-trained but not M.D.s, they’ve helped thousands of people living with high blood pressure in rural regions, studies in the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)00325-7/abstract#%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lancet&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2820165?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamacardio.2024.1463" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 focused on cardiovascular risk have said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Village doctors are seen as key players in places with lower income, Jones wrote in an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2820166" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; that appeared with the JAMA Cardiology paper.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This focus on low-resource settings would be a comprehensible recommendation if hypertension control rates were much better in high-resource settings, such as in the U.S. This is not the case. Might it be that this simple approach would be useful not only in low-resource settings but in high-resource settings as well?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of American adults have blood pressure higher than 130/80 mm Hg, three-quarters of whom do not have it under control, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. Much like the village doctors in China, community health workers lowered blood pressure among certain populations in New York, this &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.122.009321" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated. But an effort  in Maryland and Pennsylvania had mixed results, a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069622" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next research steps might be longer studies in different populations with more frequent cognitive assessments, the paper’s authors and outside experts suggested.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is encouraging that the intervention worked in real-world, rural settings using non-physician healthcare workers. However, this four-year study cannot tell us whether the benefits will last in the long-term,”  Richard Oakley, associate director of research and innovation at the U.K.’s Alzheimer’s Society, said in a statement. “Although no single behaviour is guaranteed to prevent dementia, we know that what’s good for your heart is often also good for your head.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s strength in establishing cause and effects helps solidify what’s been advanced before as a correlation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It would take a lot of money, a lot of years, but I think if you take the results of this study and extrapolate to what it might mean for younger and middle-aged patients, the impact could really be astounding,” Jones said. “But you have to do the studies to know that for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/31/almost-half-of-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about half of cases&lt;/a&gt; could be prevented or delayed by addressing 14 risk factors including hearing impairment, smoking, obesity, excessive alcohol consumption and social isolation – as well as high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now researchers say tackling the last of these could reduce the risk of dementia by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Antihypertensive treatment can prevent dementia in patients with uncontrolled hypertension,” said Prof Jiang He, the co-author of the study, from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. “Given the high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension worldwide, this effective intervention should be widely adopted and scaled up to reduce the global burden of dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03616-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Writing in the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers in China and the US reported how the trial involved 33,995 people aged 40 years and over with uncontrolled high blood pressure, spread across 326 villages in rural China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The team randomly selected 163 of these villages, with the 17,407 participants who lived there given intensive blood pressure management from non-physician community healthcare providers, often called “village doctors”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This included free or cheap medications to lower blood pressure, given at tailored doses, health coaching to help them stick to medications and lifestyle modifications – such as weight loss, alcohol reduction and reducing salt intake – and equipment and instructions to monitor blood pressure at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The other 163 villages – encompassing 16,588 participants – received “usual care” – meaning participants’ blood pressure was managed in their normal clinical settings. While lifestyle changes were recommended and some took blood pressure-lowering drugs, this group did not receive free at-home blood pressure monitors or medications, or coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When the researchers followed up with the participants after four years, they found 668 of those in the intensive blood pressure management group had dementia, compared with 734 in the usual care group – with analyses suggesting the former group had a 15% lower risk of dementia. Further work revealed this group had a 16% lower risk of cognitive impairment without dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the team noted that the cognitive function of participants was not assessed at the start of the study, they said the similarity of participants in the two groups means this is unlikely to skew the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a1f21aba-aaa2-48c2-a38a-57dae8d243a2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Amid all the warnings about a ‘dementia tsunami’, here are the things you should know | Devi Sridhar","elementId":"a1f21aba-aaa2-48c2-a38a-57dae8d243a2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/08/warnings-dementia-tsunami-research-hope"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, Prof Joanna Wardlaw, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said the study could not unpick the relative contribution of optimal blood-pressure control and lifestyle changes on the reduction in dementia risk, suggesting the results reflected a combined effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Others said similar research should now be carried out with longer follow-up periods, and added that the approach also needed to be trialled in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Tara Spires-Jones, the director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said the research “provides further strong evidence supporting the importance of managing blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks to protect the brain during ageing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But, she added: “It is important to note that treating high blood pressure was not a foolproof guarantee as some people receiving treatment still developed dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 15:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxNSWVkM1VvbXVod1pSdkhLY2pwdXR5THVOUHB4TWVKZVE4S21xTmhLNDU3WHJHRDJNR1EzV2V0QTZuOXBUSWRodlRickZoOXE2bW5xWGRMNTFpSVMtdmw0SkxCOFpxYkhNeXJCU2NvTFJqT294UHdMZjBDSTJDZ1VXUjhCRGdjTTZ6TVlYWDdvWFhVTjVGcDVoSXN5dXpFMEhzYXprUnFZa25qRkZZVzgzWWo5dUp2UQ</guid></item><item><title>降低高血压的5种有效方法-印度快报 | 5 effective ways to lower high blood pressure - The Indian Express</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ev-meter-content ie-premium-content-block"&gt;&lt;img class="lazyloading" decoding="async" src="https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/default-ie.jpg" data-lazy-type="lazyloading-image" data-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" data-lazy-src="https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg" alt=""&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s as simple as a 15-minute walk around your home or up the &lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fitness/posture-climb-stairs-avoid-joint-pain-expert-9869705/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stairs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even just 10 minutes after a meal can make a significant difference in your blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose protein over carbs for breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swap plain oatmeal for Greek yoghurt with berries and oats! A protein-packed breakfast keeps you fuller for longer and helps stabilise blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="osv-ad-class"&gt;

					&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ATF_1X1" class="ad-slot"&gt;
					&lt;/p&gt;
					&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for five grams of fiber per meal or snack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibre is key. Try to get 25-30 grams daily by adding fibre-rich foods like berries in the morning, a high-fibre smoothie for lunch, and plenty of vegetables with dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritise 7-9 hours of sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality sleep regulates your blood sugar. Set a consistent bedtime &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fitness/walking-exercise-fitness-health-guide-duration-9392836/" class="" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;routine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and ditch social media an hour before bed to improve your sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress effectively&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce cortisol (stress hormone) by finding what works for you—whether it’s tapping, walking, reading, or simply enjoying a cup of coffee. Less stress, more balance, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adboxtop adsizes"&gt;&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ROTATE_1_300X250" class="ad-slot "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To verify and assess the efficacy of these viral tips, we consulted an expert. Here’s what we learnt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can following these measures really help you lower your blood pressure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Manjusha Agarwal, senior consultant in internal medicine at Gleneagles Hospital Parel, &lt;a rel="noamphtml" class="keywordtourl" href="https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/mumbai/"&gt;Mumbai&lt;/a&gt;, agreed that adequate sleep and stress management help tackle blood pressure. “Try to manage your stress levels effectively while adding simple changes to your daily lifestyle. Focus more on doing things that help you stay calm. This can include deep breathing, meditation, going for a walk, listening to music, watching your favourite movie, or as simple as just lying down on your sofa,” said Dr Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also shared that including fibre and choosing protein over carbohydrates helps with weight management, which can help you feel more satiated and improve your exercise results. “This can help keep your blood pressure levels in check. Individuals are advised to incorporate various exercises or physical activities like yoga, stretching, brisk walking, cycling, swimming, cardio, or strength training in their daily lifestyle for at least 30 to 50 minutes a day,” said Dr Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a sedentary lifestyle, you are more susceptible to high blood pressure, said Dr Agarwal. “Ensure you take out time to move through the day, and especially after a few minutes of your meals for at least 10 minutes,” said Dr Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adboxtop adsizes"&gt;&lt;p class="ie-adtext"&gt;Story continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="gpt_ad_IE_ROS_ROTATE_2_300X250" class="ad-slot "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these, she also emphasized the importance of eating a healthy diet and avoiding oily or junk foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you are someone who actively smokes or drinks alcohol, then you should try to curb this habit. Too much alcohol or smoking can contribute to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/health/this-is-what-happens-to-your-blood-pressure-when-you-add-magnesium-to-your-diet-9722921/" class="" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Quitting smoking or drinking completely can help protect your overall health,” said Dr Agarwal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="id_newsletter_subscription" class="ev-meter-content" data-slug="express-sunday-eye" data-bottom="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;Media Advisory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-04-21T11:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Monday, April 21, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Annual Report to the Nation: Cancer deaths continue to decline&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
Overall death rates from cancer declined steadily among both men and women from 2001 through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall death rates from cancer declined steadily among both men and women from 2001 through 2022, even during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the 2024 Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer. Among men, overall cancer incidence, measured as the rate of new cancer diagnoses, decreased from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021. Among women, overall cancer incidence increased slightly every year from 2003 through 2021, with the exception of 2020. The report appeared April 21, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;Cancer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress in reducing cancer deaths overall is largely the result of declines in both incidence and death rates for lung cancer and several other smoking-related cancers, the researchers noted. New diagnoses and deaths from lung cancer, for example, have declined in both men and women over the past 20 years. Meanwhile, the incidence of cancers associated with obesity has been rising. These include female breast, uterus, colon and rectum, pancreas, kidney, and liver cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also shows that new diagnoses of breast cancer gradually increased over the study period, but the overall breast cancer death rate decreased. Cancer death rates in children declined steadily over the study period; those for adolescents and young adults also declined until recently, when the decline slowed and stabilized. From 2018 to 2022, cancer deaths decreased for each major racial and ethnic population group. From 2017 to 2021 (excluding 2020), cancer incidence was stable among men in each major racial and ethnic population group but increased among women in each major racial and ethnic population group. During the same time period, among men, incidence was highest in non-Hispanic Black men, whereas among women, incidence was highest in American Indian and Alaska Native women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report also included an analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on observed cancer incidence in individual states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico for the first two years of the pandemic. Cancer incidence declined sharply in 2020, likely due to pandemic-related disruptions in health care, but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2021. The magnitude of the 2020 decline was similar across states, despite variations in COVID-19 policy restrictions. The researchers noted that these findings underscore the importance of providing access to health care, even during public health emergencies, to ensure the timely diagnosis of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer is a collaborative effort among the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the American Cancer Society (ACS); and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR).The report provides annual updates on cancer trends in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report is based on cancer incidence data from population-based cancer registries, funded by CDC and NCI and compiled by NAACCR, and on cancer death data from the National Center for Health Statistics’ National Vital Statistics System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thousands of people a year could benefit from so-called voice prosthesis. Their cognitive functions remain more or less intact, but they have suffered speech loss due to stroke, the neurodegenerative disorder ALS, and other brain conditions. If successful, researchers hope the technique could be extended to help people who have difficulty vocalizing because of conditions such as cerebral palsy or autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential of voice neuroprosthesis is beginning to trigger interest among businesses. Precision Neuroscience claims to be capturing higher resolution brain signals than academic researchers, since the electrodes of its implants are more densely packed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has worked with 31 patients and plans soon to collect data from more, providing a potential pathway to commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precision received regulatory clearance on April 17 to leave its sensors implanted for up to 30 days at a time. That would enable its scientists to train their system with what could within a year be the “largest repository of high resolution neural data that exists on planet Earth,” said chief executive Michael Mager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step would be to “miniaturize the components and put them in hermetically sealed packages that are biocompatible so they can be planted in the body forever,” Mager said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk’s Neuralink, the best-known brain-computer interface (BCI) company, has focused on enabling people with paralysis to control computers rather than giving them a synthetic voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important obstacle to the development of brain-to-voice technology is the time patients take to learn how to use the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key unanswered question is how much the response patterns in the motor cortex—the part of the brain that controls voluntary actions, including speech—vary between people. If they remained very similar, machine-learning models trained on previous individuals could be used for new patients, said Nick Ramsey, a BCI researcher at University Medical Centre Utrecht.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p class="" data-start="95" data-end="587"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Morgan, a 93-year-old Irishman, has become a living example of what’s possible when you challenge conventional ideas about aging. Once a modest baker, Morgan now stands as a four-time world rowing champion, a remarkable achievement considering he only picked up the sport at the age of 70. His story not only inspires but also offers valuable insights into healthy aging, as a recent study of his fitness and lifestyle was published in the Journal of Applied Physiology.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="95" data-end="587"&gt;&lt;span id="more-5953"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="589" data-end="827"&gt;Morgan’s case has caught the attention of both scientists and fitness enthusiasts. His story provides hard evidence that aging doesn’t have to mean a decline in &lt;strong data-start="750" data-end="760"&gt;health&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong data-start="764" data-end="775"&gt;fitness&lt;/strong&gt;—it’s possible to defy the odds, even later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="829" data-end="855"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="832" data-end="855"&gt;A Body Half His Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="857" data-end="1265"&gt;What makes Morgan’s fitness truly extraordinary is how his body compares to someone much younger. Researchers have found that his &lt;strong&gt;heart&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="998" data-end="1013"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-start="1019" data-end="1036"&gt;lung capacity&lt;/strong&gt; align more closely with those of a man in his forties. Weighing in at 76 kilograms, Morgan boasts an impressive 80% muscle mass and only 15% body fat. For someone his age, his cardiovascular and muscular health is extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1267" data-end="1608"&gt;For example, during a &lt;strong data-start="1289" data-end="1316"&gt;2,000-meter rowing test&lt;/strong&gt;, Morgan’s heart rate peaked at an impressive 153 beats per minute—an intensity more typically seen in athletes several decades younger. This remarkable physical condition isn’t just about &lt;strong data-start="1505" data-end="1522"&gt;good genetics&lt;/strong&gt;; it’s the result of a well-rounded &lt;strong data-start="1558" data-end="1578"&gt;exercise routine&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong data-start="1585" data-end="1607"&gt;nutrient-rich diet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1610" data-end="1912"&gt;As &lt;strong data-start="1613" data-end="1629"&gt;Scott Trappe&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State University, points out, “The body’s ability to adapt to exercise doesn’t fade with age.” This insight underscores Morgan’s exceptional fitness and proves that it’s not just about luck or age but rather a consistent effort.&lt;/p&gt;

The Fitness Secret That Defies Aging!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofODzzgGl70?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="1914" data-end="1949"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1917" data-end="1949"&gt;It’s Never Too Late to Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="1951" data-end="2226"&gt;One of the most fascinating aspects of Morgan’s fitness journey is that he didn’t start his athletic pursuits until his seventies. His late start has sparked interest among scientists studying the body’s ability to adapt to intense physical activity, even at an advanced age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="2228" data-end="2458"&gt;“The idea that aging equals inevitable decline is a myth,” says &lt;strong data-start="2292" data-end="2310"&gt;Bas Van Hooren&lt;/strong&gt;, a researcher at Maastricht University. “Morgan’s transformation shows that it’s possible to build a strong and resilient body even later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2460" data-end="2805"&gt;This is a powerful reminder that it’s never too late to begin a journey toward better health. &lt;strong data-start="2554" data-end="2575"&gt;Strength training&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="2580" data-end="2600"&gt;proper nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; are key to slowing down, or even reversing, the muscle mass loss often associated with aging. According to &lt;strong data-start="2708" data-end="2718"&gt;Trappe&lt;/strong&gt;, the human body still retains the ability to respond to exercise, even in older years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="" data-start="2807" data-end="2846"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2810" data-end="2846"&gt;Richard Morgan’s Fitness Routine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2848" data-end="2993"&gt;So, what does it take for Morgan to maintain a body as fit as someone half his age? His routine is &lt;strong data-start="2947" data-end="2966"&gt;straightforward&lt;/strong&gt; but undoubtedly demanding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="2995" data-end="3182"&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="2995" data-end="3042"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="2997" data-end="3042"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2997" data-end="3042"&gt;40 minutes of rowing several times a week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3043" data-end="3074"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3045" data-end="3074"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3045" data-end="3074"&gt;Regular strength training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="" data-start="3075" data-end="3182"&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3077" data-end="3182"&gt;A &lt;strong data-start="3079" data-end="3100"&gt;high-protein diet&lt;/strong&gt;, far exceeding the daily recommended intake of 60 grams for someone of his weight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3184" data-end="3501"&gt;Morgan’s high-protein diet plays a critical role in maintaining and building muscle mass. As &lt;strong data-start="3277" data-end="3295"&gt;Philip Jakeman&lt;/strong&gt;, a professor of &lt;strong data-start="3312" data-end="3329"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="3334" data-end="3358"&gt;physical performance&lt;/strong&gt; at the University of Limerick, highlights, “Exercise combined with proper nutrition allows us to build and maintain a strong body at any age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3503" data-end="3887"&gt;For Morgan, each aspect of his routine works in tandem to keep his body functioning at an elite level. &lt;strong data-start="3606" data-end="3616"&gt;Rowing&lt;/strong&gt; helps with cardiovascular health, &lt;strong data-start="3651" data-end="3672"&gt;strength training&lt;/strong&gt; ensures muscle maintenance, and a &lt;strong data-start="3707" data-end="3728"&gt;protein-rich diet&lt;/strong&gt; supports overall vitality. His regimen not only defies aging but sets a powerful example of how lifestyle choices can impact health well into our later years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="" data-start="3889" data-end="3921"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3892" data-end="3921"&gt;A Lesson in Healthy Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="" data-start="3923" data-end="4323"&gt;Richard Morgan’s story is a clear testament that age need not dictate our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/the-perfect-water-heater-temperature-to-save-money-without-health-risks/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. His success reveals that a combination of &lt;strong data-start="4047" data-end="4067"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="4069" data-end="4088"&gt;smart nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;, and a willingness to start—even late in life—can lead to remarkable outcomes. By challenging outdated beliefs about aging, Morgan proves that it’s possible to stay physically fit and mentally sharp well into the later stages of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="" data-start="4325" data-end="4643"&gt;As Morgan continues to impress with his feats in the world of rowing, his story encourages us to prioritize health and fitness at any age. His life serves as a powerful reminder: with the right approach, we can all build a &lt;strong data-start="4548" data-end="4563"&gt;strong body&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong data-start="4567" data-end="4583"&gt;healthy mind&lt;/strong&gt;, and a future filled with vitality—no matter when we start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of consciousness is a field crowded with scientists, philosophers, and gurus. But neuroscientist Daniel Toker is focused on its shadow twin: unconsciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His path to this research began with a tragedy — one he witnessed firsthand. While at a music festival, a young concertgoer near Toker dove headfirst into a shallow lake. He quickly surfaced, his body limp and still. Toker, along with others, rushed to help. He performed CPR, but it soon became apparent that the young person’s neck had snapped. There was nothing to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was this very strange experience of watching his consciousness wink out of existence,” Toker tells Big Think. “I was very confused. Here was this person, this body, this brain, and something was lost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It felt not only really mysterious what this thing was, but so ethically and medically important, because that’s the thing where we place all of our moral value; that was the personhood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toker was in grad school at the time, already interested in consciousness and the neuroscience behind it. Unconsciousness was on his radar only as a means to further elucidate consciousness. It was something firm and measurable in a field that often waxes philosophical rather than empirical. But his firsthand brush with death catalyzed a new focus on unconsciousness itself — and a desire to move into medical and translational research. Toker couldn’t save this young man from permanent unconsciousness, but perhaps he could save others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hidden-prisons"&gt;Hidden prisons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now 33 years old, Toker is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Neurology at UCLA. Outside of the lab, he puts a lot of work into his physical and mental health, exercising regularly and gratitude journaling daily, pausing to reflect on the things he’s thankful for. Inside the lab, he focuses on the neurobiology of unconsciousness: What’s happening in the unconscious brain? In this quest, he probes brain organoids in petri dishes, analyzes information flow in the brain, and utilizes deep learning AI to explore the differences in electrical activity between the conscious and unconscious brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toker notes that the quests to understand consciousness and unconsciousness are deeply intertwined, but the latter rests on a more experimental foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s more scientifically and medically tractable to think about unconsciousness,” Toker explains. “Consciousness is a really ill-defined concept. As someone who’s been thinking about this scientifically for a while, I still don’t know what it really means to be conscious. I can’t clearly describe it to you. It’s a lot easier for me to say what it is to be unconscious. And there’s clearly something that changes in the brain when we’re unconscious. It’s a common endpoint of a lot of different things, like deep sleep, generalized seizures, anesthesia, coma. So it’s not only easier to study scientifically, it’s also medically important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

Perhaps his grandest aim is to cure coma and other disorders of consciousness, such as the vegetative state. Coma, a deep state of prolonged unconsciousness from which a person cannot be awakened, afflicts 258 out of every 100,000 Americans each year. Stroke, COVID-19, cardiac arrest, and a traumatic brain injury are common causes. Many of these people live in either a vegetative or minimally conscious state, in which they are fully “awake” but unaware, or only minimally aware, of their surroundings. As many as 300,000 Americans dwell in this gray area of consciousness. Those trapped in this haze are often referred to as “comatose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because vegetative patients are not really able to engage in the world, I think they’re kind of hidden,” Toker says. “I could just be driving past some of these people’s houses and I would never think that there’s this patient there who’s locked inside and basically tied to a bed and can’t move. Because they’re not visible. They can’t go outside and walk. They can’t advocate for themselves. You could be driving past them all the time, and you would have no idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disorders of consciousness can be devastating. They don’t just consume the lives of those directly affected, Toker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re cared for by their loved ones. They need to be on a feeding tube. They can’t use the bathroom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-curing-coma"&gt;Curing coma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how might medical research liberate those imprisoned by unconsciousness? Toker has several ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One that’s in the very preliminary stages is modeling disorders of consciousness in brain organoids: small structures of brain cells grown in petri dishes from stem cells. If researchers can find a way to give them “comas” (as signified by neuronal activity), perhaps via simulated brain injuries, they could test various compounds in an attempt to revert that activity to one emblematic of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another route is through modeling coma “in silico” — in a computer. Toker recently led an &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.16.618720v1"&gt;effort&lt;/a&gt; to train deep neural networks to detect consciousness across multiple brain areas, resulting in a realistic simulation of conscious brain states and disorders of consciousness. This will allow him and his colleagues to test whether varying types of deep brain stimulation can switch an unconscious simulated brain to a conscious state. They could then try these types of stimulation on comatose patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we have a good model of a comatose brain, an awake brain, and an AI that can detect the difference, we can simulate stimulating every single brain structure at the whole-brain level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Daniel Toker&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-saxa-what"&gt;Saxa-what?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toker is perhaps most excited about a potential treatment derived from his own &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12028-025-02217-0"&gt;recently published research&lt;/a&gt;. He trained an AI model on relevant data from the scientific literature to predict whether a drug can “wake up” someone based on its 3D structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The AI was really good at it,” he says. “It could pick up on bioactive structures in molecules that we might not even be thinking about or looking at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the AI model finished its work and returned a list of potential pharmaceutical treatments, Toker was flummoxed. A diabetes medication stood far above all others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m sitting here on my laptop and the AI spits out its top predictions, and I’m just like ‘What’s saxagliptin’?” he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toker tweaked the algorithm’s parameters over and over, and it consistently returned the same answer: saxagliptin. Maybe the AI was onto something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found some preclinical work showing that the drug helps with Parkinson’s and stroke. He then educated himself on how the drug functions. Saxagliptin inhibits DPP-4, an enzyme that breaks down GLP-1, a hormone now widely known because the new wave of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro mimic it to promote satiety. However, DPP-4 also alters the levels of a group of other brain-modulating compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What became clear is that they seem to address all the known pathophysiologies of disorders of consciousness,” Toker found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Toker had this promising result, but he still didn’t know if it meant anything. He and his colleagues then cross-referenced it with something much more concrete. He checked UCLA’s medical records of thousands of coma patients, and it became clear that people who were coincidentally on saxagliptin or other similar-acting drugs like Wegovy woke up from comas at significantly higher rates than coma patients who weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists know of other drugs that can boost arousal and awareness in comatose patients, but they are minimally effective. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5614270/"&gt;Amantadine&lt;/a&gt;, an antiviral also used for Parkinson’s, is most frequently used. The sedative &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/ambien.html"&gt;Ambien&lt;/a&gt; can also be weirdly effective. In rare instances, comatose patients regain awareness when the drug kicks in, but then lose awareness when it wears off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toker says that saxagliptin could be a new, more promising pharmaceutical tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s tantalizing about this class of medication — it’s acting through a completely different set of pathways that’s different from anything else that we’ve looked at for disorders of consciousness and coma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trialing-a-promising-treatment"&gt;Trialing a promising treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over video call, Toker was excited about the prospect of testing saxagliptin in a clinical trial on comatose patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People want their loved ones back. Especially in these chronic cases, it’s so difficult, because they’re there. They’re alive. They’re breathing. They’re going to sleep. They’re waking up. But they’re not responding to anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sharply tempering his excitement is the bleak state of funding for research into disorders of consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t something that pharmaceutical companies really care about,” he says. Federal grants for this type of speculative research are also hard to come by, particularly for early-career scientists. And the cost of the ideal trial he envisions would easily exceed six figures. He would want at least 30 comatose patients to participate, so as not to miss a rare but meaningful effect: Someone might just regain awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment also lessened missed work time, reduced work efficiency, and overall work impairment due to &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), according to the researchers. TITAN participants whose condition improved with treatment tended to work more hours than those who remained stable or worsened, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tysabri infusion also was found to improve life quality for the RRMS patients taking part in the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overall work impairment and overall activity impairment decreased with [Tysabri] treatment, and people with MS on [Tysabri] reported reduced physical and psychologic impact of MS,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their study, “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40120-025-00725-x"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Impact of Natalizumab on Productivity and Ability to Work in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis in France: The TITAN Study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neurology and Therapy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Significant improvements seen for patients at 6, 12 and 18 months&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MS is an inflammatory condition marked by damage to certain parts of the brain and spinal cord, resulting in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;neurological symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as walking difficulties, numbness and tingling, pain, excessive fatigue, and vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the condition can arise at any age, MS most commonly manifests in people between the ages of 20 and 40, a time when most adults are working. Accordingly, most MS patients in France — 8 of every 10 in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1352458517708125"&gt;one study in the country&lt;/a&gt; — reported that the condition negatively impacted their work productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt;, known as DMTs, have &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/89/11/1200"&gt;positively impacted the working ability&lt;/a&gt; of people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of researchers in France specifically launched TITAN to gauge the impact of the DMT Tysabri on the work productivity of employed adults with RRMS. &lt;a href="https://www.biogen.com/"&gt;Biogen&lt;/a&gt;, the company that markets the medicine, sponsored the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 162 RRMS patients in the study were receiving Tysabri for the first time or had been given no more than one treatment infusion before the study. The mean age of the participants was 36.8, and slightly more than three-quarters were women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the year before starting Tysabri, most patients (80.6%) experienced relapses, with about half (48.1%) reporting one relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, “significant improvement was seen in overall activity impairment” — meaning impairments were lessened — at six months, one year, and 1.5 years after starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Psychological impact of RRMS seen to ease with Tysabri infusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team noted that the number of working hours markedly dropped from Tysabri initiation through one year of treatment, during the time of the COVID-19 lockdown in the country (mean 1,224.9 vs. 808.3 hours), demonstrating a drop in “annual mean … productivity.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Work productivity after the lockdown was substantially decreased, suggesting that this reduction in productivity at 12 months [the primary outcome] may be related to the lockdown,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In patients with stable disease, as assessed by scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), working hours per year decreased by 76.9 after one year of Tysabri and by 315 hours among those with worsening disability. Conversely, patients with less disability worked 190.7 hours more per year after starting Tysabri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In patients with sick leave related to MS in the year before Tysabri, the annual productivity remained stable the year after (mean 1,298 vs. 1,247 hours). At 12 months, the proportion of patients who took at least one period of sick leave was similar to before treatment (64.2% vs. 66%), but was higher among those who took at least three sick leave periods (19.1% vs. 10.5%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One year of Tysabri significantly attenuated time missed from work (mean 25.3% vs. 17%), reduced work efficiency (mean 25.2% vs. 18.4%), overall work impairment (mean 26.4% vs. 19.1%), and overall activity impairment (mean 37% vs. 26.3%), as measured by the WPAI-MS questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;These findings suggest that early treatment with [Tysabri] may improve the work function of patients with MS, thereby decreasing the economic burden of the disease and improving patient quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In quality of life measures, the psychological impact of RRMS lessened after 12 months of Tysabri, as indicated by a drop in scores on the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (mean 31.8 vs. 26.7 points). Physical impact scores also improved (mean 19.4 vs. 16.7 points). As assessed with the EQ-5D-3L, quality of life scores remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clinical measures, the number of relapses per year significantly decreased before and after Tysabri (1.2 vs. 0.1). While EDSS scores for disability improved overall with Tysabri, there was no change in EDSS scores for most patients (77.4%) after one year of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, within six months of starting on Tysabri infusion, “patients in France reported improved work function, as noted by decreases in absenteeism, … overall work impairment, and overall activity impairment. … These improvements were maintained at 18 months of follow-up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the team concluded, “these findings suggest that early treatment with [Tysabri] may improve the work function of patients with MS, thereby decreasing the economic burden of the disease and improving patient quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

chemical levels, said Miriam Diamond, a study co-author and environmental chemist at the University of Toronto. One mattress’s weight was 3% flame retardant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We were really shocked to find what was in the mattresses,” Diamond said. “The kids are getting quite a dose of this stuff.” The study was done in partnership with the Green Science Policy Institute in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Phthalates and flame retardants are classes of chemicals with compounds linked to serious health issues like cancer, reproductive harm, genital malformation, neurological damage, hormonal disruption and early puberty. Exposure to some types of flame retardants is strongly linked to lower IQs in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Phthalates are typically used as plasticizers that help materials bend, and are added to plastic mattress covers, but they were also detected in non-plastic covers, which surprised the authors, Diamond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some types of phthalates are restricted for use in children’s products in the US because of their high toxicity, and the levels in four mattresses exceeded those. No limits exist for other concerning phthalate compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;UV filters are added to textiles to prevent dyes from deteriorating, and research has increasingly raised concerns about potential health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Mattresses need to meet flammability standards to prevent fires from spreading, so most companies use flame retardants. However, public health advocates and even some &lt;a href="https://earthjustice.org/feature/firefighters-turn-up-the-heat-on-flame-retardants" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;firefighting organizations&lt;/a&gt; say flame retardants are largely ineffective and do more harm than good because of their toxicity both to people exposed to them in products, and firefighters who encounter them in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No federal limits for flame retardant levels in mattresses exist in the US or Canada, but several types of flame retardants that are outright banned in one of the countries, or restricted from use in kids’ products, were found in the mattresses. TCEP, for example, constituted 1% of the weight of one mattress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Detox Your Kitchen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"detox-your-kitchen","successDescription":"A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries."}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mattresses made of natural materials such as cotton or latex are less likely to have phthalates, though it’s not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Setting mattresses outside to off-gas after purchase can help get rid of some chemicals, but not all, as phthalates and flame retardants could take years to seep away. Diamond said adding a protective barrier like a terry cloth towel that’s good at absorbing chemicals can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But ultimately, “the onus is on the mattress manufacturers” to stop using toxic chemicals, Diamond said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The mattress manufacturers need to be more vigilant,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxNdExqQnBiVDZjOHl2ZVRZR2poaGVfRlpvX3kxc2ZVVUhibWwtRnhJdUFpc1NXOUEyeV9MdGI3a1lQTWFLeXVMZXo1RS1HNkZXY3NDejR5QUp5UzBLbDdHZGR6dDEwNUQ1bnpQYXY1ZDBfWEtGYmhPMlQ0YjFDMEtjdWZCckw5WlhCeHV2Tkp2bWF0OU0zQTJj</guid></item><item><title>新报告称，癌症死亡率正在下降，但女性的诊断率正在上升- CNN | Cancer death rates declining, new report says, but diagnosis rates are on the rise for women - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE04bE1wWEkzRThOZGg3LTU2R1lpODJaQ2lKYVU5VFd5S0duWFluNFJId2lsNDFqNlBfT2ZyT0FEUWtodlNZSkZ6Z05LU1RabXN4ZmN1SXlOc05ES0x6Q3lGOGxrOHdVZkJoN0ZmN2RGU2ZoNkdjODBodU5BQdIBckFVX3lxTFB4TzEzYVRqMUR2RjRoUFdHSEFuamFrSXRQejF4ZVVzX2pHRUxJbG8yVzg5T0I2STg2dEhoXzJTOVZBMzdsNGNsLVZ3LTJiVjE0WFVSVFItZjJHeVJ4aXhtd3YyRHlBeUtUWTlVTjBFZDNnZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            A new report on cancer in the US shows a steady decline in overall deaths from 2001 through 2022. The rate of diagnoses among men fell from 2001 through 2013 and then stabilized through 2021 but these incidence rates among women increased slightly every year between 2003 and 2021.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000053b6o8hgiv9gt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those trends were interrupted in 2020, when cancer incidence rates fell significantly, &lt;a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/report_to_nation/" target="_blank"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt; shows, possibly because of disruptions in medical care related to the Covid-19 pandemic. After 2020, they returned to expected levels. “Because fewer cancers were diagnosed in 2020, especially through screening, we may see a larger percentage of cancers diagnosed at a late stage in future years,” the report says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000063b6odgesjxa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 2024 Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer was published Monday in the journal Cancer. It’s based on data from cancer registries funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US National Institutes of Health’s National Cancer Institute, and it’s released by those institutions, the American Cancer Society and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000073b6obw3h0sn5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Overall, cancer incidence and death rates continue to decline, representing changes in risk factors, increases in screening utilization, and advances in treatment,” the researchers write. “However, sustained disparities by race and ethnicity emphasize the need to fully understand the factors that create these differences so that they can be mitigated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000083b6ot7p6r2i3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fewer people in the US are using tobacco, helping lower incidence and death rates for smoking-related cancers like lung, bladder and larynx, the report says. And these sustained declines in lung cancer have been a major contributor to the overall improvements in cancer death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q000093b6oo38zdqrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, incidence rates are on the rise for several other cancers, including those linked with excess weight, such as pancreas and kidney cancers; uterine, breast and liver cancers among women; and colon and rectal cancers among adolescents and young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000a3b6o20gmhhgf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/16/health/young-women-cancer-incidence-report-wellness/index.html"&gt;Previously published research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that cancer diagnoses are shifting from older to younger adults and from men to women. Middle‐age women now have a slightly higher cancer risk than their male counterparts, and young women are nearly twice as likely to be diagnosed with the disease as young men, according to an American Cancer Society report published earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000b3b6ot870r1pw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new report shows that incidence rates among women have risen 0.3% each year. The largest observed increase among women was for stomach cancer, which the researchers say may be largely due to a change in the classification of tumors by the World Health Organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000c3b6out0bzsq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rates of breast cancer diagnoses are also gradually increasing, driven mostly by types of cancer that have been associated with factors like obesity, alcohol use and age when someone gives birth for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000d3b6oze18y7n2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data continues to show large racial disparities. For example, Black women have a 40% higher rate of death from breast cancer than White women, and their rate of death from uterine cancer is double that of White women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r3a1q0000e3b6o14ohnxve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Differences in access to care and less use of diagnostic procedures and treatment may account for some of the difference, the researchers say. “One additional potential risk factor disproportionately affecting Black women is the use of chemical &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/11/health/fdas-formaldehyde-hair-products-trump-administration/index.html"&gt;hair relaxers&lt;/a&gt;, which may be associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer among postmenopausal women.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9r48mzm00003b6onmxinsy3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Changing habits such as stopping tobacco use, staying at a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet with fruits and vegetables, avoiding alcohol and protecting skin can all reduce risk of cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/screening/american-cancer-society-guidelines-for-the-early-detection-of-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;Screening&lt;/a&gt; can help find and treat cancers early, before they spread. Screenings are available and recommended for certain people for breast cancer, colon and rectal cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Most of us have experienced a ringing in our ears – perhaps after a concert or a loud party. Usually, it’s temporary. But imagine living with that same noise constantly. That’s the reality for &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/03/19/the-foods-that-can-ease-tinnitus/"&gt;people with tinnitus&lt;/a&gt;. The effects can significantly impact mental health – especially for the 2 per cent who suffer from “tinnitus distress” – a condition that can lead to severe anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first noticed my own symptoms in March 2020. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/tinnitus-dominate-every-hour-how-to-manage/"&gt;constant high-pitched buzzing in both ears&lt;/a&gt; felt as if a tiny insect had penetrated my inner eardrums and become trapped. I’d feel an overwhelming urge to claw at my head – so agitated by this sound, imperceptible to others – that simply refused to stop. I knew exactly what it was. After all, as an NHS-trained audiologist with a clinical doctorate in audiology, I’d been treating patients with similar symptoms for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What is tinnitus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is described as the perception of a sound in the ear (usually both “bilateral” but sometimes just one, “unilateral tinnitus”) that isn’t presented by an external source, so it can feel uniquely isolating for the sufferer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medically-speaking, when the brain loses access to specific sound inputs, it compensates by increasing neural activity, which is believed to cause the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; of sound when none exists. This hyperactivity can also interfere with the brain’s natural filtering mechanisms. What’s more, the limbic (emotional) and autonomic (stress) systems come into play, potentially increasing our awareness and perception of tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only five per cent of sufferers have “objective” tinnitus – meaning a doctor can hear the sound with a stethoscope. The majority have “subjective” tinnitus, and there is no test to confirm the disorder – we can only diagnose it based on the symptoms reported. Ten per cent of people – myself included – have &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/dont-laugh-selective-deafness-is-a-serious-matter/"&gt;normal hearing according to hearing tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who is most at risk?/What causes it?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of my patients are aged between 20 and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/dont-ignore-hearing-loss-in-your-50s-how-to-fix-it/"&gt;50&lt;/a&gt; – though it can affect anyone, regardless of gender or ethnic background. As tinnitus is commonly linked to hearing loss, there can be a genetic element, and it often increases with age. Exposure to loud noise is a common risk – I’ve treated many musicians and construction workers – but head injuries and certain medications can also trigger symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m now in my thirties and have lived with the condition for five years. Mine began when I was &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/stress/signs-of-stress-eye-twitch-ulcer/"&gt;incredibly stressed at work&lt;/a&gt;, and I’d just had Covid – studies have shown that the virus can cause hearing loss and tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently no medical or drug treatments for tinnitus, and sadly, there’s a lot of “snake oil” out there. But these are the strategies I’ve found so effective that the condition now barely affects my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Don’t ignore your tinnitus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people with tinnitus are advised to “just ignore it”. But that’s not helpful. If I say, “don’t think of a pink elephant,” the first thing you do is think of a pink elephant! If you’re constantly trying to avoid thoughts of tinnitus, your brain thinks it’s a threat and pays it more attention. Instead it’s better to lean into it when it’s flaring up - use it as a gauge of your stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m certain stress plays a role for me, when I’m more stressed my perception of the sound intensifies. This has now become a signal for me to know I’m pushing myself too hard and to take a break. I go into the garden and play with my dog and try to tune into the sounds outside instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;It’s more about your brain than your ears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed there are certain personality types who seem more prone to tinnitus. Those of us who are “type A” who are very highly driven, ambitious and like to be in control can struggle the hardest. Because when we get a medical condition we want to get on top of it as quickly as possible, thinking the harder we work the sooner it will get better. With tinnitus, however, that’s not usually the case. Accepting it’s out of our control can actually help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is brain related, not a physical affliction - it’s not the ears so much as the signal in the brain that’s being generated and triggering negative feelings. Pushing myself harder wasn’t working, realising I needed to change my outlook and spend an evening watching Netflix (instead of chastising myself for being “lazy”) was more what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because no one else can experience the sound you’re hearing there’s a tendency to feel a fraud. I certainly found myself seeking validation from my husband and embarrassed that as an audiologist I couldn’t make my problem go away. Know that tinnitus is uniquely isolating and it’s common for sufferers to avoid socialising, but this can further impact mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Listen to ‘pink’ noise – not ‘white’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might imagine that listening to “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-white-noise-machine/"&gt;white noise&lt;/a&gt;” can mask tinnitus. But I don’t agree. White noise, for example the sound of an electric fan, is more “broadband” – it’s continuous and harsh. Pink noise is a little bit softer, with different frequencies, so it might be the sound of the ocean or running water with modulations which is more relaxing to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Practice good sleep hygiene&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading before bed engages your prefrontal cortex, so as well as being a distraction (especially if you read something escapist, as I tend to) it calms your nervous system. But don’t read in bed, keep bed just for sleeping. Poor sleep can worsen tinnitus, so make sure the room is dark, a comfortable temperature and that your neck is supported (as muscular tension exacerbates tinnitus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Try this easy mindfulness technique&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing mental overwhelm is key with tinnitus, so don’t dismiss mindfulness as too “woo woo,” I promise you it helps. One technique I use to ground me is the “54321”:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look for five things that I can see, four things I can hear, three things that I can feel or touch around me, two things that I can smell and one thing that I can taste, like my coffee. This distraction technique forces you into the present moment, telling me that I’m not just hearing my tinnitus, but I’m actively looking for other sounds and sensations to be in the present moment and stop your mind racing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing exercises also work well, and there’s an app, Oto, specifically designed for tinnitus which is worth trying. Or simply use one finger to trace the fingers up and down following their shape across your palm, breathing in as you follow them up and out as you follow them down. Even sitting with your feet rooted firmly into the ground is a self soothing device which anchors you, reminding you you’re safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another good technique for calming and distracting is to imagine the same vivid scene time and again. I’m in a cafe with a cup of cappuccino. There’s two ladies sitting on the left of me, having a chat, and they’re laughing. I admire the pink jumper one is wearing. It’s a cosy, happy picture I return to as I feel stress rising. When, in my head, I walk out of the cafe I picture myself walking away from the stress and noise and leaving it behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is the most effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBT has been found to be one the most effective treatments for tinnitus. This psychological therapy challenges negative thoughts, helps reduce stress and crucially reduces the fear around tinnitus. When I first noticed my own symptoms I often felt so scared I didn’t like to go to bed if my husband wasn’t there. I notice that “fear” is one of the biggest hurdles for my patients too, so CBT teaches us that tinnitus doesn’t mean there is something wrong or that we are unwell. That’s very important in easing agitation. You may not be able to get rid of tinnitus, but CBT can change your relationship with it so much that it no longer dominates your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As told to Susanna Galton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'They just kind of forget to eat,' DeLauer reveals - seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One common habit? Skipping breakfast - unintentionally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These accidental fasts could lead to lower insulin levels and a boost in glucagon, a hormone that may&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14622837/Daily-pill-replace-weight-loss-injections-like-Ozempic-patients-lose-stone-matter-months-trial-data-shows.html"&gt; help burn fat more &lt;/a&gt;efficiently, DeLauer says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer says another big thing he noticed with people who are slim is that they tend to prefer operating on an empty stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says these people report preferring to train on an empty stomach and they say they can 'think clearer' when they are not full from a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also, lunch is their biggest meal of the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Celebrity fitness and nutrition expert Thomas DeLauer has shared some of his surprising insights around how people with little body fat keep in shape (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer talks about his observations in a video as part of his hugely popular YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He tells viewers: 'I've spent literally years just asking people what they do to stay in shape or what they do to just naturally be thin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some people say "I've just always been this way" but when you start actually looking at their habits... you start finding there's these common denominators.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One observation that has shocked DeLauer is how many slender people love chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While chocolate is often associated with weight gain due to its high calorie and fat content, the fitness aficionado says in small quantities, it could help stave of cravings. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains: 'I have noticed that 60 to 70 percent of people that I know that are thin, they consume a fair bit of chocolate, [mainly] dark chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For me, I love dark chocolate and it kills my appetite and it also gives me an energy boost, that I feel really good with.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer believes that by having small pieces of chocolate occasionally, slim people 'don't feel like they have to indulge in other places' and it satisfies their sweet cravings without going overboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that dark chocolate has a range of health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists believe a chemical called theobromine, found in cocoa beans and abundant in milk and dark chocolate, is an underappreciated natural elixir with anti-inflammatory properties that could be used to treat Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been found to contribute to weight management by enhancing the body's ability to break down fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DeLauer says that most slim people tend to gravitate towards dark chocolate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While you might think it's down to rigorous dieting and hours in the gym, DeLauer says after observing more than 200 subjects over the years, their fat-busting tactics are much less taxing than that&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of their meal choices, DeLauer says slimmer people prefer less fatty foods, and will opt for salads over burgers and leaner cuts of meat such as skinless chicken over a juicy steak.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says in a YouTube video: 'The reality is most [slender] people that I talk to, they don't opt for the fattier cuts, they don't opt for oil.... they tend to just eat that way a little more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Generally speaking, they are the kinds of people that might do two eggs and some egg whites and they might have it cooked dry instead of in oil.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strict portion control is another habit people with little body fat follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has shown that a smaller dinner and larger lunch could be the key to shifting weight, and DeLauer says from his observations, many slim people follow this methodology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on meals and portion control, the content creator says: '[For slim people], lunch seems to be the big meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's like a light breakfast or even skip breakfast, [then a] big lunch and then moving on to dinner, it is just something light and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'How often have you heard that from your thin friends 'it's okay I had a big lunch'... they're aware of that they don't just feel like three square meals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that 'there's a huge metabolic benefit to having a big lunch' and 'a lot of the Mediterranean regions do that'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another of DeLauer's observations around slim people, is that they do the reverse of comfort eating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He muses: 'By and large I've noticed that people that are thin, tend to be the people that starve their feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Meaning when they get stressed or anxious or mad, they tend to not eat compared to people that maybe emotionally or stress eat.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds that it doesn't mean that slim people never comfort eat when they are stressed but 'these are just common denominators based on about a decade worth of surveying people'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the drinks side of things, DeLauer reveals he has noticed many people with less body fat order water with lemon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says whether this is a 'habit or just for flavor' lemon has a multitude of benefits when it comes to keeping weight off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DeLauer says something that has shocked him, is how many slim people are big fans of chocolate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One2021 study out of Germany found that a soluble pectin fiber contained in lemons expands in your stomach, which could help you to feel full for longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shakes are another beverage DeLauer says people with less body fat enjoy, along with an array of supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says they often have shakes for breakfast and these people are more aware of the vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very small amounts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to exercise, DeLauer says many&lt;span&gt; fit people he meets tend to be physically active without trying to be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He reveals one consistent character trait is that they are constantly restless, fidgety and highly strung. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explains: 'They tend to be the fidgety people, the people that move a lot... sometimes a little edgy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's just kind of what I've noticed with them... they're always up around the house, always busy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, DeLauer says slim people will tend to be more outdoorsy than the average person, and they enjoy spending more time outside keeping active or they will ditch driving to walk to a location instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they are naturally more active, DeLauer claims this population of slim people actually spend less time in the gym as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On this final point he says: 'Finally, I notice a lot of slim people are actually the ones that don't spend a ton of time in the gym.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They do quick workouts... they're usually in and out in less than half an hour.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:31:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQUUZGZjdlREo2bDF5VXRZWmlHd2tKRG9JeW95d05sUFJ6RzRhNkttaG1XYktDdm5ObVdLVU42MnNjVWVXd2hoVGNGX1QwcXM3My1kZElSTGI4bFpscDc5bmIzbHpIem1iWjB3cGF2WmRVUG04b1JoQmt3RHZKRG1pR3J4ZzRPTzBuYXRVX3JQa0k2NGdIX3BabFEyZmPSAaIBQVVfeXFMT244MXI2U0RJSTF6VE15SlNCUE1hSXZtTmRDRURCVTR5a2RfWWlXdGpLVDVXQzZrY2RfOUFwdmgzNnFiWF9GMzRRRGt1ZEZaQ202b3ZQbjdKV0RrOHlkUjFsd2JaN0g4QWRHY0xtWEdNV1lMMTNFSzBhQlM3ekE4bFVWZ2FkYlhrZkZ5VHZrbW9ROWw5bDdfTzNFNHFHeDdkSUZR</guid></item><item><title>在美国梅毒病例急剧上升的情况下，特朗普政府牵制了关键的性传播感染实验室--《卫报》 | Trump administration axes key STI lab amid dramatic rise in US syphilis cases - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxPODl4VHZHZWJ6VDl1Qm5PU05MTUVlVWN4eTRUQUFMR3ZRdzVmdk8yeUdCQmRTV2lWOVdlNUZVd1BjT2tTMF9wekVLUHhsVlBCM2NnNDJmd1NYVTc0QXFFcmVia05mSVUwVVB0UEptOVZaYlotMXN1M1hRWWlZT1hySzln?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;’s cuts to a sexually transmitted infection lab at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) comes as some states, such as Wisconsin, announce enormous increases in syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Syphilis mitigation is just the latest example of work in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that will be affected by the lab’s closure, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;

The trend mirrors a nationwide increase that officials at the CDC described only two years ago as a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/nov/08/epidemic-congenital-syphilis-std-cdc" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“heartbreaking”&lt;/a&gt; epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Congenital syphilis is also on the rise. The secondary infection occurs when a fetus is infected with syphilis in the womb. The condition is both highly preventable and devastating. Experts consider even one case a sign of failing health infrastructure, because it is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/17/congenital-syphilis-crisis-us-biden-administration" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;easily treated&lt;/a&gt; with a single-dose antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have a raging congenital syphilis epidemic in this country,” said David C Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. “CDC’s STI lab provides an important backup to confirm results and to tackle difficult diagnosis. We know this is going to negatively impact on our ability to prevent babies being born with syphilis and to prevent stillborns from syphilis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among the most common diseases in the world – and the most marginalized. Years of flagging public health funding already meant that the US had some of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK573159/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;highest STI rates&lt;/a&gt; in the developed world in four diseases tracked by public health authorities: chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV and syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The most recent data shows gonorrhea slightly decreased and chlamydia remained stable, according to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/annual/summary.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC from 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New HIV infections&lt;/a&gt; decreased 12% between 2018 and 2022, because of new government supports, some put into place during Trump’s first term. Trump pledged to eliminate HIV in the US in his &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/03/trumps-state-of-the-union-2019-hiv-1140379" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; State of the Union address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In the short term, we’re going to see a rebound in a lot of this because public health departments are already suffering under the clawback, and people are having to let go of staff and programs that support [pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV],” said Gonsalves. “All this other stuff is collapsing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts have pointed specifically to the highly specialized lab at the CDC, formally called the STD Laboratory Reference and Research Branch, as one of the most shocking cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The lab worked on syphilis and multidrug-resistant gonorrhea, sometimes called “super gonorrhea”. It had the “highest degree of viral hepatitis expertise of any public health laboratory in the world”, according to a letter from the Association of Public Health Laboratories, and the nation’s only capacity to use a PCR test for syphilis, which primarily still relies on mid-20th-century serology testing. The work was not replicated anywhere else in federal or state government, or in private universities or labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All 28 employees were laid off by the Trump administration on 1 April, alongside a total of roughly 10,000 colleagues in cuts imposed by the health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Together with cuts by the billionaire Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has lost nearly a quarter of its 82,000-person workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is very concerning to our ability to maintain a functioning public health system and a world-class system that protects the American people,” said Harvey. “We don’t know what’s going to happen, and we’re very worried about this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Updating syphilis testing was an especially important project for the lab. Although syphilis is easy to treat, it can be difficult to diagnose, even spawning its own medical aphorism: “He who knows syphilis knows medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Symptoms of the highly invasive bacterium can be mild or go unnoticed for years, causing feared outcomes such as dementia-like symptoms or blindness. Congenital syphilis is a special horror: up to 40% of infants who contract the disease in utero will be stillborn or die. Those that survive can suffer lifelong disabilities including seizures, cataracts and deafness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In comments made to the Guardian just before Trump was elected, Dr Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said she was looking forward to developing new diagnostics for syphilis and researching vaccines for gonorrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’ve made commitments to things we can’t back down on – and STIs are a great example,” Marrazzo said. “One of the most frustrating aspects of syphilis in the field is making a diagnosis of active syphilis and then monitoring the response to therapy … So we desperately need new diagnostics.” As part of Kennedy’s cuts, Marrazzo was placed on &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-01/fauci-s-successor-put-on-leave-as-rfk-jr-reshapes-agencies?sref=fqqmZ8gi" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;administrative leave&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Similarly placed on leave was Jonathan Mermin, former director of the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP). In 2023, Mermin described congenital syphilis as “an unacceptable American crisis”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In addition to work on syphilis tests, the CDC lab was charged with investigating cases of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea. Gonorrhea can only be reliably treated with one antibiotic: ceftriaxone. While resistant strains of the infection are rare, they are rising globally – a fact that is only known because the CDC lab was one of three globally that worked alongside the World Health Organization (WHO) to monitor the disease. Trump pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/18/world-health-organization-trump" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;withdraw from the WHO&lt;/a&gt; as one of his first acts as president. It is not clear what will happen to the 50,000 samples of gonorrhea isolates the lab held in freezers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“They’re irreplaceable,” a former CDC employee, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, told &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/05/cdc-sexually-transmitted-diseases-laboratory-closed-by-trump-administration/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt;. “Are they just going to autoclave the whole thing and destroy it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cuts imposed by Doge and Kennedy have also eviscerated expertise and funding for STI research and testing beyond the CDC. The administration’s clawback of more than $11bn ended grants to study STI testing and prevention among trans women in Florida; efforts to improve the health of mothers and babies in the Mississippi Delta region (an area especially hard-hit by congenital syphilis); and a grant to study the best way to tackle the HIV-syphilis “syndemic” in Chicago. HIV awareness campaigns and studies into prophylactic treatment for chlamydia – among many other programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The biggest concern about containing syphilis is the erosion of our ability to ensure people who have the disease or who have come into contact with the disease are taken care of medically,” said Brandon Kufalk, supervisor of the STI unit at the Wisconsin department of health services, about cuts to health infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We want to maintain our capacity to ensure proper medical care is given, that the correct medications are available to medical facilities, to perform contact tracing on individuals, and communicate what is happening with syphilis in our state effectively,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2025 13:28:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPODl4VHZHZWJ6VDl1Qm5PU05MTUVlVWN4eTRUQUFMR3ZRdzVmdk8yeUdCQmRTV2lWOVdlNUZVd1BjT2tTMF9wekVLUHhsVlBCM2NnNDJmd1NYVTc0QXFFcmVia05mSVUwVVB0UEptOVZaYlotMXN1M1hRWWlZT1hySzln</guid></item></channel></rss>
