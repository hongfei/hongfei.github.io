Despite their ability to enhance focus and wakefulness, health experts are increasingly voicing their concerns regarding the potential dangers these drinks pose, especially to the younger population who are their primary consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annabel Gipp, a registered dietitian and contributing writer for the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/energy-drinks-and-young-people.html#:~:text=Physical%20effects%20of%20high%20enery,disturbances%2C%20headaches%20and%20stomach%20aches" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;British Dietetic Association (BDA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, has outlined the serious adverse effects associated with energy drinks, largely stemming from their high caffeine content. Gipp elaborates, stating, "Increased caffeine consumption among children and adolescents leads to elevated blood pressure, disrupting sleep patterns, causing severe headaches, and inducing stomach disturbances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also self-reported instances of injuries linked to hyperactivity triggered by these drinks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these immediate effects, Gipp stresses the long-term implications: "Adolescence is a critical period for bone development, and caffeine has been shown to hinder calcium absorption in the small intestine, potentially resulting in lower calcium deposition in bones. This detrimental effect is exacerbated when energy drinks are consumed in place of calcium-rich alternatives like milk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a comprehensive 2023 review published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/11/2537" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; journal, which analyzed 18 different reports detailing the adverse health effects tied to energy drinks among individuals under 18, it was found that nearly half of the incidents involved cardiovascular issues. These included serious conditions such as heart arrhythmia and arterial hypertension. Furthermore, neuropsychological problems accounted for one-third of the analyzed cases, while 22% reported kidney-related concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings indicated that pre-existing medical conditions played a role in 44% of the analyzed incidents. In fact, the researchers noted, "Cardiovascular adverse health events were documented in 45% of the incidences, including alarming conditions such as cardiac arrhythmia, arterial hypertension, acute coronary artery vasospasm, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection." In some cases, the affected individuals had consumed substantial amounts of energy drinks over several days, while one notable incident involved a healthy adolescent experiencing significant cardiovascular repercussions after consuming only a moderate amount of caffeine (80 mg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further illustrating the potential dangers, the study cited a case from 2011 involving a teenager who suffered from acute renal failure linked to energy drink consumption. The authors pointed to the high taurine levels in these products as a potential contributing factor, noting that "approximately 95% of taurine is metabolized in the kidneys." They highlighted how the consumption of energy drinks might lead to arterial hypertension, metabolic disorders associated with sugar, and weight gain, all of which are recognized risk factors for chronic kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical health impacts, a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2024/01/energydrinksandchildrensmentalhealth/#:~:text=Energy%20drinks%20are%20associated%20with,a%20new%20study%20has%20found." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the Public Health journal revealed a troubling correlation between energy drink consumption and mental health issues in children and young adults. The study analyzed data from 57 diverse studies encompassing over 1.2 million participants from more than 21 different countries, identifying significant associations with anxiety, stress, depression, and even suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shelina Visram, a senior public health lecturer from Fuse, Newcastle University, and co-author of the study, expressed grave concern over these findings. "We are extremely worried about the implications that energy drinks can lead to psychological distress and mental health challenges. These findings represent crucial public health issues that must be addressed promptly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, researchers have lamented the lack of regulatory action surrounding energy drinks, arguing that their widespread availability to children and adolescents is jeopardizing their health. Professor Amelia Lake, the lead author of the study, stated, "Energy drinks are being marketed to children and young people as a means to enhance their energy and performance levels, yet our research indicates they may be causing more harm than benefit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She further noted, "We have raised alarms about the health consequences of these drinks for nearly a decade, highlighting that they are sold to children as young as ten years old for prices as low as 25 pence—cheaper than bottled water." The growing body of evidence suggests that energy drinks pose significant risks not only to the mental and physical health of children and adolescents but also to their behavior and academic performance.Urgent action is needed to mitigate these risks and protect young individuals from the harmful effects of these products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the alternatives to energy drinks?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthier alternatives to energy drinks include herbal teas, natural fruit juices, coconut water, and just plain water. These options provide hydration, essential nutrients, and a moderate energy boost without the negative effects of excessive caffeine or sugar. Additionally, foods like dark chocolate, green tea, and goji berries can also offer a natural energy boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sugar-sweetened drinks related to chronic kidney disease, says study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 04:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>哈佛大学训练有素的营养学家分享了一个将碳水化合物血糖指数降低50%的简单技巧--印度时报 | Harvard-trained nutritionist shares a simple trick to cut the glycemic index of carbs by 50 percent - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAJBVV95cUxQNjV3NGdxZTZCeVlHVHhCa2FZX0JPUkt5dzg4MEZtdTJmbGZPbElVRFhyTUEteXAwNmJFRG9kRERLQXA5RlBLOXFvUnc3REt4TE9nZ1RTSUFEZG9HNDF2VDRqSTZDOG8talh2M1ZrakxBLXFLbW5QdzJBUzJGMlFReVc0VEI2VnkwUlVQNnNFdlB0dGhTTXo0VmY5eHRDaWhZTndVVmVRNnhyekp1QTdaaE9EY0o4SWNIRm5pNEZuT05RcWNvbUVoTFdSVGdzZ2R0ZTh6MDI1X2IyOFhOYzR1dWlBUW5lU0FMX3hSYUdsTVpTblVCc0VIUmZ1SHdIaHM0Ul82VFMtaEp3RGlrMEpJRWNwQzBMYnlGQXBIYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you can eat rice and yet not have a drastic blood sugar spike? What if that bowl of mashed potatoes doesn’t cost you all those burpees? Sounds like a dream, right? Not anymore! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can have your carb and eat it! Yes, that’s right! Dr. Terry Shintani, MD, a Harvard-trained nutritionist with a massive social media following of over 250K, has shared a surprisingly simple method to cut the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/glycemic-index" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;glycemic index&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (GI) of common carbohydrates by up to 50%, potentially transforming how people manage blood sugar and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the technique, let’s take a moment to understand what the glycemic index is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates are an essential part of a healthy diet. These include your breads, cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and dairy products. What happens when you eat foods that have carbohydrates in them? Your digestive system breaks it down into simple sugars, and that enters the bloodstream. Different carbs have different effects on &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/common-foods-that-can-silently-increase-blood-sugar/articleshow/118817066.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a cookie in the morning can cause a sugar spike in your blood, leaving you wanting to eat more and more carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glycemic index (GI) is a measure of the increase in the level of blood glucose (a type of sugar) caused by eating a specific carbohydrate (food that contains sugar) compared with eating a standard amount of glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods that have a high glycemic index release glucose quickly and cause a rapid rise in blood glucose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods with a low glycemic index release glucose slowly into the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glycemic index (GI) affects your body by influencing how quickly carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels. High-GI foods (70+) cause rapid blood sugar spikes, triggering a quick insulin release to regulate glucose. This can lead to energy crashes, increased hunger, and, over time, may contribute to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Low-GI foods (55 or below) digest more slowly, providing steadier energy, better blood sugar control, and reduced risk of chronic diseases.The GI’s impact also depends on portion size, meal composition (fiber, protein, fats), and individual metabolic responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Terry Shintani has now revealed an unbelievably simple technique that can lower the GI of carb staples like rice, bread, potatoes, and pasta. “Yes, you can cut the glycemic index of common carbs by as much as 50%,” he said in a video shared on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here's the secret to lowering the glycemic index of common carbs and it helps you control blood sugar. It's unbelievably simple. Just heat it and cool it,” the nutritionist revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Dr. Shintani recommends cooling the cooked rice in the fridge overnight and then reheating it. “Its glycemic index drops from 78 down to 54,” he says. In case you fancy a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/glass-in-bread-bug-in-beans-and-tomatoes-5-essential-food-items-recalled-across-the-us-due-to-contamination/articleshow/121079817.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;toast&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the morning, the best way to lower the blood sugar spike is to freeze it and then toast it. The nutritionist reveals that this process lowers its glycemic index by up to 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For potatoes, cooking, cooling, and reheating can reduce their glycemic index by 30 to 40%. And for pasta, chilling and reheating can cut the glycemic index by up to 50%,” he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Prince Harry BLASTED For ‘Deadly’ Claims About Royal Family – Friends OUTRAGED Over King Charles Health Reveal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you cool the cooked carbs and reheat them? “The process of heating and cooling carbs causes a cross-linkage and restructuring of the starch, turning some of it into resistant starches. This slows the digestion of the starch and causes a slower release of sugar into the bloodstream. So, try this simple hack on your carbs to keep your blood sugar in check,” the nutritionist suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAJBVV95cUxQNjV3NGdxZTZCeVlHVHhCa2FZX0JPUkt5dzg4MEZtdTJmbGZPbElVRFhyTUEteXAwNmJFRG9kRERLQXA5RlBLOXFvUnc3REt4TE9nZ1RTSUFEZG9HNDF2VDRqSTZDOG8talh2M1ZrakxBLXFLbW5QdzJBUzJGMlFReVc0VEI2VnkwUlVQNnNFdlB0dGhTTXo0VmY5eHRDaWhZTndVVmVRNnhyekp1QTdaaE9EY0o4SWNIRm5pNEZuT05RcWNvbUVoTFdSVGdzZ2R0ZTh6MDI1X2IyOFhOYzR1dWlBUW5lU0FMX3hSYUdsTVpTblVCc0VIUmZ1SHdIaHM0Ul82VFMtaEp3RGlrMEpJRWNwQzBMYnlGQXBIYw</guid></item><item><title>我们询问了5位营养专家如何选择最健康的酸奶-他们都说了同样的话- EatingWell | We Asked 5 Nutrition Experts How to Choose the Healthiest Yogurt—They All Said the Same Thing - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFBxWVl0aDBmZ1BDNFZOTlk0cW1MTGhaYWNMOWdXWGVXR0hXM05QLWllWVdydUFob2VrSGRDZHJCbG50Mks0bGFmeHl3dS1WZERmMWxHdFVnVFZZMXUwTm83TXVQM1MwOENtSEpvV3owTk91eTZsNU50cWxvbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points:" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yogurt can be a great addition to your diet if you know what to look for (and what to avoid).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts suggest yogurts that offer protein and probiotics while being low in added sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary fat from dairy (like yogurt) might not be as problematic as was once thought.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to yogurt, it’s easier to tell that some products are inherently healthier than others. A tub of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/252990/homemade-plain-greek-yogurt/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plain Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is a far cry from something that is studded with brownies and tastes suspiciously like ice cream. Still, there’s more to choosing a good-for-you yogurt than you might expect—and clever marketing can add an extra layer of uncertainty. Meanwhile, the debate around the merits of whole-fat versus low-fat dairy continues to add to the confusion.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remember, too, that the type of milk and style of yogurt can make a major difference to protein content. “Yogurt made from real milk is a good source of high-quality protein,” points out &lt;a href="https://www.examroomnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Colleen Sloan, PA-C, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. A single-serve tub of high-protein dairy yogurt like Icelandic skyr, for example, typically contains three times the protein of an almond milk-based yogurt.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That said, plant-based options like soy yogurt can also bring the protein with about 7 grams per single-serve container.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Low Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s good advice, no matter &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; food you’re selecting: check &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; before you consume. Overdoing it on the sweet stuff can put the “hurt” in “yoghurt,” since too much sugar in the diet may increase the risk of chronic diseases, says Klein. How much is too much? The American Heart Association recommends that men limit their intake to 9 teaspoons (36 grams) of added sugars per day, and women should aim for less than 6 teaspoons (25 grams) per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Eating sweetened yogurt often can cause you to exceed these recommendations without realizing it,” says Klein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ingredients like cookie pieces, sprinkles, and chocolate are easy to spot, of course, but check labels to determine what you’re getting. Even innocuous-seeming fruit yogurts may get more of their sweetness from added sugars than real fruits. “You can look for plain yogurt instead of flavored yogurt to help you limit added sugar, then add some fresh fruit like berries or bananas,” suggests &lt;a href="http://melissatraub.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melissa Altman-Traub, M.S., RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Live and Active Cultures &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Every yogurt is made with bacterial strains, but in some cases, heat treatment kills them off during processing, meaning they no longer provide benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To ensure you’re choosing a yogurt with the digestive health boost of probiotics, look for the "Live &amp;amp; Active Cultures" seal from the National Yogurt Association, recommends &lt;a href="https://www.andreaballenthin.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Andrea Ballenthin, M.S., CNS, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This seal means that a yogurt brand has at least 100 million cultures per gram at the time it’s manufactured, she says. “These beneficial bacteria support digestion by helping break down food and enhancing nutrient absorption, while also replenishing the gut’s healthy microbes.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; High in Essential Nutrients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Did you know &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7944074/foods-with-more-calcium-than-milk/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; isn’t the only mineral yogurt provides? Yogurt can also be a source of phosphorus, vitamin B12, riboflavin, and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Sloan recommends checking labels for the presence of these important minerals. “These nutrients contribute to bone health, energy metabolism and overall nutrient adequacy.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Appropriate Fat Content for Your Needs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For years, health guidance around dairy foods focused on choosing lower-fat versions whenever possible. But today’s up-to-the-minute research shows that dairy fat isn’t the bogeyman it was once believed to be. “Depending on your dietary goals, both low-fat and whole-milk yogurts can be healthy choices,” says Sloan. “Research shows that neither full-fat nor low-fat dairy products are associated with weight gain.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you enjoy the richness of a high-fat yogurt, it can be a good choice for promoting feelings of satisfaction and satiety. “Maintaining a little bit of fat in yogurt helps it taste creamier without excess sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://dietitiankerry.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerry Hackworth, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Also, fat helps absorb certain vitamins and helps to round out your meal.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the other hand, the American Heart Association continues to recommend non-fat or low-fat yogurt for heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If your doctor or dietitian has advised you to stick with a low-fat diet, it’s important to abide by their guidance.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you’ve selected a healthy yogurt, it’s time to put it to good use! With creamy texture and easy blendability, yogurt is among the most versatile foods on the planet. Enjoy it with these expert-recommended tips:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mind the portion size&lt;/strong&gt;. However you eat your yogurt, keep portions in mind. To balance calories and nutrient intake, Sloan recommends sticking to a standard serving of yogurt, about ¾ cup to 1 cup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250955/strawberry-yogurt-parfait/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fruit and yogurt parfait&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; “Adding fruit is a great way to enjoy yogurt!” says Klein. “This will add natural sweetness, color and fiber and makes for a powerfully satiating snack.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use it as a topping. &lt;/strong&gt;Sure, you can dollop yogurt on savory dishes like tacos and chilis—but Altman-Traub encourages using it on sweeter foods like pancakes or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7985443/oatmeal-waffles/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;waffles&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it a dip. &lt;/strong&gt;Hackworth says she enjoys adding spices and seasonings to transform yogurt into an easy, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250924/avocado-yogurt-dip/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;protein-packed dip&lt;/a&gt; for veggies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use it in baking&lt;/strong&gt;. “Yogurt tenderizes the protein in flour, resulting in soft-to-the-bite &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8066253/high-protein-lemon-blueberry-muffins/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;muffins&lt;/a&gt;, pastries or cakes,” says Sloan. “Its slightly acidic flavor adds a bit of tang.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yogurt is undeniably a healthy food, but the ingredients it contains can either elevate or detract from its overall nutritional impact. A product with a pile of added candy pieces and falling short on protein won’t offer the same nutritional benefits as a low-sugar variety made from high-protein milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When making a selection at the store, be sure to turn tubs around to compare nutrition facts labels and ingredient lists. They tell the true story of yogurt’s healthfulness, providing details about protein, sugar, fat and micronutrients.&lt;br&gt;

"In my 12 years as a personal trainer, I've never seen as much hype around the benefits of protein as I am now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The benefits of protein range from muscle building and sports performance to helping with weight loss by suppressing appetite and helping women during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;If you're trying to build muscle you need to consume around 1.6g of protein per kilogram of your body weight each day, says Dr Paul Morgan, a university lecturer in human nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He says for the average person trying to ensure their general health, this figure should be around 1.2g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He thinks many of the supermarket products advertising their protein content are "gimmicky" and warns they might not be as good for you as advertised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think they do have a benefit but we are wary that a lot of them are ultra processed foods and that's a really topical area [in our field] that we don't know enough about," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-737179d2-0 erjHHi"&gt;The risk of consuming too much protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ultra-processed foods have come under scrutiny recently with &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crm30kwvv17o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one study published last month linking them to early death.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He explains that researchers in his field are trying to understand the differing impact on muscles that two similar protein sources might have when one of them is ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another issue is calories because putting on weight is the most common problem people have when they are trying to consume more protein, Dr Morgan explains, as any excess is stored in the body as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some protein advertised snacks and drinks can have as many calories as regular products using similar ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nature Valley's protein peanut and chocolate bars have 489kcal per 100g, while Cadbury's peanut brunch bars, which also contain chocolate, have 485kcal at the same weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Morgan dismisses theories that eating too much protein can damage your bones or harm your kidneys, though there are exceptions if you have a pre-existing health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250428-123652-7bc49a8f4-web-2.20.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/63c3/live/5fb02d80-276f-11f0-9ebe-cd0e86e27cba.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A woman lifting weights in the gym.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Obesity is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00201-1/fulltext#:~:text=A%20report%20from%20the%20International,pancreas%2C%20breast%20(postmenopausal)%2C" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;13 different cancers&lt;/a&gt;. While losing weight reduces that risk, scientists have calculated weight-loss injections have a bigger protective effect over and above shedding the kilos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers in Israel studied 6,000 adults with no prior history of cancer, who either underwent bariatric surgery or took glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) liraglutide (Saxenda), exenatide (Byetta) or dulaglutide (Trulicity). The drugs work by mimicking the GLP-1 hormone in the body, which lowers blood sugar levels and makes people feel fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although those who had bariatric surgery lost around double the weight of those on weight-loss medication, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.%201016/j.eclinm.2025.%20103213" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Malaga, Spain, and published in The Lancet’s eClinicalMedicine, found the reduction in cancer risk was broadly the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bariatric surgery reduces the risk of cancer by 30-42%, the researchers said. Therefore, accounting for the relative advantage of surgery in reducing patients’ weight, the authors found weight-loss drugs were more effective at preventing obesity-related cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The protective effects of GLP-1RAs against obesity-related cancers likely arise from multiple mechanisms, including reducing inflammation,” said co-lead author Prof Dror Dicker from Hasharon Hospital, Rabin Medical Center, Petah Tikva, Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Newer drugs could prove even more beneficial, he added. “New generation, highly potent GLP-1RAs with higher efficacy in weight reduction may convey an even greater advantage in reducing the risk of obesity-related cancers, but future research is needed to make sure these drugs do not increase the risk for non-obesity-related cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A separate &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, presented at the conference and published in New England Journal of Medicine, directly compared weight-loss jabs and found patients taking Mounjaro lost about 50% more weight than those taking Wegovy. Patients on Mounjaro typically saw a 20.2% drop in body weight at the end of the trial compared with 13.7% with Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Prof Mark Lawler, an internationally renowned cancer research expert from Queen’s University Belfast, said while this was an observational study and caution was needed interpreting the results, the results were very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We already know bariatric surgery cuts obesity-related cancer risk by about a third; these data suggest target GLP-1s may cut that risk by nearly 50% – an approach that would be transformational in preventing obesity-related cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Biologically, this makes sense, as targeting GLP-1 dampens down inflammation, one of the hallmarks of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While further work is required on how it works, these data raise the intriguing possibility that a GLP-1 jab could prevent multiple cancers in the general population, including common cancers like breast and colorectal, and difficult to treat cancers like pancreatic and ovarian. This work could herald a whole new era of preventive cancer medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Jason Halford, former president of the European Association for the Study of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; and head of psychology at Leeds University, said the drugs should also be tested in patients with newly diagnosed cancers to see if they boosted survival chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He added the drugs had “the potential to be a new dawn. And it’s not just prevention, weight management in people recently diagnosed with cancer is also critical in terms of outcomes. That would be the next thing to look at. More and more cancers are being associated with obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A team of 54 international experts from 12 different countries issued a joint statement at the conference, calling for weight-loss drugs to be trialled as a priority for cancer prevention. As a result, a UK team of scientists, based at the University of Manchester and funded by Cancer Research UK, are planning a large-scale clinical trial involving tens of thousands of patients, which they hope to get under way within “three to five years”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matthew Harris, at the Manchester Cancer Research Centre, said weight-loss jabs “provide genuinely fantastic weight loss, and may provide an intervention that could be delivered on a population-scale, where we have not been able to achieve this before”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 22:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxPSjMtbGhVazM4NUZqOURXbTlGVzRSWk02ODhBcnVqVDVzMW9sU2VDaTVDVUlaQkRVaG5aZGRGYk5Hc1RRNzJ5U0FBeGNpNWpnRU1YNjJycUtvdnI1SDBodWRwSzByUG1PSTA3RDljeVN6RExEd19CMVlLQ0R2dUt3TE9YUzZ1d0JMYXYwa1Q2b0RueklnY0ljbUszRzhDQlYyYlA1UTBQY2RvSktHeFBpb19tZFV2eGptSGxnTQ</guid></item><item><title>卡斯县报告了两例麻疹病例，使北达科他州的麻疹病例总数达到11例- Valley News Live | Two cases of measles reported in Cass County bringing total to 11 in North Dakota - Valley News Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxNQjNlMUdmM3IyaEZZT3hpU0FZTzNad1dxU2pUYXI0M3E0T3RXVXJkWm1CZV9fT0c1TXZSeHVERDRPVE5VNml0Q09kdTdIOEw1TEFqVjZpcUZNUlhsbThkaF9GNmkta0R5Nm5uQmNqdzFRVV9MVXRKU2FHdlZNQXRqSHFlWnlQeDRUSTVjWWxRTkRtTEw0bVdEUEJVbW80b3l4Q3pGYW1ONV93X3FUaEFMY1hB0gHGAUFVX3lxTFBtdXhJYl91Zm5fOHZBOUo4MlVaRGV3b0RtSDJqU0VuMTJIU3ZkMk5nNExrTjFJbUpfaDdBS0V6amZUVmlBd2NDVDlkNjhsVnEyQUhzXzBhejM5eTRLSjBURjUwa1RqQjJUemtLV1RET0Rybmg2WW50dV9YNGxsdmZ0UEE0aFpiRy1tVUVIb2k3SlkzT01Wd0pWZUUxYkEtc3ktQ2RDT0FlOGo4SDBlUWxGRWNMZFVFZW03UnBjbXp6WDROaE5vUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;CASS COUNTY, N.D.

Exposed individuals who were vaccinated don’t need to quarantine but should still monitor for symptoms for 21 days after exposure. Individuals who have not received a dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine should quarantine (stay home) and monitor for symptoms for 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“The MMR vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after two doses,” said Molly Howell, HHS immunization director. “People who are vaccinated and exposed to measles are not likely to develop the disease. MMR vaccination is critical to preventing the spread of measles in the community. Anyone who is eligible and has not yet been vaccinated is encouraged to contact a trusted health care provider about MMR vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 KVLY.

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study tracked the BMI of thousands of children in the Netherlands at age two, six, 10, 14 and 18, and found that every one-unit increase in BMI at age six more than doubled

higher risk of being overweight or obese in their late teens. But if they lost weight after that age, they still had an elevated chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of the 3,528 young people, 32.3% were considered overweight or obese at age two, with 22.3% at age six, 24.7% at age 10 and 20.6% at age 14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Many of these children were still classed as overweight or obese at 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Jasmin de Groot, of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, said: “We need to understand how children grow and develop if we are to help future generations grow up healthier and give every child a chance at a happy, healthy life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She added: “The first five years of a child’s life provide a fantastic opportunity to intervene and prevent them experiencing overweight and obesity in the years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-8" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

My heart sinks to my stomach just thinking about the panic and confusion at having to defend ourselves for something we didn’t do.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exam was multiple choice and according to authorities the sisters’ answers were so similar they could only have been achieved by cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girls, who were 24 at the time, were summoned to appear first before the Dean and then, one week later, before the university’s honors council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The panel told them that a professor had raised questions of them cheating during the exam while remotely monitoring the answers of the whole class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kellie (left) and Kayla Bingham on their graduation day from Furman University in South Carolina where they both majored and minored in medical sciences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kellie (left) and Kayla Bingham at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) before they were accused of cheating in a vital exam and their future as doctors began to unravel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He asked a proctor to ‘keep an extra eye’ on the girls as the testing went on. She reported that she’d seen them nodding their heads as if exchanging signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said one had pushed back her chair and the other had ‘flipped’ a piece of paper on the table for her sister to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today Kayla remains as passionate in her denials as she was then. She says: ‘There was absolutely no signaling. We never looked at each other and there was no secret language or kind of twin telepathy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kayla says people have frequently commented on their similar body language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile Kellie insists that the twins are so bonded by nature and nurture that their grades have been almost as identical as they are throughout their schooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They’d graded within a fraction of each other in high school and their SAT scores had been the exact same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two had regularly achieved the same results when they’d taken exams on different days and in separate locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But their arguments fell on deaf ears and the council found them guilty of cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was as ridiculous as it was devastating,’ Kayla says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They appealed to the dean. And, after what Kellie describes as the ‘most excruciating week of our lives that felt like an eternity,’ he cleared them of all charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the damage was done. Word of the twins’ ‘cheating’ had already leaked. Few on the campus paid any attention to the fact that the university had found them innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the vast majority of their peers in Charleston, it was a case of no smoke without fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kayla pales as she recalls how college Facebook groups shredded their reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We couldn’t bear to look at the vile comments ourselves,’ she says. ‘But we heard about them from Kellie’s boyfriend and our cousin, another student at MUSC, who had access to the groups.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vicious rumors circulated across the university. Their peers were judge, jury and hangman, calling for them to be expelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In reality, if the twins had been found guilty, they would have had to repeat their second year of med school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Not that it mattered because, despite us being innocent, our “punishment” was much worse,’ Kayla says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kayla (left) and Kellie Bingham. They often used to dress alike and have the same passion for dogs.  Kayla says people have frequently commented on their similar body language&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kayla (left) and Kellie Bingham were always together growing up and excelled in sports such as soccer. They attended the same grade schools before going to the same college and medical school in South Carolina&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gossip gathered pace and reached community blogs in Charleston. Next, a city newspaper highlighted the case, giving identifying details of the twins in a sensational, front-page article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They didn’t name us, but might as well have done,’ Kellie says of what became a series of stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That summer, the twins spent an emotionally tumultuous three months at home with their parents in Columbia and prayed that things would die down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The girls had wanted to become doctors since the age of 12, whether it was working directly with patients or undertaking medical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Our hearts and passions were in medicine,’ Kayla says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had enjoyed their first two years as students, despite the increasingly heavy workload, and made good friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that all fell away in the heat of the scandal that blew up on campus. Both suffered panic attacks — Kayla developed facial and verbal ticks which she still has to this day — and gained and lost substantial amounts of weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, they returned to UMSC in late August 2016. They had no choice, Kellie explains, ‘Our first love was medicine, and we couldn’t just walk away.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the twins were naïve if they thought the prejudice would dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say they walked into student hangouts in Charleston and the place would go silent. People nudged each other and pointed with hostility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It got so bad that the pair had to order delivery rather than eat at restaurants. They were disinvited from two weddings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One bride dispatched a generic-sounding email, saying there had been some kind of mistake. The other simply didn’t follow up after sending a save-the-date card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We’d been known as two of the most social people on campus, but now we were treated like pariahs,’ Kellie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC.) The institution accused the twins of cheating and its board of honors initially found them guilty. The dean overturned the judgement and declared them innocent. But the damage to the women's reputations was done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kayla and Kellie Bingham. The sisters had wanted to become doctors since the age of 12, whether it was working directly with patients or undertaking medical research&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The incident that horrified Kayla the most occurred when a male student deliberately barged into her as she walked along a corridor at school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He literally pushed me into a wall, and I had to go into a maintenance closet because I was so scared,’ she says. ‘I called my parents from the closet, saying, “I can't deal with this anymore.”’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The twins withdrew from UMSC in mid-September. Kayla says: ‘It was at the recommendation of the dean who said it was “better for our safety” to remove ourselves.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Life would never be the same. The twins were consoled by their tight-knit family but cried in each other’s arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Kayla was the one person who’d been through what I had,’ Kellie says. ‘Only she could understand how dreadful it was.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In early 2017, the pair filed a lawsuit against UMSC and sued them for slander and defamation. They accused the institution of allowing the cheating allegations to leak and doing nothing to defend the students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We knew the truth and it was a matter of principle,’ Kellie says of their determination to clear their names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It took five years for the suit to come to court in Charleston in November 2022, partly due to delays caused by Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the interim, the twins abandoned all ambitions to become doctors. Instead, they pivoted to law enrolling in the University of South Carolina’s law school as they became increasingly involved in the machinations of their own case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They gave evidence about the day of the fateful exam and the distressing aftermath describing the trauma that, they maintain, still affects them to this day and changed the course of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile the sisters’ lawyer presented their education records to the court. They showed how they’d received identical or near-identical scores in exams over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A professor from their high school sent a letter saying that they’d submitted the exact same answers — some correct, some not — for an exam he’d supervised a decade earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They’d been sitting at opposite ends of the classroom, and it would have been impossible for them to collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychologist&lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://drnancysegaltwins.org/"&gt; Nancy Segal&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in behavioral genetics and the study of twins, was called as an expert witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the jury about the ‘very close intertwining’ of twins and said cheating complaints are common in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kayla (left) and Kellie Bingham. ‘We knew the truth and it was a matter of principle,’ Kellie says of their determination to clear their names. They were shocked at the prejudice against them, despite being found innocent of cheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Segal, the director of the Twins Studies Center at California State University, Fullerton says that in testifying, she was helping ‘put a terrible wrong right.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For a medical establishment, UMSC showed an astonishing lack of familiarity and knowledge when it comes to twins,’ she says, noting how they’re raised in the same environment and are ‘natural partners in life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Studies have found that identical twins have very similar interests, abilities, achievements and test-taking skills because they are genetically predisposed to perform and behave the same way,’ Segal adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jury took less than two hours to decide in the Binghams’ favor, awarding them $1.5 million in compensation. The sum, Kayla says, was mostly absorbed by legal fees and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But it was never about the money,’ says Kayla, who held hands with Kellie as the verdict was delivered. ‘What price tag can you put on your reputation and name?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today the twins work for a major law firm, specializing in relations between companies and state and federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We miss medicine tremendously and it’s been tough for us,’ Kayla, who, in common with Kellie had been considering anesthesiology, says. ‘But our work is very rewarding, and we feel as if we’re where we belong.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MUSC appealed within the mandatory 30 days challenging the decision on procedural grounds. ‘It’s still hanging over us,’ Kellie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the twins are fiercely proud of their victory in this battle of David and Goliath. Kayla says, ‘It was an agonizing process, but we refused to bow down.” We can always hold our heads up high.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Medical University of South Carolina told the Daily Mail it would not comment on the Bingham case because it involved 'pending litigation'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Or wondered if you need to get this probably minor thing checked out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our modern lives of overworking, poor sleep routines and general life stress all exacerbate a wide variety of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/symptoms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. However, there are some things that, though seemingly small, may require a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Dr Lori Solomon, chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at New York Medical College, and Dr Estelle Williams, ​​medical director for CityMD for the southern New Jersey region to get their thoughts on which symptoms should really not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going to the bathroom too frequently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up in the middle of the night needing to pee is totally normal, Solomon tells &lt;em&gt;The Independent.&lt;/em&gt; But if that’s something you’re doing two or three times per night – every night – that might be indicative of a more serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over-frequent urination can be a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/symptom" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:symptom;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. “When your sugar is high, one of the ways the body tries to get rid of the sugar, is to get rid of it through the urine,” Soloman says. “During the day, you just go to the bathroom more often, but at nighttime, you often have to wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Simple things such as needing to go to the bathroom frequently at night, or pain that causes you to wake up, may be a sign of something more serious that should be checked out by a medical professional (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that other worrying signs can be feeling more thirsty and a significant increase in appetite. “Those are the types of things I think need to be checked sooner rather than later,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain in the night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any pain that wakes you up during the night could be a problem. While pulled muscles, physical injuries, or other discomforts may hinder someone getting to sleep – they shouldn’t be disturbing you once you’re asleep, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're waking up in the middle of the night with a headache, you've got a problem… because usually we don't wake up with headaches in the middle of the night,” she says. “If that's waking you up at night – I'm a little bit more worried about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden headaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headaches are “super common,” and shouldn’t necessarily be considered worrisome, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if a headache is accompanied by other things such as vision changes, nausea tingling in the extremities, weakness – those may be a sign that something neurological is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams cautions those who jump to label sudden, severe headaches as &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/migraines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:migraines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;. “A migraine is actually a very specific &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/diagnosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diagnosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and headache pattern, requiring neurologic evaluation,” she says. “It's good that you get evaluated if you're having a headache that's unusual for you, if it’s very intense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Headaches are super common, but if you’re experiencing extra symptoms including nausea, vision changes or weakness this can be a sign of something else. Sudden, intense headaches, known as ‘thunderclap headaches’ should definitely necessitate a trip to the emergency room (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such high-intensity episodes, coming on quickly and out of nowhere, can be what is known as “thunderclap headaches” should definitely necessitate a trip to the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/emergency-room" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emergency room;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emergency room&lt;/a&gt;, says Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortness of breath or fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another symptom that crops up fairly frequently that shouldn’t be ignored is sudden shortness of breath – especially if it’s not something you’ve experienced before, says Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're like, ‘that's weird. I was just doing my regular activities and I became very winded and short of breath,’ get that checked,” she says. “I would also say, if you take a deep breath and you develop pain in your chest or your back that you've never had before, that can sometimes be a soft sign for a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/blood-clot" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood clot&lt;/a&gt; in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism, that we certainly want to see for sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fatigue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fatigue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; too – while common in many people due to hectic work schedules or other lifestyle commitments – should not be significantly interfering with things you would do day-to-day such as exercising, Solomon adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In very severe cases, fatigue can be symptomatic of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/heart-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, sleep apnea, and even some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indigestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one less obvious and very typical symptom of heart disease. “It's very common for people who are having a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/heart-attack" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; to think they're having indigestion,” Solomon says. “If you’re taking a walk and all of a sudden you feel like, ‘Oh, I’ve got some indigestion’, and then it gets better when you stop walking, that's your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of fatigue and indigestion, unconnected to a big meal, is something that people should see the doctor about, she says. It could be due to a lack of blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams says that bouts of indigestion-like symptoms – pressure or tightness – that last for 15 minutes or 20 minutes can be telling, especially for those who do not typically suffer from indigestion or heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people think ‘Oh, I just ate something weird, and I must have a bubble of gas in my chest,” she says. “That sensation of indigestion is something that can be an indicator of heart disease… It can be a masker of something more serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood in your stool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor your bowels, says Williams, because being constipated or having diarrhea is something that's different is worth getting checked out. And while it may seem obvious, seeing blood in either your poop or pee is definitely something to see a doctor about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having a change of bowel habits – if you see black stool or a lot of blood when you’re using the restroom, I feel like that's perhaps not a subtle sign,” William says. “That's something a little more concerning that means you should come in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often associate blood in the stool as a hemorrhoid, but should not be ignored as it can be a common presentation for &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/colon-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general you generally don't want to see blood in the urine either,” she says. “But that's usually &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kidney-stones" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kidney stones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt; or urinary tract infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon also warns people to pay attention when things just don’t clear up on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there's a cough lasting more than four weeks, you generally want to see somebody about that,” Solomon says. “There's lots of reasons you can have a cough, but generally, if you have a cough after a cold, it generally goes away in a few weeks. So if it lasts longer than a month, we generally want to know about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that things that have been happening for months that may seem innocuous may still be worth investigating. Losing weight unintentionally is definitely something worth mentioning to your primary care doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;There are many reasons that a person can get a cough, though most generally go away in a week or so following a cold. Any longer, and it might be worth booking an appointment to see your doctor (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, Solomon recommends that to avoid anything too concerning, take regular visits to your primary care physician, who is better qualified to notice any changes, concerning or otherwise. She encourages people to be over, rather than under-cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people feel silly about coming in with all these different symptoms, but I don’t think we could expect that people are going to know everything that doctors know,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'd rather say it’s nothing and reassure them than miss something that could be really serious if we didn't catch it in time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 20:48:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1XZUp1ZHFOX0x1elA3WkEzS2QzS05TRXhfWDhzTTlzRVpKYU1NcmJ0aTN0SGxWeEs0aFB5MUE0VnQ3RHJURWNVdTh4TklrbkNoNUxrOUJYeDZRR0tDQzBKR2JwdnZtT24xcWJCSS1FZTBxOV9Fc0hkbUtRUl8</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现了一种可在数周内降低血压的药物- SciTechDaily | Scientists Have Found a Drug That Slashes Blood Pressure in Weeks - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQSExRZ05wQUZRMXlNcWpySVhXYlBDUS1aQU1ZVHlJTjJ0NnF2eXFjNUtJRG1HNFJqNHRqWGYxLUg5Mjd5VEdtNDdFX0ZIMUloRmcyNUNZOUtVV01tQkZ2M25LRTY4WGVONFp1ZXdmbFNET3djb0FhcE1pSmtXTkFGcF82UkQ5c3ZGZllXWE5YNm1pbG1FTWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 20:35:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQSExRZ05wQUZRMXlNcWpySVhXYlBDUS1aQU1ZVHlJTjJ0NnF2eXFjNUtJRG1HNFJqNHRqWGYxLUg5Mjd5VEdtNDdFX0ZIMUloRmcyNUNZOUtVV01tQkZ2M25LRTY4WGVONFp1ZXdmbFNET3djb0FhcE1pSmtXTkFGcF82UkQ5c3ZGZllXWE5YNm1pbG1FTWc</guid></item><item><title>每周进行多少小时的举重训练可以增强力量？令人惊讶的新研究-手册 | How many hours of weekly weight training boosts strength?

&lt;p&gt;In a brand new &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/abstract/9900/without_fail__muscular_adaptations_in_single_set.782.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Medicine &amp;amp; Science in Sports &amp;amp; Exercise&lt;/em&gt;, 42 healthy resistance-trained adults completed a single set of nine common upper- and lower-body &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/beginning-weightlifting/" rel&gt;resistance training exercises&lt;/a&gt; targeting all major muscle groups in each session. Participants lifted twice weekly for eight weeks and were split into two groups:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list" data-block-type="core"&gt;
&lt;li data-block-type="core"&gt;The FAIL group trained to failure on all exercises.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li data-block-type="core"&gt;The 2-RIR group trained with two repetitions in reserve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The workout session was designed to be on the shorter side because people often say that their busy schedules are the reason why they don’t do strength training. The researchers set out to uncover the minimum effective dose where you can still get results in muscle power without spending all of those hours at the gym.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the beginning and the end of the study, researchers assessed muscle thickness for &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/best-biceps-workouts/" rel&gt;the biceps brachii&lt;/a&gt; and triceps brachii arm muscles as well as &lt;a href="https://www.themanual.com/fitness/best-quad-workouts/" rel&gt;the quadriceps femoris&lt;/a&gt;, which are the muscles at the front of your thighs. Researchers also measured muscular strength and power endurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results showed that both groups had noticeable gains, with muscle growth being a little more prominent in the FAIL group. There were similar increases in strength and local muscular endurance in both groups. During those two months, the 42 adults gained significant muscle mass and strength even with just two 30-minute sessions a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a small study, it shows that single-set routines can certainly be a time-efficient way to promote muscular growth and power, even when transitioning from higher-volume programs. Strength training in shorter durations provides health benefits, builds muscle, and fits into your busy schedule. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even just one hour a week can yield results, so it’s worth making room in your schedule to prioritize your fitness and wellness and lift those weights. Another &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/13/755" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showed that those who did just 30 to 60 minutes of weekly strength training had a 10 to 20% lower risk of complications and fatality from conditions like cancer and heart disease, compared to those who didn’t do any resistance training. I think I might squeeze in a resistance training session later today.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Not only must your brain maintain a vast archive of existing memories, but it also has to keep track of new stuff each day. That requires getting ready to deal with new memories before they occur, even while processing old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's well-known that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-almost-doubles-our-chances-of-remembering-forgotten-things-study-finds"&gt;sleep is important for memory&lt;/a&gt; and learning, among other things, but we're still figuring out many of the precise mechanisms involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, it's seen as a backwards-facing process: We experience something, the memory of it is then processed and preserved during subsequent nights of sleep, and we can recall it at will later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, however, sleep seems to help us process not just past memories, but also future ones. In addition to consolidating and conserving memories while we sleep, the study suggests our brains are also actively preparing us to record upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory is a broad, multifaceted phenomenon that helps make us who we are, and from our subjective perspective it can seem almost magical, somehow beyond discrete components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not, though. At a cellular level, groups of specialized neurons known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engram_(neuropsychology)"&gt;engram cells&lt;/a&gt; physically encode our life experiences in a format we can recall later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has made it clear &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-more-about-how-the-brain-strengthens-memories-during-sleep"&gt;sleep is crucial&lt;/a&gt; for this process to work properly, but many physiological details remain unclear. On top of merely storing memories, our brains also perform incredible feats of processing and organization, much of which occurs during mental downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers in Japan sought to learn more about the role sleep plays in memory processing, including the preparation for memorable experiences that haven't happened yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ir0pT8grfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors used an imaging system for freely moving mice that can reveal both engram and non-engram cells across the stages of memory processing. They were able to track neuronal activity before, during, and after memorable events the mice experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shed new light on the behavior of specific neuron populations under various cognitive conditions, including while mice slept both before and after learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results highlighted two parallel processes unfolding in post-learning slumber. First, engram cells that initially encoded a memory showed predictable reactivation patterns, part of the brain's well-documented procedure for consolidating memories during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed another interesting population of neurons, which weren't yet associated with specific memories. These "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w"&gt;engram-to-be cells&lt;/a&gt;," as the researchers call them, grew increasingly synchronized as mice slept after learning. Later, the same neuron groups went on to encode new, different memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Engram-to-be cells exhibited increased coactivity with existing engram cells during sleep, suggesting that this interaction helps shape new memory networks," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Kaoru Inokuchi, a professor of biochemistry at the University of Toyama in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed a neural network model to simulate activity in the hippocampus, hoping to further illuminate the underlying mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model pointed to synaptic &lt;span&gt;depression&lt;/span&gt; and scaling, phenomena known to modify neuronal connections during sleep, as likely important for organizing these engram-to-be cells – a service that dwindled in the model when those mechanisms were disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engram and engram-to-be cells showed intriguing co-activation in post-learning sleep, the study found, hinting at some coordination or even data transfer between the neural networks for past and upcoming memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests sleep quality between learning events may influence not only our retention of what we've learned so far, but also how well we'll retain new information in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed, this could be valuable insight for education and treatment of memory disorders, and it could help uncover novel ways to help people maximize their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe that manipulating brain activity during sleep or sleep patterns may uncover methods to enhance memory by unlocking the brain's latent potential," Inokuchi &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above all, however, these findings add to the mountain of existing evidence that we should all take sleep seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want people to understand that sleep is not just about rest – it plays a crucial role in how the brain processes information," Inokuchi &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1081734"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "With that in mind, we hope everyone will begin to value sleep more and use it as a way to improve their overall quality of life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-58860-w"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1785 English philosopher Jeremy Bentham designed the perfect prison: Cells circle a tower from which an unseen guard can observe any inmate at will. As far as a prisoner knows, at any given time, the guard may be watching — or may not be. Inmates have to assume they're constantly observed and behave accordingly.

"It's one of the first topics to have been studied in psychology," says Clément Belletier, a psychologist at University of Clermont Auvergne in France. In 1898 psychologist Norman Triplett showed that cyclists raced harder in the presence of others. From the 1970s onward, studies showed how we change our overt behavior when we are watched to manage our reputation and social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But being watched doesn't just change our behavior; decades of research show it also infiltrates our mind to impact how we &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;. And now a new study reveals how being watched affects unconscious processing in our brain. In this era of surveillance, researchers say, the findings raise concerns about our collective mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/id-never-seen-such-an-audacious-attack-on-anonymity-before-clearview-ai-and-the-creepy-tech-that-can-identify-you-with-a-single-picture" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/id-never-seen-such-an-audacious-attack-on-anonymity-before-clearview-ai-and-the-creepy-tech-that-can-identify-you-with-a-single-picture"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I'd never seen such an audacious attack on anonymity before': Clearview AI and the creepy tech that can identify you with a single picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="watchful-eyes-3"&gt;Watchful eyes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being looked at grabs our attention, as demonstrated by the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17278526/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17278526/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stare-in-a-crowd effect&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: amid a sea of faces that aren't looking at us, we immediately detect a single one that is.

"These tendencies emerge very early" and are present across the animal kingdom, says Clara Colombatto, who studies social cognition at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.

Some studies have even suggested that theft or littering could be reduced merely by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082055" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082055" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;posting pictures of eyes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This kind of thinking led to the idea that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-illusion-of-being-observed-can-make-you-better-person/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-illusion-of-being-observed-can-make-you-better-person/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surveillance could be used for social good&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — to prevent crime, for instance — echoing Bentham's methods for controlling incarcerated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that people behave differently under watchful eyes isn't surprising. Who among us hasn't acted more selfishly when they were alone than they would when someone could see them? Psychologists put this down to concern with one's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But over the past few decades, researchers have found that being watched also affects &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721419829699" target="_blank" data-url="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0963721419829699" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cognitive functions such as memory and attention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For one thing, it can be very distracting. One study found that participants &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27357954/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27357954/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;performed worse on a working memory&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; task when they were presented with pictures of people looking at them compared with when they were shown pictures of people with averted eyes. The researchers concluded that a direct gaze grabs participants' attention and diverts their attentional resources from a given task. Other studies have found that more functions, ranging from our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00671/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00671/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spatial cognition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027716302360" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027716302360" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;language processing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; abilities, are similarly taxed by a watchful stare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="unconscious-effects-3"&gt;Unconscious effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of surveillance on cognition go even deeper — into our brain's unconscious processing of the world around us. In a study published last December, researchers showed that being watched accelerated participants' unconscious analysis of faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by neuroscientist Kiley Seymour of the University of Technology Sydney used a technique called continuous flash suppression, or CFS, to measure how quickly people detected visual stimuli that initially escaped their conscious awareness. This technique involves presenting moving, colored patterns to one eye, which can delay awareness of images presented to the other eye. Previous studies showed that people would become aware of a suppressed image more quickly if it was more salient. For example, one CFS study found that participants became aware of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027711000345" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027711000345" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;faces looking at them&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; faster than faces with averted eyes, showing that our brain processes gaze direction before we even know that we've seen anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seymour and her colleagues wondered whether this unconscious processing might also be affected by knowing one is being watched. They had a group of people witness cameras being set up to send a live feed of them to another room. The participants were then shown faces that were suppressed by CFS, and they were asked to press buttons to indicate each face's location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the "watched" group &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2024/1/niae039/7920510" target="_blank" data-url="https://academic.oup.com/nc/article/2024/1/niae039/7920510" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;perceived faces faster and more accurately&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than those in the control group, who performed the same task without the overt surveillance. The difference was nearly a second. "That's big for these types of unconscious processes," says Colombatto, who was not involved in this study. Although the surveilled participants reported that they felt that they were being watched, they did not think this affected their performance. The effect was specific to faces — it did not occur for neutral stimuli such as abstract patterns — meaning being watched didn't just increase arousal or effort across the board. The fact that this unconscious process is influenced by inferring an observer's presence "shows just how sophisticated social perception is," Colombatto says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, researchers assumed the effects of being watched come from seeing people's eyes, but Colombatto and her colleagues found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30324506/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30324506/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pictures of mouths that were directed toward participants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; negatively impacted working memory. The team has also shown that mouths that are presented using CFS &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721003243" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027721003243" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enter conscious awareness faster&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if they're directed toward participants rather than away from them. This even works with abstract geometric shapes that can point toward or away from a person, such as cones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These effects aren't really just about eyes. They're more general effects of people's minds and attention being directed toward you.... We call these effects of 'mind contact,'" Colombatto says. "It's really about being the object of someone's attention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="unseen-consequences-3"&gt;Unseen consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance, then, seems to shift our social processing into high gear. "The conclusion would be that being watched drives this hardwired survival mechanism into overdrive," Seymour says. "You're in fight-or-flight mode, which is taxing on the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might today's ubiquitous electronic eyes affect our mental health? The toll could be worse for people with schizophrenia, who, Seymour's research suggests, may be &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27207190/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27207190/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hypersensitive to others' gaze&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Other conditions, such as social anxiety, also feature hypersensitivity to social cues, and that results in feelings of distress. "I'd say the modern world's constant surveillance is shifting us all in that direction, to some degree," Seymour says, "meaning we're all more attuned to our social environment and on edge, ready to react."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Panopticon, inmates always know a guard could be watching but never if one truly is. This is the key to the prison's power, argued French philosopher Michel Foucault: it becomes omniscient and internalized by the prisoners themselves. This may be why Bentham's prison feels so relevant in our digital age of algorithms, data brokers and social media, when we frequently feel watched — but we don't know who is watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This constant surveillance could tax cognition in ways that we don't yet understand. The faculties compromised by surveillance "are those that allow us to focus on what we're doing: attention, working memory, and so on," Belletier says. "If these processes are taxed by being monitored, you'd expect deteriorating capacity to concentrate." This body of research suggests that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.enhancesystems.net/tech-insight-uk-employers-ramp-up-workplace-surveillance/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.enhancesystems.net/tech-insight-uk-employers-ramp-up-workplace-surveillance/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bringing more surveillance into workplaces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — usually an attempt to boost productivity — could actually be counterproductive. It also suggests that online testing environments, where students are watched through webcams by human proctors or AI, could lead to lower performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't have as much surveillance and social connections 50 years ago, so it's a new societal context we're adapting to," Colombatto says. "It's important to think about how this is going to change our cognition, even in unconscious ways."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was first published at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-being-watched-changes-how-you-think/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-being-watched-changes-how-you-think/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. © &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/scientificamerican.com/__;!!NLFGqXoFfo8MMQ!ve-vRNHfxzMpuwnzghmp615VHAOThOfKc0RxPLCh1dx85wIiwQoA7iednip0GtnAIg1pK3FBwkmX_WffcAvtUO0%24" target="_blank" data-url="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/scientificamerican.com/__;!!NLFGqXoFfo8MMQ!ve-vRNHfxzMpuwnzghmp615VHAOThOfKc0RxPLCh1dx85wIiwQoA7iednip0GtnAIg1pK3FBwkmX_WffcAvtUO0%24" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;ScientificAmerican.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Weight loss jabs could help slash alcohol intake in obese people by around two thirds, according to a study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;It is thought the drugs help curb cravings for alcohol, experts said, although more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Weight loss jabs, also known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by reducing food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;The study, led by academics in Ireland and Saudi Arabia, included 262 obese people who had been prescribed liraglutide or semaglutide, which are available under the brand names Saxenda and Wegovy respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;They were categorised based on the amount of alcohol they consumed each week prior to starting treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="openweb-container" data-openweb-ad data-row="1" data-column="1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/having-children-later-and-being-overweight-increases-risk-of-breast-cancer/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having children later and being overweight ‘increases risk of breast cancer’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/junk-food-advertising-children-healthy-eating-uk-health/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just five minutes of exposure to junk food advertising per day makes children eat more calories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;The groups included non-drinkers, rare drinkers who had less than 10 units a week, and regular drinkers, who reported having 10 or more units each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Some 188 of the 262 patients were followed up for an average of four months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Average alcohol consumption fell from 11.3 units a week - about six or seven pints of beer - to 4.3 units a week, or roughly two pints of beer, after four months on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Among regular drinkers, intake decreased by 68%, from 23.2 units a week to 7.8 units a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Professor Carel le Roux, of University College Dublin, said: "The exact mechanism of how GLP-1 analogues reduce alcohol intake is still being investigated but it is thought to involve curbing cravings for alcohol that arise in subcortical areas of the brain that are not under conscious control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;"Thus, patients report the effects are 'effortless'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;The findings, which are being presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Malaga, suggest a "potential therapeutic role" for weight loss jabs in people who are obese and regularly drink alcohol, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;However, they stressed larger trials are needed to validate the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;Prof Le Roux added: "GLP-1 analogues have been shown treat obesity and reduce the risk of multiple obesity-related complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph-text"&gt;"Now, the beneficial effects beyond obesity, such as on alcohol intake, are being actively studied, with some promising results."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months of time-restricted eating (TRE), irrespective of whether it is earlier or later in the day, may be a promising strategy for sustaining long-term weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity, according to preliminary results of a randomised controlled trial being presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Malaga, Spain (11-14 May).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study found that restricting the eating window to 8 hours at any time of the day for 3 months can result in significant weight loss for at least a year. These benefits can be attributed to the 16-hour fasting window rather than the time of eating."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alba Camacho-Cardenosa&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;Instituto de Investigación Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.GRANADA), Granada, Spain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are well-known ways to lose weight and improve cardiometabolic health. However, long-term adherence is typically low, even among highly motivated people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TRE, which limits when, but not what people eat, is an increasingly popular intermittent fasting approach that may have greater long-term adherence and lead to better weight maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A previous randomised controlled trial by the same research team published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found that reducing the eating window from 12 hours or more to 8 hours per day decreases body weight and improves cardiometabolic health [1]. However, the impact of eating window timing on the long-term maintenance of benefits remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out more, researchers conducted a 12-month follow-up of the randomised controlled trial [1] in 99 adults with overweight or obesity (50% women; average age 49 years; average BMI: 32 kg/m²) from Granada (Spain) to investigate whether the weight loss achieved after 3 months of TRE is sustained for 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups for 12 weeks: habitual eating window of 12 hours or more; early TRE (8-hour eating window starting before 10:00); late TRE (8-hour eating window starting after 13:00); self-selected TRE (allowing participants to choose their own 8-hour eating window, which might improve adherence, acceptability, and &lt;a href="/health/What-Does-Efficacy-Mean.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;efficacy&lt;/a&gt;). All groups also took part in a Mediterranean diet education programme to encourage them to eat healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers measured body weight, waist and hip circumferences at the start of the trial, after the 12-week intervention, and 12 months after the intervention had ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 12-week intervention, the habitual eating group experienced an average weight loss of&lt;br&gt;
−1.4 kg (−1.5%). All TRE groups achieved significantly greater weight loss than the habitual eating group, with an average weight loss of −4.2 kg (−4.5%) in the early TRE group, −3.1 kg (−3.5%) in the late TRE group, and −3.8 kg (−3.9%) in the self-selected TRE group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the habitual eating group had a lower waist circumference (−1.1 cm) and hip circumference (−1.4 cm) after 12 weeks of intervention. In comparison, the early TRE group experienced significantly greater reductions in waist and hip circumferences (average −4.1 cm and −4.6 cm, respectively). The late TRE group also achieved a significant reduction in waist circumference (average −4.1 cm), but there was no significant reduction in hip circumference (average −3.2 cm). Although not statistically significant, the self-selected TRE group also achieved reductions in waist and hip circumferences (average −3.7 cm and −3.6 cm respectively)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;All TRE groups maintained greater weight loss than habitual eating at 12 months&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twelve months after the intervention ended, preliminary results reveal that the habitual eating group had an average body weight increase of 0.4 kg (+0.5%).&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Both the early TRE and the late TRE groups maintained significantly greater weight loss compared to the habitual eating group (average −2.1% [−2.2 kg] and −2.0% [−2.0 kg] respectively). Although not statistically significant, the self-selected TRE group also maintained greater body weight loss than the habitual eating group (average −0.7% [−0.7 kg]).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the habitual eating group showed an increase in waist circumference of +1.8 cm at 12 months, and a slight increase of +0.03 cm in hip circumference. In comparison, both waist and hip circumferences remained significantly lower in the late TRE group (average −5.6 cm and −3.4 cm respectively) compared with habitual eating group. Although not statistically significant, the early TRE group and self-selected TRE group also showed lower values in waist (average −0.5 cm and −1.3 cm respectively) and hip circumferences (average −1.0 cm and −1.8 cm respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, there were no significant differences between the TRE groups in any measurement, indicating that the simple 3-month lifestyle intervention may be an effective long-term approach for sustaining weight loss, irrespective of the timing of the eating window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No serious adverse events were reported during the 12-week intervention, and only five participants reported mild adverse events, all of whom chose to discontinue the intervention.Another important finding from the study was that TRE was well accepted by participants with adherence rates of 85−88%. "This kind of intermittent fasting appears feasible for adults with overweight or obesity who wish to have a relatively simple way of losing and maintaining weight loss that is less tedious and more time efficient compared with daily calorie counting, but it warrants further investigations in larger and longer-term studies," said Dr Jonatan R Ruiz, study coordinator from University of Granada, &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;nstituto de Investigación Biosanitaria de Granada (ibs.GRANADA) and Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y Nutrición (CIBEROBN) in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

In a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States, only about 14% identified their romantic partner as their best friend. While these individuals reported more companionship in their lives, others who maintained a best friend outside their romantic relationship reported greater perceived social support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to understand the role of friendship within romantic relationships and whether having a partner who is also a best friend enhances relationship quality or well-being. Drawing on the convoy model of social relations—which suggests that people navigate life with a network of supportive ties—the researchers wanted to explore how personal and situational factors influence who we call a “best friend” and how this label relates to emotional closeness, routines, and psychological outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My primary area of research is interested in friendship, and I was teaching a class where I shared an Atlantic article that asked something along the lines of, what if friendship, and not romance, was the center of our lives?” said study author &lt;a href="http://www.nataliepennington.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Natalie Pennington&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor at Colorado State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would always get really mixed reactions, and it did get me thinking about the blurry boundaries of relationships and societal expectations as we get older. I had the opportunity to reflect on that through my work with &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0305834" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The American Friendship Project&lt;/a&gt;, which is a project I co-lead that surveys connection and well-being in adults in the United States to better understand our relationships. In our datasets we keep the definition of friend quite broad, allowing people to self-identify romantic partners as a friend or as was the main focus of this study, a best friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from 940 adults in romantic relationships who also had at least one person they considered a best friend. These participants were drawn from a larger national survey on friendship and social connection conducted in 2022. They ranged in age from 18 to 85, with a median age of 41, and represented diverse backgrounds in gender, race, income, and relationship status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to list up to seven people they considered friends, without being told whether romantic partners should be included. For each person named, they could assign multiple labels such as “best friend,” “close friend,” or “romantic partner.” Additional measures assessed relationship closeness and routine interaction, as well as well-being outcomes like companionship, loneliness, stress, and social support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 36% of participants included their romantic partner in their list of friends. Of that group, 39.5% identified their partner as their best friend, translating to 14.4% of the total sample. The rest either did not list their partner at all or did not assign them the “best friend” label. Interestingly, a subset of those who called their partner a best friend also named other best friends, suggesting that these roles aren’t always exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not technically the main focus of the study, but I did think it was interesting that some people (about 25% of the sample) labeled more than one person their best friend,” Pennington told PsyPost. “Sometimes socially I think there is this feeling of ‘I can only have one best friend’ and so I liked seeing that people didn’t always adhere to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also really thought we would see more people label their best friend their romantic partner! There are not a lot of studies on this topic, but past research has been much more direct in asking “do you think your romantic partner is your best friend?” and so I wonder if part of our lower number comes from some people thinking they weren’t supposed to include their romantic partner as a friend (we didn’t tell them one way or the other). So on the one hand I think that’s one of the things that is useful with our study — you really see the unprompted potential of people saying they see their romantic partner as a friend or best friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then explored which types of people were more likely to describe their romantic partner as their best friend. They found that older adults were slightly more likely to do so, while people with higher incomes and those who were married were less likely. Gender and the number of best friends a person had were not significantly related to the likelihood of giving a partner the “best friend” title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers compared the quality of friendships depending on whether a person’s best friend was their romantic partner. Those who saw their partner as their best friend reported stronger emotional closeness and more frequent routine interaction than those whose best friend was not a partner. This suggests that combining friendship and romance may strengthen the quality of the bond—at least in the eyes of the person who holds that view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the label “best friend” didn’t seem to make a difference when applied to romantic partners already considered a friend. Among participants who named their partner as a friend, those who also labeled them as a best friend did not rate their relationship as closer or more routine than those who simply called them a “friend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the best friend relationship, we compared participants who identified a different best friend in terms of their reported closeness and routine interactions with those who said their best friend was their romantic partner,” Pennington explained. “We found that those who had a best friend that was their romantic partner reported greater closeness and routines (which makes sense, because we do often tend to invest more time and energy into a romantic relationship).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the romantic relationship, this was what spurred the title of the article — what’s in a label? Here we had compared participants who had included their romantic partner in the named friend task but did not say their partner was their best friend with those who had labeled them as a best friend, again, looking at closeness and routines. For these tests, we found no major difference between the two, signaling that calling them a ‘friend’ or ‘best friend’ are somewhat interchangeable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also wanted to know whether calling your partner your best friend was associated with better mental and emotional health. To do this, they looked at several outcomes—life satisfaction, companionship, perceived stress, loneliness, connection, disconnection, and perceived social support. They found that those who named their partner as their best friend reported greater companionship in daily life. On the other hand, those who had a separate best friend reported feeling more socially supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participants who had a best friend separate from their romantic partner reported higher levels of perceived social support,” Pennington told PsyPost. “This makes sense, because they have more people to turn to for help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participants who had a best friend that was their romantic partner reported greater feelings of companionship, which was the idea that we have someone who will go to events with us, spend time together, etc. In this case again I think this makes sense, because when we are really close with our romantic partner, we might see them as our go to person for spending time together, and perceive them as more likely to feel like they have to say yes when we ask to do something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings align with previous research suggesting that romantic partners can fulfill companionship needs, but friends might still be better positioned to offer certain types of emotional support. This may be especially true when people face challenges in their romantic relationships or when they have needs that their partner cannot meet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights how socioeconomic factors shape relationship networks. Lower-income participants were more likely to call their partner their best friend and also reported lower overall well-being. This suggests that when people have fewer resources, they may lean more heavily on a romantic partner to meet emotional needs, which can increase vulnerability if that relationship is strained. Conversely, people with higher incomes may have more time and opportunity to maintain a wider circle of close friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s results offer insight into how people conceptualize the roles of romantic partners and friends in their lives. While labeling a partner as a best friend can be associated with increased companionship, it may also come at the expense of broader support networks. Having multiple sources of connection may be more beneficial than expecting one person to meet all emotional needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study has limitations. Since it was based on self-reports from a single moment in time, it’s unclear whether having a romantic partner as a best friend leads to better companionship, or if people who already feel close and connected are simply more likely to use that label. Also, the survey prioritized friendship, so participants may not have thought to include their partner among their friends unless prompted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address these limitations by examining how relationships evolve over time and how people’s labels and behaviors shift across different life stages. Collecting data from both members of a couple could also offer richer insights into whether the view of a partner as a best friend is mutual, and whether shared perceptions improve well-being more than one-sided ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study encouraged me to think about new questions we can add to the survey going forward — thinking about, for example, gathering data about one’s romantic partner so we can make fuller comparisons,” Pennington said. “That said, our big goal with the American Friendship Project is to continue to provide insight into the state of friendship in the United States, which can include how inherently messy labeling can be — we really try with this data to show how at the end of the day it’s more about how we foster those connections through communication that matters the most. We hope to keep sharing what we learn not only through publications, but public outreach, and in the future, interventions based on our findings to help folks who may be struggling with connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the loose, big picture takeaways about this study are — invest time and energy into the people who matter, as they are the ones who can be there to help you when you’re feeling down and to celebrate your wins. I’d also say that valuing friendship in a romantic partnership is a great thing, but there is also value in investing in platonic friendships to have that fuller network to support you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251336872"&gt;What’s in a label?

Children who are routinely shamed, threatened, or belittled by adults may develop a hyperactive threat system and a blunted reward response, making trust and emotional regulation more difficult in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes affect not only emotional wellbeing but also a child’s ability to form healthy relationships and build self-worth. Experts emphasize that verbal abuse is preventable and call for greater public awareness and policy action to protect children’s mental and neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Verbal abuse overactivates threat systems and dulls reward responses in children’s brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Early verbal abuse increases risks of anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction in adulthood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventable Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Ending verbal abuse is critical for healthy brain development and long-term wellbeing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harsh words can wound – and when directed at children, they can have a lifelong impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18692174/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20483374/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; that when words are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24493840/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;routinely used&lt;/a&gt; by the adults in their lives to humiliate, shame or control children, they can alter the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-072916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of over 20,500 UK adults found that one in five reported having been verbally abused as children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitions of verbal abuse vary, but it is generally characterised by a sustained pattern of behaviour where criticism, threats or rejection of the child leads them to feel routinely belittled, blamed, threatened, frightened or ridiculed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not the same as occasionally losing your temper with your children and saying something hurtful in the heat of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I and colleagues believe this shapes how a child sees the world, others, and themselves. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673608617067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exposure to abuse&lt;/a&gt;, including verbal abuse, leads to an &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of anxiety, depression, suicide attempts and drug use in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has an impact on forming trusting relationships as an adult. Yet despite its devastating consequences, verbal abuse remains largely overlooked in public debate and policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing verbal abuse – along with all forms of child abuse and neglect – is more than just a moral imperative. It is essential for healthy brain development and lifelong wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Changes in the brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was among the experts brought together by Jessica Bondy, founder of the Words Matter charity, in the House of Commons in April 2025 to discuss the prevention of childhood verbal abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a neuroscientist, I have spent decades using brain imaging to understand how early adversity and trauma, including verbal abuse, can shape a young person’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now know that emotional abuse, including consistently hostile or demeaning language from adults, can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28295339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;significantly alter&lt;/a&gt; the way a child’s brain perceives and reacts to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several key brain systems are affected. For example, our threat system normally helps us stay safe by detecting danger and triggering a quick response – the well-known “fight or flight” reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in children subjected to frequent abuse, including verbal abuse, this system &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211011390?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;becomes hyperactive&lt;/a&gt;. Even neutral social cues – a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22258799/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;facial expression&lt;/a&gt;, or a joke or well-meaning comment – can be misinterpreted as threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal abuse also affects how children form relationships. In healthy development, warm verbal and non-verbal exchanges with caregivers – praise, compliments, thoughtful understanding – help teach children how to establish &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2920349/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;secure and healthy&lt;/a&gt; relationships. They also help them build self-worth and social confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But verbal abuse, along with other forms of childhood maltreatment, can blunt the brain’s reward system. The brain becomes less responsive to positive experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that these brain adaptations can alter how a maltreated child builds their social world. They may help the child survive in an adverse social environment, but over time they accrue long-term costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It becomes harder to trust others; harder to navigate relationships; harder to believe you are of real value and truly lovable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lifelong consequences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By adulthood, the risk is that a repeated cycle of interpersonal stress and rupture &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35926524/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;is established&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21142355/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Romantic relationships&lt;/a&gt; can be destabilised by deep-seated fears of abandonment or rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those early wounds fold into our sense of self, creating an enduring lens through which the world is perceived. It can be a struggle to feel at ease in one own’s mind, or safe in the mind of another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to my research work at UCL, I am CEO of Anna Freud, a charity dedicated to transforming mental health support through evidence-based care, cutting-edge research, professional training and accessible resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our clinical work at Anna Freud, we have seen countless young people and adults struggle with the verbal messages they have received growing up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harsh language sticks because we are biologically wired to privilege negative and threatening information for our own protection. These verbal wounds underpin so much later anxiety, pain and distress. Adults can spend decades trying to compensate to prove those words wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to shine a light on the impact of verbal abuse, helping parents, carers, teachers and all adults in a child’s life understand the power of their words. This does not imply that poor behaviour should go unchecked; children still need clear limits and honest corrective feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it does mean creating environments – at home, at school, in communities – where children are spoken to with respect, encouragement and care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbal abuse is not an inevitable part of growing up. It is preventable. And the science is clear: ending it is essential to safeguarding healthy brain development and improving life-long mental health outcomes. Society as a whole will benefit, with a new generation more likely to thrive in education and employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to ensure every child is nurtured by words that build them up, not tear them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment and verbal abuse research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/eamon-mccrory-164142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eamon McCrory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Eamon McCrory – The Conversation&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255533/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 16:06:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE9NOWFXd2RHZUl3QzZrNUVrTnB2UXM3VW13RGpkcGVfX2JFQnVKR1N0bWJNd1dtVHFGVllZTm1vLXlnOHBjdE9VTGpQSDgwZkxhYUo1MzZZLUNIVFFiVTJFS05FSHVMcmJUZ1dSYg</guid></item><item><title>5岁儿童可以使用成人大脑系统导航地图-神经科学新闻 | Five-Year-Olds Can Navigate Maps Using Adultlike Brain Systems - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE5VNG1wUEN2VUdKUFRNZ1pxYzVYZ3V4aktScTNhZm81X3FzWlMzSklWd1B6NlVsdnI2ZnYzVGJ1aldzNGtQTTc5YkIxWDlnRklnNG5UVDZnRnAzX0ZfaURlUGpTTzUwd0RjeVFaYkZ0cXhMb0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research shows that the brain region supporting map-based navigation is active in children as young as five years old. Using a child-friendly virtual environment called Tiny Town, researchers demonstrated that young children can build and mentally hold maps to guide navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans confirmed that the retrosplenial complex—a region critical for spatial mapping in adults—was already functional in these young participants. The findings challenge previous beliefs that such cognitive abilities develop only after age 12 and shed light on the early emergence of complex spatial reasoning in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Navigation Ability:&lt;/strong&gt; Five-year-olds used brain systems to navigate using mental maps.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RSC Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; The retrosplenial complex was active during map-based navigation tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual Town Test:&lt;/strong&gt; Children learned and recalled locations in a simplified digital town called Tiny Town.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Emory University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many behavioral studies suggest that using landmarks to navigate through large-scale spaces — known as map-based navigation — is not established until around age 12.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neuroscience study at Emory University counters that assumption. Through experiments combining brain scans and a virtual environment the researchers dubbed Tiny Town, they showed that five-year-olds have the brain system that supports map-based navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109783"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a child navigating a virtual city and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/child-navigation-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The Dilks lab is now doing a deeper dive into the question of how the brain develops the ability to recognize and move about the world by working on a protocol for toddlers. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt; published the finding, the first neural evidence that this cognitive ability is in place in such young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While large-scale navigation abilities certainly continue to develop throughout childhood, our findings show that the underlying neural system is established remarkably early,” says Yaelan Jung, first author of the study and a postdoctoral fellow in Emory’s Department of Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than taking a decade or more, map-based navigation is underway in half that time,” adds Daniel Dilks, associate professor of psychology and senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Five-year-olds have the brain system enabling them to find their way around a tiny, virtual town. They not only know that the ice cream store in the mountain region is different than the ice cream store in the lake region, they know how to navigate the streets to get to each of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping the visual brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilks is at the forefront of identifying specific functions of the visual cortex related to face, place and object processing — how we recognize and get around our world. He’s also pioneering methods to study the timeline for the development of these functions, from infancy to adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two fundamental questions in neuroscience,” he explains, “are how knowledge is organized in the brain and the origins of that knowledge. In other words, what knowledge are you born with and how does knowledge develop as you grow?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology of fMRI offers a window into those questions. The harmless, noninvasive technique uses a giant magnet to scan the brain and record the magnetic properties in blood. It measures heightened blood flow to a brain region, indicating that region is more active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adult studies during the past decade, the Dilks lab has showed that three scene-selective regions in the brain perform separate, non-overlapping, tasks.  The parahippocampal place area (PPA) allows us to recognize places and cluster them into categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retrosplenial complex (RSC) maps the places into their proper locations within a larger space, allowing us to navigate from one place to another. The occipital place area (OPA) allows us to walk around our immediate surroundings, not bumping into boundaries or other obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can’t fix most neurological problems right now,” Dilks says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But by continuing to learn more about how the brain develops and functions normally, we keep moving closer to being able to repair it when something goes wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking navigation versus map-based navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Dilks and Jung discovered that the brain system for walking through the immediate environment, avoiding boundaries and obstacles, does not look adultlike until age 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems counterintuitive,” Dilks says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most children can walk before the age of two. And yet the brain system helping you walk around your immediate surroundings doesn’t start appearing adultlike until relatively late.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dilks and Jung had a theory that the seemingly more complex and sophisticated abilities of map-based navigation develop earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They noted that even before they can walk well, children are carried from room-to-room and taken in strollers from place-to-place, allowing them to essentially build up a map of their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current paper, they created experimental protocols for five-year-olds to test their theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They started with a virtual town known as Neuralville, developed by the Dilks lab for an adult study. It consists of eight buildings laid out on streets surrounding a town square and oriented by the four cardinal directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests with five-year-old participants registered with the Emory Child Study Center, Jung soon learned that Neuralville was a bit too complicated for them to navigate. She simplified the paradigm, turning it into a triangle, and called it Tiny Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of cardinal directions, distinctive landscapes delineate each point of the triangle, including the mountain corner, the tree corner and the lake corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She created six structures for Tiny Town, including two each of categories generally of interest to children: ice cream stores, playgrounds and fire stations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making science fun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing experiments with child participants requires creativity and patience, Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to get at the scientific questions that we’re trying to answer,” she explains, “but it’s also important that a child who participates in a study has a good time. We want them to leave with a good impression of science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung first familiarized a child to the virtual town using the arrow keys on a computer to move through its streets and arrive at different places. She then invited the child to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was fascinating that they were so good at it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This familiarization was followed by tests of their knowledge. She showed still images of Tiny Town to a child and asked questions such as: Did you see this building in Tiny Town? Is it in the mountain corner?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the children passed this test and moved into the next phase: training for scanning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung turned the training process into a game involving the children and adult lab members. An adult would point at the child and say, “Freeze!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The kids loved it! They especially liked to freeze the adults in the room,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’d point at one of us and say, ‘It’s your turn now!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explained to the participants that the scanner was like a camera and they would need to hold perfectly still so their photo wasn’t blurry when they performed a task while in the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children were then trained to do the game-like task, pushing a button in response to paired images from Tiny Town. For instance, if an image of a particular fire station was shown with an image of mountains, they needed to push the button if this scenario mapped correctly onto Tiny Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants practiced the task in a mock scanner before entering the real one for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gave them a blanket and a pillow to make it cozy and explained that they would be watching a movie in their own private theater,” Jung says. “They really liked that idea.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting data showed that five-year-olds can learn a map and hold it in their minds. And to do so, they used their RSC — the brain region specialized for coding the location of buildings in a map, allowing us to navigate from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The icing on the cake is that everyone involved in the study — including the researchers — enjoyed the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really fun to work with the children,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned that the age of five is a magical time to scan a child. They don’t tend to be afraid of new things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dilks lab is now doing a deeper dive into the question of how the brain develops the ability to recognize and move about the world by working on a protocol for toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are proving a bigger challenge than infants and five-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Between the ages of two and three, children basically don’t listen to you,” says Jung, who is the mother of a three-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her lab mates are trying out strategies involving a cardboard mockup of a scanner, cartoons and Cheerios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s fascinating to explore how humans use different parts of the brain for complex behaviors and how that changes with age and experiences,” Jung says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re laying the groundwork for clinical applications, including getting a better understanding of typical versus atypical neural development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this navigation and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#046765766b682a676865766f4461696b767d2a616071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carol Clark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://emory.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Carol Clark – Emory University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2503569122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early development of navigationally relevant location information in the retrosplenial complex&lt;/a&gt;” by Yaelan Jung et al. &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early development of navigationally relevant location information in the retrosplenial complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representing the locations of places so that we can use them as landmarks is critical to our ability to navigate through large-scale spaces—a process referred to as “map-based navigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many neuroimaging studies in adults have revealed that this ability involves the retrosplenial complex (RSC)—a scene-selective region in the medial parietal cortex—nothing is known about how this cortical system develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, does it develop only late in childhood, as generally assumed from some behavioral studies? Or is it, perhaps counterintuitively, present in the first few years of life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this question, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) multivoxel pattern analysis and a virtual town paradigm, we investigated the representation of location information in the RSC of 5-y-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that i) the RSC in 5-y-olds already represents the locations of particular buildings in the town (e.g., the ice cream store by the mountain versus by the lake), but not their category membership (e.g., ice cream store, regardless of location), and ii) this neural representation is correlated with their performance on a location task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using multidimensional scaling, we also found that the neural representation of the buildings in RSC reflects the actual layout of the virtual town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the parahippocampal place area—a scene-selective region implicated in scene categorization, not map-based navigation—did not represent location information, but instead category information, the exact opposite of RSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings reveal the early development of navigationally relevant location information in RSC and thus the early origins of map-based navigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Rejuvenation Startup Challenge awards $2-3m to support startups with promising rejuvenation technologies. The Palo Alto longevity prize offers $1m to extend lifespan in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;All these prizes are devised to address the fact that while global life expectancy has more than doubled in the last 100 years, the quality of our health as we age has stalled. There are enormous gaps around the world between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy: in the UK, women can expect to live up to 22 years in poor health. Men live on average 17 years with chronic illness, disability or reduced quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The aim of XPrize is not to develop cutting-edge therapeutics. “The standout aim is to redefine our approach to extending the healthy, quality years of human life,” Justice said. “The winning intervention will not be disease-specific and reactive, like modern medicine. Instead, it will target the mechanisms of biological ageing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That will propel our ability to address physical and cognitive functional decline, enhance resilience in the face of illness or disease, and ultimately delay the onset of disability and death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;On Monday, the biggest prize in the longevity field comes closer as 40 semi-finalist teams are pulled from the XPrize longlist, which comprised more than 1,000 scientists, clinicians, biomedical engineers, longevity technology leaders, pharmaceutical companies, students, biohacker groups and newcomers to the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These teams – 14 of which come from the UK – have suggested a wide range of innovations including pharmacological approaches, biological therapies and lifestyle-based interventions, and often combinations of all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A common focus of solutions is to regenerate or maintain cellular and tissue function over time through biologics such as stem cell therapy. Immunotherapies and seeking to reverse age-related gene change at the molecular level are another approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New or repurposed drugs are frequently posited as solutions by the competing teams, including metformin and rapamycin, for both of which funding has long been sought to clinically prove what many hope will be a breakthrough in anti-ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Of the devices proposed, most focus on electrical stimulation of neural pathways, neuromuscular activation or muscle maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;No matter how technologically advanced the oncoming solutions, Justice says nothing will replace diet and exercise – albeit highly personalised and specific techniques – as the central element in healthy ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’re not talking about your five a day here,” she said. “While wholefoods and supplements are the most commonly proposed nutritional solutions from our teams, they’re often suggested in combination with substances like nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a naturally occurring molecule that is gaining attention as a potential anti-ageing agent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nutraceuticals – foods that offer health benefits beyond their nutritional value – also feature, with a focus on wheatgrass, seaweed, berries, proteins, amino acids, herbal products and metabolism-supporting compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lifestyle and behavioural approaches are also prominent, often combined with cognitive training, sleep optimisation and community engagement. The most frequent combinations include aerobic and resistance exercise with dietary changes, as well as sleep health paired with meditation, prayer or breathing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 15:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPd0d6M3Q3bmxBNjZaZWVPb2IzUzRhNlJ0Y21hNTZTcmRxaVp1YjBsR0k1RXFwSzdJSlV3WUpfMmxTZ0RJZ0NvU2N4X29GMEViRTNyYWRfN0NDNXE0NTJ6N3BvZlZ2cU5PV1JaWFAyRUlKUUZPT0dzenVsSFZwRFpmZUN4UEw1YVgtRWNibXo0Nm5fa0t6ZXJVS0VKYjljc1FZR0toOQ</guid></item><item><title>青少年肥胖与记忆和情绪中心的大脑变化有关-神经科学新闻 | Teen Obesity Linked to Brain Changes in Memory and Emotion Centers - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5qZDlUdnpKZk83M1lhRWlENlJjNE9TVDlSNGlwSFNwMjVtV1FlZ1FESWkyUGJ4d1hIWnBWc2ZQMUFEa1BBNDBRVERXUW5oWlBMdU5jWlo4cUN5aENBVy1vaXAwRFRnUWpPV0pRRzVCMXU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A major new study shows that adolescents with abdominal obesity have significantly larger brain regions involved in memory and emotional regulation, raising concerns about how obesity affects brain development. MRI scans revealed that the hippocampus and amygdala were enlarged in teens with obesity, especially those with high waist-to-height ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that youth from lower-opportunity neighborhoods had reduced brain development, with disparities even more pronounced among those with persistent abdominal obesity. Researchers warn that both under- and overgrowth in these brain areas may disrupt normal cognitive and emotional functioning, potentially increasing long-term risks for mental health issues and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Growth Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Obese teens had a 6.6% larger hippocampus and 4.3% larger amygdala.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The amygdala was most affected in teens with high abdominal fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Inequality:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower-opportunity environments worsened brain development outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;European Society for the Study of Obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Several areas of the brain, including regions that play a critical role in learning and memory and in the control of emotions, are larger in adolescents who are living with obesity, new research being presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025) has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding, from a study of thousands of teenagers in the US, raises concerns that obesity affects not only physical health but also learning, memory and control of emotions, says lead researcher Dr. Augusto César F. De Moraes, of UTHealth Houston School of Public Health in Austin, Department of Epidemiology, Texas, U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is particularly alarming, given that the teenage years are such an important time for brain development,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109779"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and junk food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/teen-Obesity-brain-memory-neurosciecne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Obesity—particularly abdominal obesity—has been linked to changes in brain development in the past, with regions key to cognition and the regulation of emotions seemingly particularly vulnerable. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of children and adolescents worldwide who are living with obesity more than quadrupled among girls (from 1.7% to 6.9%) and among boys (from 2.1% to 9.3%) between 1990 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, it is estimated that more than one in three children aged 5 to 14 (36.2% of boys and 37.2% of girls) are living with overweight or obesity—equating to more than 15 million children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity—particularly abdominal obesity—has been linked to changes in brain development in the past, with regions key to cognition and the regulation of emotions seemingly particularly vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health inequalities like poor access to quality education, safe neighborhoods and healthy food are well-known contributors to physical health problems—but their role in brain development and cognition is often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more about how obesity and health inequalities affect brain structure and cognition, Dr. De Moraes and colleagues in the US, Brazil, and Spain analyzed data from 3,320 participants in the ABCD study, an ongoing study into how childhood experiences affect brain development and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were recruited from cities in 17 states and followed for four years, from 2016–2018 to 2020–2022. (For list of cities, see notes to editors.) The average age of participants at baseline was 9.9 years and 47.4% were girls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were categorized based on obesity status, with further stratification by abdominal obesity (measured using waist circumference). At baseline, approximately 34.6% of participants were classified as having abdominal obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structural MRI scans assessed the volume of several brain regions of the brain’s subcortex, including the amygdala, hippocampus, caudate, accumbens, pallidum, putamen and thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health disparities were assessed using the Child Opportunity Index, which measures a child’s opportunities via the quality of neighborhood features such as education, walkability and access to healthy food and green space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of the brain regions were larger in adolescents with abdominal obesity than in their peers without abdominal obesity. The biggest changes were seen in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory and learning, and the amygdala, which regulates, or controls, emotions, including fear, happiness, anger and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus was approximately 6.6% larger and the amygdala was about 4.3% larger in teens with abdominal obesity compared to those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala was particularly large in teenagers with very high levels of abdominal fat (a waist-to-height ratio over 0.5). This raises concerns that excess body fat affects how the brain handles emotions, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus (which relays information about movement, hearing, taste, sight and touch) and caudate (which helps control movement) showed smaller increases in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that teens from lower-opportunity areas showed reduced development in key brain regions, such as the hippocampus, putamen and amygdala, compared with their peers in higher-opportunity areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This difference was even more pronounced among adolescents with persistent abdominal obesity,” says Dr. De Moraes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It highlights the urgent need to address both social inequality and health risks to support not only physical well-being but also healthy brain development in youth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors explain that in the context of the young developing brain, both decreased and increased growth can cause harm. Thus, having lower-than-normal brain development, as shown in the teens in lower-opportunity areas, or larger-than-normal parts of the brain due to inflammation caused by obesity, can both be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. De Moraes concludes, “Our findings suggest that obesity, particularly abdominal obesity, can impair teenagers’ learning, memory and control of emotions. I worry about how these changes, which are occurring at the age of 13 or 14, might affect them later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s even a chance they could be a higher risk of things like memory problems or dementia as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why we believe supporting healthier habits early on is so important, not just for physical health, but for brain health too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treating and preventing adolescent obesity won’t only improve health—it may improve brain health, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this obesity, neurodevelopment, and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://easo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Augusto César F.

              &lt;p&gt;Pap smears are a vital tool for preventing cervical cancer because they can detect cell abnormalities before they become cancerous. Unfortunately, systematic barriers or a lack of comfort with the procedure means many people aren’t receiving it. But on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/well/pap-smear-at-home-alternative-cervical.html"&gt;the FDA approved the first at-home test for cervical cancer screenings &lt;/a&gt;that is a less invasive and potentially more accessible alternative to pap smears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newly FDA-approved test was developed by San Francisco-based startup Teal Health. Like traditional pap smears, Teal Health tests for the human papillomavirus or HPV, which causes virtually all cervical cancers. However, it’s test, the Teal Wand, only requires a vaginal swab with a spongelike tool instead of inserting a speculum to scrape cells from the cervix.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a statement, Kara Egan, CEO and co-founder of Teal Health, &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/news/fda-approves-teal-healths-teal-wand-tm---the-first-and-only-at-home-self-collection-device-for-cervical-cancer-screening-introducing-a-comfortable-alternative-to-in-person-screening"&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;that the approval isn’t “just about an innovative product — it’s about finally giving women an option that makes sense for their lives — something that can be done quickly and comfortably at home.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Because when we make care easier to get, we help women stay healthy, for themselves and for the people who rely on them every day,” Egan continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html#:~:text=What%20to%20know,women%20die%20of%20this%20cancer."&gt;11,500 new cases&lt;/a&gt; of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year, and 4,000 people will die of it. However, cervical cancer could be “eradicate[d] in our lifetime,” Dr. Alexi Wright, the director of gynecologic oncology outcomes research at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, told the New York Times. “We have the tools to do it. We just don’t have comprehensive HPV vaccination or cervical cancer screening, and often can’t reach the people who are at highest risk.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the American Cancer Society, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=The%20cervical%20cancer%20death%20rate,higher%20than%20for%20White%20women."&gt;cervical cancer deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. have dropped by over half since the mid-1970s, although it has leveled off recently. One 2022 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788175#references-tab"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 23% of people were behind on their screenings in 2019 compared to 14% in 2005. Although reasons vary, one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9562154/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that lack of insurance and cost were common factors. In addition, cervical cancer rates are &lt;a href="https://hollingscancercenter.musc.edu/news/archive/2025/03/03/rural-us-counties-see-an-increase-in-cervical-cancer-rates#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20rate%20of%20cervical%20cancer,data%20between%202001%20and%202019"&gt;25% higher&lt;/a&gt; in rural areas, and the death rate is 42% higher, likely due to a lack of resources and health care providers. For some, discomfort is also a big barrier. In 2023, many participants in a Michigan Medicine study &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/medicine-michigan/end-pap-test"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that at-home kits “provide a comfortable, convenient, and flexible choice without trauma.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;At-home screenings are effective alternatives for closing the screening gap. One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31693128/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that mailing kits to people overdue for cervical cancer screenings saw a 50% increase compared to offering usual care alone. In addition, they are &lt;a href="https://permanente.org/hpv-home-testing-research-supports-better-cervical-cancer-prevention-and-screening/"&gt;just as accurate&lt;/a&gt; as clinical tests. (Teal Health also has a &lt;a href="https://www.getteal.com/research/u-s-clinical-study-demonstrates-94-of-women-prefer-at-home-cervical-cancer-screening"&gt;SELF-CERV&lt;/a&gt; study.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teal Health plans to make kits available next month, starting in California. The company is also coordinating with major insurance providers in the hope of covering costs. In addition to requesting tests through Teal Health’s platform, people can coordinate follow-up care through it if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the haze of anesthesia, some patients undergoing surgery experience something you wouldn’t expect in this tense setting — vivid, sometimes disturbing sexual fantasies. In rare but striking cases, these dreams and hallucinations have blurred the lines between reality and delusion, leaving behind confusion, distress, and in some instances, legal fallout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A growing body of literature is shedding light on an unsettling phenomenon: certain sedative and hypnotic drugs, especially those used in anesthesia, can provoke sexual hallucinations. These are not idle daydreams. They unfold with startling clarity, often in a logical sequence, and some patients recall them with an eerie sense of certainty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0.webp"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1024x683.webp" alt="A higher percentage of men interpreted the hallucinations as being pleasurable while most women often felt them like assault" class="wp-image-283314" srcset="https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1024x683.webp 1024w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-750x500.webp 750w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/assets_task_01jttpmbj2frqv015dnxj9q9yg_1746800445_img_0.webp 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A higher percentage of men interpreted the hallucinations as being pleasurable while most women often described them as assault. Image generated using Sora/ChatGPT&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-hidden-side-effect"&gt;A Hidden Side Effect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sedatives most commonly linked to these hallucinations include benzodiazepines like midazolam and diazepam, as well as propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, and even older agents like ether and chloroform. Most of these drugs act on GABA, a neurotransmitter that slows brain activity and induces relaxation — but in certain doses, they seem to open a peculiar erotic window into the subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent blog post published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-on-food/202505/several-sedative-drugs-may-give-you-sexual-fantasies"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; described &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36895011/"&gt;87 published cases&lt;/a&gt; of drug-induced sexual hallucinations. About 41% involved midazolam or diazepam, often at high doses. Patients have recounted everything from fleeting sexual dreams to distressing hallucinations of assault.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34552212/"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;of 110 dental surgery patients, 13.6% reported experiencing sexual arousal, dreams, or hallucinations during or after anesthesia. Most described them as dreams. But 10 percent reported sexual visions that were unpleasant and lingered into recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sex of the medical team appeared to matter. In a report of roughly 300 male patients undergoing urological surgery, none reported sexual dreams when the team was all male. But when a female anesthesiologist was present, at least one patient did — and declined to elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Women also reported these episodes, though differently. In a group of 130 female patients sedated with propofol and alfentanil, 12% showed amorous or disinhibited behaviors. Some patients later described these episodes as hallucinations. Others simply remembered feelings of exposure or vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-feelings-imagined-events"&gt;Real Feelings, Imagined Events&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2136615/"&gt;A study&lt;/a&gt; from 1990 documented 41 incidents of women experiencing fantasies during sedation with intravenous midazolam or diazepam. Twenty-seven involved a sexual element, and twenty were described as unpleasant. These were not vague impressions. The events “occurred in a logical sequence and all were certain of their authenticity,” the study reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here lies the disquieting twist: of 25 verified patient reports regarding occurrences during sedation, 17 turned out not to have occurred. In some of the remaining cases, the fantasies mirrored actual procedures or gestures, but with altered meanings. For instance, the pressure of a surgical swab might be reimagined as inappropriate touching.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The events felt real,” noted one researcher, “but independent witnesses confirmed they did not happen.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such hallucinations have spurred legal complaints, often against health care providers who were later found to have done nothing wrong. The study concluded that “during or following sedation, lady patients should not be treated or examined without the presence of a responsible third person.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The question remains: why do some people experience these fantasies under sedation?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-their-chemical-romance"&gt;Their Chemical Romance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers point to the drugs’ actions on neurotransmitters like GABA and dopamine. Benzodiazepines and propofol, for example, enhance GABA’s calming effects. But in high doses, these effects may disinhibit certain brain regions — allowing suppressed thoughts or emotions to surface in exaggerated or distorted forms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some dopamine-enhancing drugs, such as those used for Parkinson’s disease or ADHD, have also triggered libido surges or sexual fantasies. Antipsychotics and antidepressants — especially those altering dopamine pathways — have been implicated too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRfidJNts6U&amp;amp;pp=ygUPa2V0YW1pbmUgZHJlYW1z"&gt;Ketamine&lt;/a&gt;, a dissociative anesthetic now also used in depression treatment, has caused some patients to experience graphic or distressing sexual visions. “One patient stated she would not undergo anesthesia again if ketamine was used,” a review found. During the Vietnam War, soldiers sedated with ketamine sometimes emerged with hallucinations of sexual assault — a phenomenon known as emergent psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Importantly, men were more likely to report fantasies, and often found them pleasurable. Women, however, reported more hallucinations resembling assault, and were more likely to find them disturbing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calling-saul"&gt;Calling Saul&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For health care professionals, these findings carry both clinical and ethical implications. The hallucinations, while rare, are vivid and potentially traumatizing. Some patients, believing the visions were real, have discontinued care or filed complaints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Although such sexual hallucinations and fantasies are rare, the vivid recollection of the patient’s experiences should be recognized and acknowledged,” the review warned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts now recommend that clinicians inform patients — especially those receiving high-dose sedatives — that such hallucinations are possible. They also urge protective protocols, like ensuring a witness is present, or using video monitoring, particularly during sensitive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if the events never happened, the emotional scars can be real.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One woman, after receiving sufentanil, propofol, and midazolam for a routine procedure, described a compelling urge to show the medical team a private tattoo — a hallucination she later found deeply distressing. Though no one had touched her inappropriately, the sense of violation lingered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As powerful as they are, sedatives don’t just quiet the mind — they sometimes unmoor it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, these drugs have made invasive procedures less painful and more bearable. Midazolam and diazepam, in particular, are considered among the safest short-term sedatives in medicine. But safety isn’t everything. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What happens under sedation may stay in the mind long after the drugs have worn off.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some events,” as the 1990 paper put it, “are very real to the patient — and yet, on the evidence of two or more independent witnesses, did not occur.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That contradiction makes these hallucinations especially thorny (I said thorny). The memories may be false, but the emotions they carry are not. And in medicine, that distinction matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This mutation affects the sleep-wake cycle, leading to less sleep and potentially more deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors usually recommend at least seven to nine hours of sleep each night, with sleep deprivation in individuals linked to conditions such as Alzheimer's and heart disease.

These people [natural short sleepers], all these functions our bodies are doing while we are sleeping, they can just perform at a higher level than we can," study co-author Ying-Hui Fu, a neuroscientist and geneticist at the University of California, was quoted as saying by&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/rare-genetic-mutation-lets-some-people-thrive-on-just-4-hours-of-shut-eye" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;em&gt; LiveScience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified one of these mutations, named SIK3-N783Y, in a human super-sleeper. Afterwards, the team studied the mutation in genetically modified mice and found that the rodent also got less sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that mice with the mutation slept around 31 minutes less than those without it, and 54 minutes less following a period of sleep deprivation, which was induced through gentle handling of the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a mouse model, the presence of the NSS hSIK3-N783Y mutation leads to a decrease in sleep time and an increase in EEG delta power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/man-dumps-girlfriend-after-her-phone-automatically-connects-to-hotel-wi-fi-8387664" rel="noindex,nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Read | Man Dumps Girlfriend After Her Phone Automatically Connects To Hotel Wi-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists added that the mutation caused structural changes affecting the protein's ability to transfer key phosphate molecules to other proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research said the study findings could lead to new therapies for sleep disorders and improve sleep quality in individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Further data analyses reveal additional kinases that could participate in the modulating network for sleep duration."&lt;/p&gt;

In mice, researchers found “goal-progress cells” that fire based on how far along the animal is in a behavioral task, enabling them to infer what comes next even in novel scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells create internal maps of behavior rather than physical environments, allowing for flexible, generalised thinking. The discovery sheds light on how the brain supports everyday problem-solving and may inform future advances in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal-Progress Cells:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons in the cortex track behavioral sequences, not spatial position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Memory:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice inferred task structure without prior exposure, showing true generalization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological AI Bridge:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings help connect brain function to adaptable AI systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;The Conversation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For decades, neuroscientists have developed mathematical frameworks to explain how brain activity drives behaviour in predictable, repetitive scenarios, such as while playing a game. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These algorithms have not only described brain cell activity &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627320304682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with remarkable precision&lt;/a&gt; but also helped develop artificial intelligence with superhuman achievements in specific tasks, such as playing Atari or Go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109775"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuron-prediction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The behaviour we compose to reach our goals is replete with repetition. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet these frameworks fall short of capturing the essence of human and animal behaviour: our extraordinary ability to generalise, infer and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08145-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; late last year, provides insights into how brain cells in mice enable this more complex, intelligent behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike machines, humans and animals can flexibly navigate new challenges. Every day, we solve new problems by generalising from our knowledge or drawing from our experiences. We cook new recipes, meet new people, take a new path – and we can imagine the aftermath of entirely novel choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in the mid-20th century that psychologist Edward Tolman described &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1949-00103-001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the concept of “cognitive maps”&lt;/a&gt;. These are internal, mental representations of the world that organise our experiences and allow us to predict what we’ll see next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1970s, researchers identified &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0006899371903581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a beautiful system of specialised cells&lt;/a&gt; in the hippocampus (the brain’s memory centre) and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;entorhinal cortex&lt;/a&gt; (an area that deals with memory, navigation, and time perception) in rodents that form a literal map of our environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include “place cells”, which fire at specific locations, and “grid cells” that create a spatial framework. Together, these and a host of other neurons encode distances, goals and locations, forming a precise mental map of the physical world and where we are within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now our attention has turned to other areas of cognition beyond finding our way around generalisation, inference, imagination, social cognition and memory. The same areas of the brain that help us navigate in space are also involved in these functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cells for generalising?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know if there are cells that organise the knowledge of our behaviour, rather than the outside world, and how they work. Specifically, what are the algorithms that underlie the activity of brain cells as we generalise from past experience? How do we rustle up that new pasta dish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we did find such cells. There are neurons that tell us “where we are” in a sequence of behaviour (we haven’t named the cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To uncover the brain cells, networks and algorithms that perform these roles, we studied mice, training the animals to complete a task. The task had a sequence of actions with a repeating structure. Mice moved through four locations, or “goals”, containing a water reward (A, B, C and D) in loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we moved the location of the goals, the mice were able to infer what came next in the sequence – even when they had never experienced that exact scenario before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mice reached goal D in a new location for the first time, they immediately knew to return to goal A. This wasn’t memory, because they’d never encountered it. Instead, it shows that the mice understood the general structure of the task and tracked their position within it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice had electrodes implanted into the brain, which allowed us to capture neural activity during the task. We found that specific cells in the cortex (the outermost layer of the brain) collectively mapped the animal’s goal progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, one cell could fire when the animal was 70% of the way to its goal, regardless of where the goal was or how far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cells tracked progress towards immediate subgoals – like chopping vegetables in our cooking analogy – while others mapped progress towards the overall goal, such as finishing the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these goal progress cells created a system that gave our location in behavioural space rather than a physical space. Crucially, the system is flexible and can be updated if the task changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This encoding allows the brain to predict the upcoming sequence of actions without relying on simple associative memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Common experiences&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why should the brain bother to learn general structural representations of tasks? Why not create a new representation for each one? For generalisation to be worthwhile, the tasks we complete must contain regularities that can be exploited — and they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behaviour we compose to reach our goals is replete with repetition. Generalisation allows knowledge to extend beyond individual instances. Throughout life, we encounter a highly structured distribution of tasks. And each day we solve new problems by generalising from past experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous encounter with making bolognese can inform a new ragu recipe, because the same general steps apply to both (such as starting with frying onions and adding fresh herbs at the end).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that the goal-progress cells in the cortex serve as the building blocks – internal frameworks that organise abstract relationships between events, actions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we’ve only shown this in mice, it is plausible that the same thing happens in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By documenting these cellular networks and the algorithms that underlie them, we are building new bridges between human and animal neuroscience, and between biological and artificial intelligence.

A wealth of findings is beginning to reveal the algorithms that we use to map the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the biological algorithms that map the complex structured behaviours that we compose to reach our goals remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we reveal a neuronal implementation of an algorithm for mapping abstract behavioural structure and transferring it to new scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We trained mice on many tasks that shared a common structure (organizing a sequence of goals) but differed in the specific goal locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mice discovered the underlying task structure, enabling zero-shot inferences on the first trial of new tasks. The activity of most neurons in the medial frontal cortex tiled progress to goal, akin to how place cells map physical space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These ‘goal-progress cells’ generalized, stretching and compressing their tiling to accommodate different goal distances. By contrast, progress along the overall sequence of goals was not encoded explicitly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, a subset of goal-progress cells was further tuned such that individual neurons fired with a fixed task lag from a particular behavioural step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these cells acted as task-structured memory buffers, implementing an algorithm that instantaneously encoded the entire sequence of future behavioural steps, and whose dynamics automatically computed the appropriate action at each step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These dynamics mirrored the abstract task structure both on-task and during offline sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that schemata of complex behavioural structures can be generated by sculpting progress-to-goal tuning into task-structured buffers of individual behavioural steps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/254233/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 14:24:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE9XcGZqdXdLY3BwaUZab3B3UU41RER3ZnpWbTRBNERwTkh3c2tzd3RPcGRveUFjTWZoYkVDN1ZMbFlLdDNfOUVTbmMzQXVzQnZTZ0F6d2JCODJZdGZoUUdxeWhqenJXRTE3eXhzTHE0SEZ1b2RlNlE</guid></item><item><title>与社交焦虑相关的大脑节奏可以解释为什么错误会徘徊在记忆中- PsyPost | Brain rhythms tied to social anxiety may explain why mistakes linger in memory - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNVmxMU3JJT2hUMkJuSnJvcG9uMHhqQm5PSlR0ZzBCWlVWdVduTlNheTNhVHFGWXJDeEQzNDJiWkhMQUQ4cm44Q2N2X1dSMVZ3ckxwZGh0S0dIdnlsNFRPQ2t5blpkYkJFZUlCMnhSdXBDaFVnMGJsSGVFakZuTXFhZHBzQ1BaWXV6LTE3RmJxWnhLMzJaY3JsZVNtc1pOdEc5NUd1YV9R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with higher levels of social anxiety are more likely to remember faces they saw while making mistakes, and this may be due to how their brains respond to errors in the moment. A new study published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3758/s13415-024-01198-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cognitive, Affective, &amp;amp; Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that social anxiety is linked to enhanced neural activity in the brain’s monitoring system during errors, which in turn predicts stronger memory for those moments. This finding could help explain why social anxiety persists over time and may eventually guide more targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the study sought to better understand how social anxiety affects the way people process and remember social situations. According to psychological models, individuals with social anxiety tend to focus more on their own mistakes and perceived flaws in social settings. This heightened self-focus can lead to biased memories, where negative moments are more likely to be remembered than positive or neutral ones. These memory biases can reinforce anxious beliefs and behaviors, creating a cycle that maintains or worsens social anxiety over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous research has shown that people with social anxiety exhibit stronger brain responses to errors, it remained unclear whether those neural responses had any lasting impact—such as changing how people remember what happened during social mistakes. The goal of the new study was to test whether brain activity related to error monitoring could help explain the memory biases seen in socially anxious individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My interest started when I was doing clinical rotations as an undergraduate. There, I saw that the usual treatments didn’t always work well for complicated brain problems. This made me want to use brain imaging to understand the brain better,” said study author Kianoosh Hosseini Ghalebin, a cognitive neuroscience PhD candidate at Florida International University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My path led me to pursue a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience at Florida International University (FIU), working with &lt;a href="https://www.ndclab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. George Buzzell&lt;/a&gt; and the Neural Dynamics of Control Laboratory, within the &lt;a href="https://ccf.fiu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Center for Children and Families (CCF)&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I got further into my PhD work, I became really interested in neural oscillations, which are like the brain’s electrical rhythms,” Hosseini explained. “I liked them because they offer a direct way to see what the brain is doing while it’s happening. These rhythms don’t just reflect ongoing brain activity; they can also be manipulated externally. For instance, stimulating specific brain regions at particular frequencies can alter cognitive functions and related behaviors. This ability to both measure and change brain activity makes these rhythms a powerful tool for understanding why complex conditions arise in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Building on this, I became especially interested in social anxiety, given its high prevalence and the persistent challenge it poses for treatment. Cognitive models suggest that biased thinking and memory—especially focusing on and remembering mistakes—are key reasons why social anxiety lasts. Meanwhile, brain research has found different brain activity in people with social anxiety, like their brain being extra sensitive to mistakes (i.e., enhanced error monitoring) in a part called the mediofrontal cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working together with Drs. Buzzell, Pettit, and Mattfeld at FIU/CCF, we saw a good opportunity to connect these two ideas—enhanced error monitoring and biased thinking and memory in individuals with social anxiety—by using neural oscillations, particularly the theta rhythms recorded over the mediofrontal cortex, as a way to observe in real time the brain activity that might be causing these cognitive biases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research is based on the idea that this enhanced error monitoring, reflected in these oscillations, could lead to people remembering negative social events more strongly and in a biased way,” Hosseini continued. “This mechanism might help explain why social anxiety is so persistent. Ultimately, identifying such concrete neural mechanisms could pave the way for more targeted and effective interventions, moving beyond symptom descriptions to directly address the underlying brain processes that maintain social anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the researchers developed a novel experimental task called the Face-Flanker task. Participants completed this task while their brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). The task was designed to simulate a socially evaluative situation: participants were told their performance would be observed and judged, and each trial featured a unique face image in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During each trial, participants saw an array of five arrows and had to respond to the direction of the center arrow while ignoring the others. The background included a face from a diverse database of neutral expressions. The task was structured to induce mistakes, especially on trials where the surrounding arrows pointed in the opposite direction from the center arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the task, participants were given an unexpected memory test. They were shown a mix of faces—some they had seen during the task and some they had not—and asked to identify which ones were familiar. This allowed the researchers to assess whether participants were more likely to remember faces that had appeared during error trials compared to correct ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-four adults initially took part in the study, but after excluding those who made too few mistakes or had unusable data, the final behavioral analysis included 32 participants. Of these, 24 participants had EEG recordings suitable for analyzing brain activity. Participants also completed a self-report questionnaire measuring social anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a specific type of brain activity known as theta oscillations, particularly those originating in the medial frontal cortex—a region known to play a key role in monitoring errors. They analyzed both the power (strength) and synchrony (timing consistency) of these brain signals. They also examined how strongly the medial frontal cortex synchronized with sensory areas of the brain, especially those involved in processing visual information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a consistent pattern. People with higher levels of social anxiety showed stronger synchronization of theta waves in the medial frontal cortex and between that region and visual sensory areas during errors. This enhanced brain synchrony was not present during correct responses, suggesting it was specific to error processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A couple of our findings were particularly interesting,” Hosseini told PsyPost. “What stood out was the specific nature of the brain activity linked to social anxiety symptoms. Instead of just seeing a general increase in the strength (power) of error-related theta brain waves, we found that higher social anxiety was specifically associated with the synchrony—the coordinated timing—of these waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was evident both within the mediofrontal cortex (MFC), a key region for error processing, and notably, in the communication between the MFC and sensory (visual) processing areas. This finding provides a more nuanced picture than simply concluding that social anxiety involves generally increased error monitoring. It suggests a specific mechanism involving potentially altered communication between error detection and sensory processing regions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, social anxiety symptoms were also associated with a memory bias: individuals with higher anxiety were more likely to recognize faces that had appeared during their mistakes. This was true even though, on average, the group as a whole did not show a significant memory difference between error and correct trials. The memory bias was more pronounced in those whose brains showed the strongest synchronization between the frontal and sensory regions during mistakes. In other words, the more their brain circuits responded to errors, the more likely they were to remember the faces they saw during those moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding provides a potential explanation for why social anxiety persists. If people with social anxiety are more likely to remember their social errors—and this is linked to how their brains respond to mistakes—it could lead to a distorted self-image over time. They may replay negative social memories more often, fueling worry and avoidance in future interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research highlights two key findings regarding individuals with higher social anxiety symptoms,” Hosseini said. “First, they demonstrate heightened brain activity when registering their own mistakes, reflecting more intensive error monitoring. Second, they show an enhanced ability to recall contextual details that were present when those errors occurred, even without actively trying to memorize them. This combination points toward a potential brain mechanism contributing to social anxiety: the act of monitoring errors more intensely may inadvertently strengthen the memory trace for associated information present during those moments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Building on this, our more recent (unpublished) research adds a layer of specificity: this memory bias appears selective for social information. We found that higher social anxiety predicted better memory specifically for faces present during errors, but showed no such relationship for non-social objects present during errors. This distinction is significant; it implies the underlying mechanism isn’t simply a general memory boost around errors for anxious individuals, but is specifically tuned to enhance the encoding of social cues during mistakes. This provides a more direct potential pathway linking error processing biases to the maintenance of social anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that their task allowed them to isolate the effect of error-related brain activity on memory formation in a way that past studies could not. Because each trial used a unique face and was followed by a surprise memory test, the researchers could more precisely link neural activity at the time of the error to later memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study has some limitations. It included a relatively small number of participants, and most were young adults, predominantly female and Hispanic, from a university population. These factors limit how broadly the findings can be generalized. Also, while the results show a link between brain responses to errors and memory biases, they cannot prove causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a proof-of-concept study with a relatively small sample size, primarily undergraduate students, so the findings need replication in larger, more diverse groups,” Hosseini noted. “Also, our study design is correlational, meaning we can show associations between error monitoring, incidental memory bias, and social anxiety, but we cannot definitively prove causation—such as that social anxiety results in enhanced error monitoring, which then causes a memory bias that maintains social anxiety. Longitudinal studies and methods that can probe causality are needed to track these factors over time and better understand the causal relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore how these brain-based memory biases interact with other aspects of social anxiety, such as rumination after social events. It is also important to investigate whether similar patterns emerge with different types of memory, like intentional recall or emotional memory, and whether this brain activity is specific to social stimuli or occurs with other types of mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that identifying how brain signals shape memory in social anxiety could help inform new interventions. For instance, non-invasive brain stimulation might be used to modify the neural circuits involved in error processing, potentially reducing the lasting impact of social mistakes on memory and self-perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our ultimate goal is to identify concrete neural mechanisms involved in social anxiety, such as the oscillatory dynamics linking error monitoring and memory bias,” Hosseini said. “Determining these mechanisms is important because it could eventually inform the development of targeted and effective treatments, potentially through causal interventions like non-invasive brain stimulation aimed at modulating the specific neural circuits identified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Building on our current findings, we plan to use longitudinal studies to determine if this link between error monitoring and memory bias prospectively predicts changes in social anxiety symptoms over time. Furthermore, we hope to investigate how these error- and memory-related processes interact with other key features of social anxiety, such as post-event rumination, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the disorder’s neurocognitive underpinnings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finally, I would like to acknowledge the invaluable support from the Center for Children and Families (CCF) at Florida International University and express my sincere gratitude to my co-authors, Jeremy W.

These components have caught attention for their potential to aid normal nerve functioning in older adults. They may also help ease oxidative damage in brain tissue by scavenging free radicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fungal-diseases-that-infect-humans-are-becoming-more-common-in-warming-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fungal extracts&lt;/a&gt; appear to reduce harmful inflammation. That matters because chronic inflammatory reactions in the brain can lead to diminished thinking skills and worsen certain diseases of the nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By restraining the overproduction of pro-inflammatory substances, fungi may help maintain a steadier internal environment for nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-aging-populations-raise-the-stakes"&gt;How aging populations raise the stakes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people live longer, the number of those affected by diseases of the nervous system is expected to rise sharply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is one of the biggest risk factors for conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/17-year-old-man-breaks-the-world-record-for-early-onset-alzheimers-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pesticide-exposure-increases-the-risk-of-parkinsons-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parkinson’s&lt;/a&gt;, which makes prevention and early support more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This current trend is pushing scientists to find solutions that don’t rely solely on synthetic drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many older adults prefer natural options with fewer side effects, and medicinal mushrooms could offer one such path if their benefits continue to be confirmed through research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-these-fungi-stand-out"&gt;Why these fungi stand out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern pharmaceuticals for diseases of the nervous system often work on specific symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they don’t always slow the actual progression of conditions like Alzheimer’s. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5987239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientists&lt;/a&gt; suspect some mushrooms could do more than manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early findings hint at better antioxidant protection and improved cellular cleanup processes, which are vital for the brain’s long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31460832/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; also note that certain fungi support a balanced &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gut-bacteria-influence-our-social-behavior-and-sense-of-fairness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;intestinal microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. The microbiome influences health beyond digestion by affecting how the body regulates mood, memory, and inflammatory signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A healthy gut environment often aligns with greater mental sharpness, which is why the microbiome has turned into a hotspot for brain-related research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-research-shaping-potential-therapies"&gt;Research shaping potential therapies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extracts of species such as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92757/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have drawn a lot of interest for their neuroprotective properties. They appear to regulate immune cell activity in ways that safeguard fragile neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, compounds from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667142523000143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cordyceps militaris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seem promising in stroke and Parkinson’s models, possibly due to their ability to moderate excessive inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests in laboratory models indicate these mushrooms can be gentle on the body. When used with standard treatments, they might help patients manage symptoms while protecting nerve cells against oxidative harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts are now underway to transform these natural agents into standardized preparations that could be easier for people to incorporate into daily regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-lab-results-into-real-solutions"&gt;Turning lab results into real solutions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical researchers are still exploring which precise compounds in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-species-of-glowing-mushrooms-discovered-mycena-crocata/"&gt;mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; can cross the blood-brain barrier. That information matters for designing targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get there, advanced tools like mass spectrometry and molecular modeling are helping identify the relevant components. After verifying safety and purity, scientists will need to track long-term outcomes in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical and food industries are keen to develop mushroom-based products that are convenient to consume. Capsules, powders, and functional beverages could all become options in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these ideas are still in development, initial patents and prototypes have started to appear, reflecting the potential for more widespread use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exploring-safety-and-public-trust"&gt;Exploring safety and public trust&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before mushroom-based therapies can gain traction, people want to know they’re safe. Although many of these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hundreds-of-fungi-species-are-threatened-with-extinction/"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; have been consumed for centuries in traditional medicine, formal clinical testing is needed to confirm their safety in concentrated forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are calling for long-term toxicity studies and more trials in diverse human populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would help build public trust and ease the concerns of doctors and health regulators who are cautious about introducing natural compounds without thorough vetting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-hopes"&gt;Challenges and hopes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people worry about taking unregulated supplements, and that is where standards come in. Researchers and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-twenties-can-make-or-break-your-heart-health/"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; agencies alike stress the importance of careful quality checks, especially as more individuals look to nontraditional therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By setting guidelines for dosage and composition, consumers could gain safer access to these mushrooms’ useful attributes. Coordinated efforts will likely speed progress in this field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists from multiple disciplines are combining laboratory data with patient observations to make sure any mushroom-based approach is both reliable and backed by evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This blend of natural wisdom and modern science might yield new ways to manage conditions that have stumped clinicians for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1750-3841.70230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Food Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 13:49:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQM2lRdWlCRWdHZjhhRDFTd3ZoQ1hJQ1VTTk5yV0tMck1tMmpRaDdjLTF4M0ZnZTc4NU9FeVNxcmhrQldqYmdENVNQYnhBM3A0Qy1DdlpyNTJ6YUwzYXdUOXlKakJxRHJzVW42dmt2ejZOU1dacWZEcm92dE9TQmwyMmNnYTgzU1cwYU9tN0JSU3E1SW1rR2E1R3RkOS1feGx6RUd4NE8teEk0SHlHQjdzMU0wUTJyQQ</guid></item><item><title>三个不眠之夜可能会伤害你的心脏-神经科学新闻 | Three Sleepless Nights May Harm Your Heart - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOdGdZSXdwN0hOTnpPUHBVRFozNTVzbHMwaTRpZDQtZEN6c0xVX1dkMzlOeHhhejNpbjRBTXZMRHlZeHVPeUlzSW56a0VRbml0WWFrZElERjBTNWh1VTI0cXdlSW1qWUJscDJYdi1TdkFrazdNU2J4YVpFTUp1VXlyODBB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that even short-term sleep deprivation activates inflammatory proteins in the blood linked to cardiovascular disease. After just three nights of sleeping four hours per night, healthy young men showed increased levels of proteins associated with heart failure and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While exercise still triggered beneficial proteins, the heart may face greater strain when sleep is lacking. These findings highlight the critical role of sleep in heart health, even in otherwise healthy individuals, and suggest that sleep and exercise should be viewed as complementary, not interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Just 3 nights of poor sleep elevated inflammation-related proteins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart risk markers increased even in young, healthy individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Helps, But Not Enough:&lt;/strong&gt; Physical activity can’t fully offset sleep loss effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even a few nights with insufficient sleep promote molecular mechanisms linked to a greater risk of heart problems. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been shown in a new study in which the researchers investigated how sleep deprivation affects biomarkers (in this case proteins) associated with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led from Uppsala University and is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Biomarker Research&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109768"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a person sleeping and a heart." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-deprivation-cardiovascular-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers have previously shown that exercise in the presence of sleep deprivation can result in a slightly increased load on the heart’s muscle cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, nearly half of all Swedes regularly experience disturbed sleep, and this is particularly common among shift workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is why we wanted to try to identify mechanisms that affect how lack of sleep can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Ultimately, the purpose was to identify opportunities to address these problems,” says Jonathan Cedernaes, physician and docent at Uppsala University, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chronic lack of sleep is a growing public health problem and in large population studies it has been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart health is influenced by several lifestyle factors, including sleep, diet and exercise. In order to separate out the effects of sleep, a number of conditions were controlled in the laboratory environment such as diet and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the study was conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors studied 16 healthy young men of normal weight. They all had healthy sleep habits. The participants spent time in a sleep laboratory where their meals and activity levels were strictly controlled in two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one session, participants got a normal amount of sleep for three consecutive nights, while during the other session, they got only about four hours of sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During both sessions, morning and evening blood samples were taken, and following high-intensity exercise lasting 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflammatory proteins increased after sleep loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers measured the levels of around 90 proteins in the blood and were able to see that the levels of many of these that are associated with increased inflammation rose when the participants were sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these proteins have already been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease such as heart failure and coronary artery disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many of the larger studies that have been done on the link between sleep deprivation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases have generally focused on slightly older individuals who already have an increased risk of such diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is why it was interesting that the levels of these proteins increased in the same way in younger and previously perfectly healthy individuals after only a few nights of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This means that it’s important to emphasise the importance of sleep for cardiovascular health even early in life,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effects of exercise can be affected by lack of sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical exercise generated a slightly different response after lack of sleep. However, a number of key proteins increased equally, whether the person was sleep-deprived or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, proteins that can be linked to the positive effects of exercise increased, even if the person had too little sleep. The researchers have previously shown that exercise in the presence of sleep deprivation can result in a slightly increased load on the heart’s muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we have improved our understanding of what role the amount of sleep we get plays in cardiovascular health. It’s important to point out that studies have also shown that physical exercise can offset at least some of the negative effects that poor sleep can cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s also important to note that exercise cannot replace the essential functions of sleep,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further research is needed to investigate how these effects might differ in women, older individuals, patients with heart disease, or those with different sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our ongoing research will hopefully help to develop better guidelines on how sleep, exercise and other lifestyle factors can be harnessed to better prevent cardiovascular diseases,” says Jonathan Cedernaes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was carried out in collaboration with researchers at Akershus University Hospital and Sahlgrenska University Hospital, and was supported by the Swedish Society for Medical Research (SSMF), the Göran Gustafsson Foundation, the Swedish Diabetes Foundation, and &lt;em&gt;Hjärnfonden&lt;/em&gt; (the Swedish Brain Foundation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and cardiovascular disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6401080d0a4a0605070f1710160b092411114a1701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elin Bäckström&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uu.se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elin Bäckström – Uppsala University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40364-025-00776-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Overlooked Trio: Sleep Duration, Sampling Time and Physical Exercise Alter Levels of Olink-Assessed Blood Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Risk&lt;/a&gt;” by Jonathan Cedernaes et al. &lt;em&gt;Biomarker Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overlooked Trio: Sleep Duration, Sampling Time and Physical Exercise Alter Levels of Olink-Assessed Blood Biomarkers of Cardiovascular Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomarker profiling from biofluids such as blood are widely measured in clinical research, using for example Olink proteomics panels. One such research focus area is cardiovascular disease (CVD), for which chronic sleep restriction (SR) is a risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it remains unclear whether blood levels of commonly measured CVD biomarkers are sensitive to acute dynamic factors such as SR, physical exercise (PEx), and time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this crossover design, 16 normal-weight, healthy men underwent three highly standardized in-lab nights of SR (4.25 h/night) and normal sleep (NS, 8.5 h/night) in randomized order, with 88 CVD blood protein biomarkers quantified using the Olink technology (and selected validation using ELISA) in the morning, evening, and immediately before and repeatedly after 30 min of high-intensity exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found significant time-of-day-dependent changes in several CVD biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas several proteins were exercise-induced across sleep conditions (such as the canonical exerkines IL- 6 and BDNF), exercise-induced proteomic dynamics differed in response to recurrent SR, compared with following NS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, SR compared with NS resulted in a biomarker profile previously associated with increased prospective risk of several CVDs across large-scale cohorts (such as higher circulating levels of IL-27 and LGALS9). Our findings highlight how dynamic physiology can modulate CVD biomarker levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results also underscore the need to consider sleep duration as a key determinant of cardiovascular health—an emphasis reflected in recent American Heart Association guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies in women, older individuals, and patients with prior CVD, and across different chronotypes and dietary schedules are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 13:27:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOdGdZSXdwN0hOTnpPUHBVRFozNTVzbHMwaTRpZDQtZEN6c0xVX1dkMzlOeHhhejNpbjRBTXZMRHlZeHVPeUlzSW56a0VRbml0WWFrZElERjBTNWh1VTI0cXdlSW1qWUJscDJYdi1TdkFrazdNU2J4YVpFTUp1VXlyODBB</guid></item><item><title>高胆固醇的一个微妙症状会影响眼睛- Surrey Live | One subtle symptom of high cholesterol can affect the eyes - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPN0puMEQ1aFQ1dUF2QmtqZGQ1ek91dDg0em1NZlgzSTNVMHdsNm9VTTA0c09KdDJXYmw1eW9vQVFJSGphdE1xV2ZjcWp0WVV6YzJUU2tGMzFUNGdISDhhU1Rxa0dPanVtdVBqRndiQS1nSEduVHFrV20tTGxTd2NHbDB5ekJ3SExrcDRWRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood that is essential for building cells and producing hormones.

However, there are some visible warning signs that people may ignore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31617251" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Dave said: "Severe cases can cause chest pain or symptoms of a heart attack or stroke. Less commonly, yellowish deposits around the eyes (xanthelasma) or fatty bumps on the skin (xanthomas) may appear."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Danish study involving more than 10,000 participants found that individuals with xanthelasma had a higher risk of coronary heart disease and heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High cholesterol can also greatly increase the risk of a stroke, with the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Stroke Association &lt;/a&gt;reporting that the condition can increase the risk by 10 per cent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In light of Stroke Awareness Month this May, Dr Dave noted: “Imbalanced cholesterol levels significantly increase the risk of stroke by damaging and obstructing blood vessels that supply the brain. High levels of bad cholesterol contribute to the buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) in the arteries, and these plaques can narrow or block blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the brain.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;British Heart Foundation&lt;/a&gt; identifies corneal arcus as another eye-related symptom that people with high cholesterol, caused by inherited factors, may experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31617252" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;High cholesterol can also greatly increase the risk of a stroke, by around 10 per cent&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), is an inherited condition, meaning you were born with it. It is often passed through families in faulty genes and can cause high cholesterol levels, regardless of other risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Corneal arcus is a pale white ring around the coloured part of your eye, your iris.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the BHF noted that these symptoms are often overlooked as there are usually “no symptoms of high cholesterol”. It warned: “Left untreated, high cholesterols can lead to heart attack and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How to tell if you have high cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The NHS advises people to book in for a blood test if they are concerned about high cholesterol or have any unusual symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This test can be done at a GP surgery and measures:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total cholesterol – the overall amount of cholesterol in your blood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good cholesterol (called HDL) – This may make you less likely to have heart problems or a stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-HDL (bad) cholesterol – the difference between total cholesterol and HDL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health professionals will consider factors such as your age, blood pressure and health conditions to determine whether you have “healthy” cholesterol levels. Combined, these measures determine your risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the UK, people aged 40 and over are encouraged to have their cholesterol levels measured every five years as part of free NHS health checks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How to lower cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31617257" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;span class="caption" itemprop="description"&gt;A heart-healthy diet can manage cholesterol levels&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many simple ways to manage your cholesterol levels from home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Adopt a heart-healthy diet&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Dave recommends focusing on foods rich in fibre (like oats, legumes, fruits, and vegetables) and healthy fats (like those in nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish). Cut back on saturated fats, trans fats, and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Exercise regularly&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity (like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming) most days of the week to boost HDL (good cholesterol) and lower LDL (bad cholesterol).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Maintain a healthy weight&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Losing even a small amount of weight can improve cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h5&gt;Quit smoking and limit alcohol&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smoking lowers good cholesterol and damages blood vessels. Excessive alcohol can raise cholesterol and triglyceride levels, so moderation is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 13:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxPN0puMEQ1aFQ1dUF2QmtqZGQ1ek91dDg0em1NZlgzSTNVMHdsNm9VTTA0c09KdDJXYmw1eW9vQVFJSGphdE1xV2ZjcWp0WVV6YzJUU2tGMzFUNGdISDhhU1Rxa0dPanVtdVBqRndiQS1nSEduVHFrV20tTGxTd2NHbDB5ekJ3SExrcDRWRA</guid></item><item><title>揭开RFK Jr.关于疫苗的“双峰” --《华盛顿邮报》 | Unpacking RFK Jr.’s ‘doublespeak’ on vaccines - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxOX0Q1bi1OcG1TNzJtakdvcXNhODhBSENfV24zTmEzYktwTjNIVFhTRHcweDNHdngwZlFHYjljN1NZekZLLVhMMzVDT1ZsamtmZHRVRGZNUDBDQzRzcXpQXzdueWpFRnYyblBrN25JSkVQU1ItUnUwM0FMZVBWY3piRTNSdTBtMzA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P815M6WYXH3BZ33GZQMH9B5HXC" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Early last month, after two Texas children had died &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;of measles&lt;/a&gt;, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged that the MMR vaccine prevents the spread of that virus.

His “doublespeak,” as public health experts and academics who follow the anti-vaccine movement&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;call it, gives him cover with both groups, allowing him to court public opinion while still assuaging his anti-vaccine base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="0E7NKXWG8H71KDGKN3Y8PTW6HW" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At least half of adults are uncertain whether to believe&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;false claims about measles, its vaccine and its treatment, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-the-publics-views-on-measles-outbreaks-and-misinformation/"&gt;an April poll by the health-care think tank KFF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WWUVUYTV3BDCJOEIYKQD3AF2RA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“It’s confusing, and maybe that’s part of the strategy,” said Bruce Gellin, who oversaw HHS’s vaccine program in the Bush and Obama administrations.

Experts worry the United States this year will record the largest number of cases since measles was declared eliminated a quarter-century ago. A recent study showed that if U.S. vaccination rates continue to decline, the nation could &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/24/measles-cases-deaths-vaccine-rates-rfk-jr/"&gt;face millions&lt;/a&gt; of cases over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VDYEPAQZJJGCDI6ODHC56RMTJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once an outbreak begins, health officials have only a short time to convince the U.S. public that vaccination is the proven way to save lives, said Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition.

Shortly thereafter, Kennedy wrote in an &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;X post&lt;/a&gt; that “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YSEHXBJ65NAAROTKVOXIKR3KGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hours later in a separate X post, he went on to praise the work of two local doctors who have criticized measles vaccination, and their treatment of measles patients with unproven therapies — budesonide and clarithromycin. Neither has &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-budesonide-and-clarithromycin-unproven-and-risky/?srsltid=AfmBOop53YvHFGlaqvrj5SAVXnYgtlaVL2r9AKtEJxaAEnJyWBmT813X"&gt;been proved effective&lt;/a&gt; as measles treatments and both could have serious side effects, medical experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HLMMGFWGZREHVIUZ276JKKSVJA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The media “don’t notice how he de-emphasizes [vaccination] by just burying it in with a bunch of the other stuff about vitamin A, steroids, better diet, etc.,” said David Gorski, managing editor of Science-Based Medicine, a website run primarily by physicians that debunks medical misinformation. “It’s like they’ve learned nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TSMSAQVLRNHIXOK2FGKROR3X7M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between those two statements, Kennedy drew headlines that portrayed him as a supporter of vaccines, including “Kennedy announces support for measles vaccine amid outbreak” in &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/06/kennedy-support-measles-vaccine-outbreak-00276021"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; and “RFK Jr. makes new push for vaccine after 2nd child dies of measles” on &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/video/rfk-jr-vaccine-is-most-effective-way-to-prevent-measles-spread-236693061564"&gt;Today.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HATBXVY8111NK1C3DZMD55JEW0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/10/rfk-jr-personal-responsibility-health-care-donuts-smoking/"&gt;CBS News interview&lt;/a&gt; released a few days later, Kennedy received similar coverage. An initial clip highlighted Kennedy saying he “&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine/"&gt;encourages&lt;/a&gt;” vaccination — but &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-measles-vaccine/"&gt;left out the context&lt;/a&gt; of his saying he was unsure whether the second child’s death was due to measles. Kennedy also falsely stated again that vaccines are not properly safety-tested, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/11/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing-concerns/?itid=ap_laurenweber_5"&gt;a claim he has made repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZIMALSZAPRESPJAG4OELH4FCYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the interview with McGraw, better known as Dr. Phil, Kennedy claimed that one of his top three priorities is “making sure the vaccines are safe.” He said, erroneously, that the mumps portion and the combination MMR vaccine were never safety-tested. Medical experts said the MMR vaccine has been monitored for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QEP6HISXFFTXPWK4PWZIAQIHA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In response to questions about these claims, HHS said Kennedy would &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/"&gt;institute placebo testing&lt;/a&gt; for all “new vaccines,” but it did not fully clarify what that would mean.

More than a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2275444"&gt;dozen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in peer-reviewed top journals in recent decades have rejected this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X38NGWRVTX5P95RHQ6BRZZ6ZB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When Kennedy talks, he “mixes a blend of fact and fiction, and since he is the highest health official in the country, that’s dangerous,” said Tom Frieden, CDC director under President Barack Obama and president and chief executive of the nonprofit Resolve to Save Lives. “Health advice is best provided by doctors who are deeply experienced with the facts about vaccines, and anything that undermines trust in measles and other vaccines undermines the health and safety of our kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TUWUSPZNEZHGZHICHVJVCGML2I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it comes to news about measles, Kennedy allies have released information to develop a narrative around the illness before others can debunk it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QG43PPTXGZAWZACGM674PHOTHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On April 5, controversial scientist Robert Malone &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/"&gt;was the first&lt;/a&gt; to write that “Another Texas Child Dies a Tragic Death After Recovering from Measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NL3JMDE33VHWVLB2SO74QZUP6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;According to Malone, medical mismanagement was to blame. In a Substack post to his hundreds of thousands of followers, Malone said he wrote after hearing from a physician he said had knowledge of the child’s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6BSZ5EDA4FHIRFJBPJPZ7Y6RMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The press was amplifying the measles outbreak for the “political purposes” of smearing Kennedy, Malone told The Post. Malone previously sued The Post, alleging defamation over the newspaper’s reporting on his advocacy against the coronavirus vaccine. The case was dismissed in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J5G23AEH2BGYLLAFT7MAP5Y7DQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A day after Malone’s Substack account, the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the “&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak"&gt;second measles death&lt;/a&gt;” in a “school-aged child who tested positive for measles.” The child died of what “doctors described as measles pulmonary failure.

He took note that the phrase came in the third paragraph of a long post. And he said the post on X was edited to add language suggesting the measles outbreak was “flattening,” which independent fact-checkers and experts have said is misleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LV75IZ5C4JEYFNMG2NMQ5GFMCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Spencer interpreted the message and its revision as an attempt to speak to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263"&gt;two audiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CADUOG56YFA65NKRQ4BCJ2GISA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you look at all the replies, it was a mix of basically, ‘Look, he says vaccines are really important’ and ‘Oh, my God, I can’t believe you are betraying us,’” Spencer said. “It was fascinating to see how people saw this moment different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6DIZEXCA2VDSFDDOWVK5QJ6Z4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Children’s Health Defense, Kennedy’s former organization, also has published information about the ongoing measles outbreak.

Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado, Louisiana and Arkansas made up the rest of the top 10, per the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawaii, however, was the state deemed to have the best handle on its drug problem, followed by Utah, Nebraska, Connecticut, and Florida. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-461c9u-0 hisihR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico topped the list in individual metrics, ranking first for teenage drug users, third for drug users and seventh in the overdose tally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are major substance abuse concerns amongst teenagers in the state, according to the analysis. New Mexico has been found to have the highest proportion of teens using illicit &lt;a href="/topic/drugs"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; and the highest share of young people reporting they had tried marijuana before the age of 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Virginia, the state deemed to have the second-worst substance abuse problem, has the most drug overdose fatalities in the U.S. The number of deaths in West Virginia is more than nine times greater than in Nebraska, which has the fewest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-uwxkcg-0 sc-uwxkcg-1 dIYBnZ ipsoSp"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-uwxkcg-4 loMtYN number-length-10"&gt;81 deaths &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-uwxkcg-5 kxWqlF"&gt;&lt;p&gt;from drug overdoses in West Virginia, per 100,000 people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those battling drug addiction in the states ranked worst may find it difficult to get the help they need, with a few substance abuse treatment centers and professionals working in mental health for the size of the population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 hOqAvf"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/18/23/Opioid_Companies_Lawsuit_31713.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/18/23/Opioid_Companies_Lawsuit_31713.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/03/18/23/Opioid_Companies_Lawsuit_31713.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Signs are displayed at a tent during a health event, June 26, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia, offering Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-158432"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Signs are displayed at a tent during a health event, June 26, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia, offering Naloxone, a drug that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents in Nevada, ranked third worst on the list, have the poorest access to substance abuse treatment facilities and counselors per capita, the analysis found. The gambling capital was the single worst state for drug health issues and rehabilitation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jennifer Murphy, an associate professor and chair of criminal justice at Pennsylvania State University, says that enhanced access to treatment, not punishment, is key to combating America’s drug crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to enact more policies that give individuals the opportunity to engage in harm reduction and treatment services,” she said. “We need to make these services low-barrier and easy to access so people can get the help that they need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it’s a far wider issue. Gene Heyman, a senior lecturer at Boston College’s Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, says that “the most powerful correlate of drug overdose deaths” is “intergenerational income mobility,” meaning the extent to which an individual is able to have a better life and income than their parents. In places where adult children earn less than their parents, areas that have lost industries such as the Midwest ‘rust belt’ and West Virginia and Kentucky coal mining counties, drug overdoses are higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 12:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPYV9HTHg1bW1PR0dOTi1YYTlFLTU5eC02M1dzLUhnTFZtS05qVlIxSU1qbkpsSFl3YUdJSExlWWgtSnB1RUhnUE5SdExLcFBUamhLR1VjOXlnS0h0aXExVWxxWXZELWNWZnkzQ3VEWUNPWDFUQkhDRm4zbmluUDkyTmF3RHB0X3JROEhKR1Zrb0g4alpEX0drbDlLbEs5amdO</guid></item><item><title>特朗普正在发动一场新的战争。这可能会让您的家人处于危险之中。- HuffPost | Trump Is Waging A New Kind Of War.

The findings suggest that adolescent exposure to this commonly prescribed antidepressant may have lasting effects beyond mood regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor widely used to treat depression, anxiety, and premenstrual disorders, especially in adolescents. Prescription rates for fluoxetine have been rising sharply among young people, particularly girls. The increase has been partly attributed to growing mental health needs during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, during which in-person therapy was less available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown that early-life exposure to fluoxetine can lead to lasting changes in mood, memory, and drug sensitivity. These behavioral effects are often linked to changes in brain circuits involved in emotion regulation, such as the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Some studies have also suggested that fluoxetine can affect inflammatory processes and body weight, raising the question of whether its effects extend into other areas, such as pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our lab has been interested in this topic due to growing concerns about the increased use of antidepressants like Prozac (fluoxetine) among young girls. Since adolescence is a crucial period of development, the idea that medications affecting neurotransmitter systems, like serotonin, may have long-term consequences on brain function and behavior, including pain sensitivity, is particularly alarming,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.utep.edu/liberalarts/psychology/people/sergio-d-iniguez.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sergio Iñiguez&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at El Paso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted a controlled experiment using female C57BL/6 mice, a widely used laboratory strain known for its genetic consistency and well-documented behavioral and physiological responses. Twenty adolescent mice were randomly divided into two groups. One group received fluoxetine dissolved in their drinking water for 15 days during adolescence—starting on postnatal day 35 and ending on day 49. The other group received regular water and served as a control. The dosage of fluoxetine was designed to match levels known to have antidepressant-like effects in rodents, adjusted for the higher metabolic rates found in females and younger animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three weeks after the treatment period ended—when the mice had reached adulthood at postnatal day 70—the researchers assessed the animals’ sensitivity to thermal pain using the hot plate test. This test involves placing a mouse on a heated surface and measuring the time it takes for the mouse to show a pain response, such as licking its hind paw. Shorter reaction times suggest increased sensitivity to pain, a condition known as hyperalgesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that mice exposed to fluoxetine during adolescence responded to the heat stimulus significantly faster than those in the control group. On average, they took less time to lick their hind paw, indicating that they were more sensitive to pain. Importantly, this increased sensitivity was observed well after the drug had been cleared from their system, suggesting a lasting change in their pain-processing mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tracked body weight throughout the experiment. Mice that received fluoxetine began to gain less weight starting on the second day of treatment, and this effect persisted into adulthood. At the time of the pain sensitivity test, the fluoxetine-exposed mice weighed significantly less than the controls. Although reduced body weight might influence pain responses, previous work suggests that fluoxetine does not impair general movement in rodents, making it unlikely that changes in locomotion affected the test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adolescent exposure to antidepressants like Prozac may have long-lasting effects that extend beyond mood regulation and can influence sensory processes, such as pain sensitivity,” Iñiguez told PsyPost. “Increased pain sensitivity in adulthood could be an unintended consequence of SSRIs, which is especially important to consider when prescribing these medications to young people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings align with earlier studies showing that early-life fluoxetine exposure can cause long-term alterations in brain function. In particular, serotonin—the chemical targeted by fluoxetine—plays a key role not only in mood but also in the regulation of pain. Disrupting serotonin levels during adolescence may interfere with the normal development of brain regions involved in processing pain, such as the prefrontal cortex. This area continues to mature during the teenage years and is involved in both emotional regulation and pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have shown that fluoxetine can affect inflammation, another pathway that influences how pain is experienced. For instance, clinical research has found that children and adolescents treated with fluoxetine show elevated levels of inflammatory markers like interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β months after treatment. This kind of immune activity could sensitize pain pathways and lead to lasting changes in how the brain and body respond to discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results of this study are based on an animal model and should not be directly applied to humans without further research, they raise important questions about how antidepressants may influence more than just mood. In particular, they suggest that fluoxetine use during adolescence could carry unintended consequences for sensory processing in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One limitation of the study is that it did not include additional stressors, which are often present in human experiences of depression and anxiety. Stress is known to interact with both mood disorders and pain perception, and it is possible that the combination of fluoxetine and environmental stress would lead to different outcomes. Future research should examine how fluoxetine interacts with stress and other common adolescent experiences, including the use of other medications or the presence of psychiatric symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point to consider is that fluoxetine is prescribed for a range of conditions beyond depression, including eating disorders and premenstrual mood symptoms, both of which are more common in adolescent girls. Since these conditions themselves may involve altered sensitivity to pain or changes in body weight, more studies are needed to tease apart the effects of the medication from the effects of the underlying disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan to evaluate molecular markers within brain circuits involved in pain processing, particularly focusing on regions such as the prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus,” Iñiguez said. “We hope that the findings of this project inspire other researchers to further investigate the potential long-term side effects of SSRIs in adolescents, especially considering that antidepressants are frequently prescribed during this stage of development for a variety of illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2025.04.027" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Prozac exposure during adolescence increases pain sensitivity in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Anapaula Themann, Minerva Rodriguez, Daniel E.

              &lt;p&gt;Moderna’s mRNA-based flu and covid-19 vaccine could provide the best of both worlds—if it’s actually ever approved by the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, scientists at Moderna &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2833668"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; data from a Phase III trial testing the company’s combination vaccine, codenamed mRNA-1083. Individuals given mRNA-1083 appeared to generate the same or even greater immune response compared to those given separate vaccines, the researchers found. But the FDA’s recent policy change on vaccine approvals, orchestrated by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, could imperil the development of this and other future vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trial involved 8,000 people split into two age groups: those between the ages of 50 and 64, and those over 65. People were randomly given mRNA-1083 (plus a placebo) or two already approved flu and covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vaccine seemed effective across both age groups, with mRNA-1083 participants showing at least the same level of humoral immune response (antibody-based) to circulating flu and covid-19 strains as participants who were given the separate vaccines. On average, this response was actually higher to the flu strains in particular among those given mRNA-1083. The experimental vaccine also appeared to be safe and well-tolerated, as the authors &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833668"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, published Wednesday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study results are certainly encouraging, and typically they would pave the way toward a surefire FDA approval. But the political situation has changed for the worse. The Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-calls-new-vaccines-undergo-placebo-controlled/story?id=121412127"&gt;recently mandated&lt;/a&gt; an overhaul of the vaccine approval process, one that will require all new vaccines to undergo placebo-controlled trials to receive approval.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many experimental vaccines today are placebo-tested (including the original covid-19 vaccines), it’s unclear whether this order will also apply to vaccines that can be compared to existing vaccines, like the combination mRNA-1083 vaccine, or to vaccines that have to be regularly updated to match fast-evolving viruses like the flu and covid-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some vaccine experts have said that these changes &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5383172/rfk-jr-placebo-vaccine-testing-studies#:~:text=Offit%2C%20Hotez%20and,an%20ethical%20trial.%22"&gt;are unnecessary and potentially unethical&lt;/a&gt;, since it could leave some people vulnerable to an infection that already has a vaccine. The new rule also might delay the availability of upcoming seasonal vaccines, particularly the &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/01/health/hhs-universal-flu-coronavirus-vaccine-initiative"&gt;current covid-19 shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A potentially important wrinkle for the mRNA-1083 vaccine is that no mRNA-based vaccine for the flu is currently approved. That reality could very well be all that the FDA needs to demand further placebo-controlled trials. RFK Jr. and other recent Trump appointees have also been highly skeptical of mRNA-based vaccines in general, despite no strong evidence that these vaccines are significantly less safe than other types. Kennedy, who has a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-made-a-million-dollars-from-his-anti-vax-work-that-he-previously-claimed-was-unpaid-2000550692"&gt;long history of supporting&lt;/a&gt; the anti-vaccination movement, has even &lt;a href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2021/robert-f-kennedy-jr-said-the-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-deadliest-vaccine-ever-made-thats-not-true/"&gt;wrongly declared&lt;/a&gt; that the mRNA covid-19 vaccine was the “deadliest vaccine ever made.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/moderna-beats-wall-street-estimates-first-quarter-profit-sales-2025-05-01/#:~:text=Moderna%20said%20on%20Thursday%20it%20now%20does%20not%20expect%20regulatory%20approval%20for%20its%20combination%20flu/COVID%2D19%20shot%20until%202026%2C%20after%20the%20FDA%20said%20it%20required%20late%2Dstage%20data%20demonstrating%20the%20shot%27s%20efficacy%20against%20the%20flu."&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; last week it doesn’t expect its mRNA-1083 vaccine to be approved before 2026, following the FDA’s request for late-stage data showing the vaccine’s effectiveness against flu specifically. But it’s worth wondering if even that timeline is now in jeopardy under the current public health regime.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Treating those conditions may help combat the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Burning feet can sometimes be caused by a vitamin B deficiency – a crucial nutrient found in foods including meat and fish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Soaking the feet in cold – rather than hot – water does provide patients with some relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, patients with no clear cause of their burning foot syndrome can also be given medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes amitriptyline, gabapentin and pregabalin, which block abnormal nerve signals. This should reduce the pain and improve sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;I'm 74 and have discoid eczema.

Sometimes, new prescription drugs can trigger it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-42c16c50-2e4c-11f0-905f-5da497a40a06" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14700051/My-feet-feel-like-theyre-burning-stop-DR-ELLIE-reveals-secret-treating-excruciating-syndrome.html"&gt; &lt;font&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;WRITE TO DR ELLIE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Do you have a question for Dr Ellie Cannon? Email DrEllie@mailonsunday.couk&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can occur anywhere on the body, excluding the face. The patches tend to be dry and crusty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As we age, the skin barrier becomes less effective, which means that it can get dehydrated and irritated. This is how discoid eczema occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The key to tackling discoid eczema is rehydrating the skin. One way to do this is using an emollient – which is another word for moisturiser. Some common emollients you can buy from most chemists include E45, Diprobase and Cetraben.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients need to use these regularly – a minimum of twice a day. They should also use the creams in large amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For a discoid eczema patient, a large 500g tub of emollient shouldn’t last longer than a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most pharmacists will stock multiple ones and should be able to help patients pick the one that is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside emollients, a GP can prescribe steroid creams for the patches to reduce the inflammation. But these will only work if the skin is well hydrated with an emollient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s also important to identify triggers that make the eczema worse. Lathery soaps, bubble baths and certain types of washing detergents can cause this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heat is also a known skin irritant, so it’s important to keep rooms in the house cooler. Some patients also find that using a humidifier will stop the skin drying out when the heating is on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If a skin condition started at the same time as a medication, this could also be a trigger. It might be worth discussing switching to an alternative medicine with a GP to see if the symptoms improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, never stop taking prescription drugs without telling your family doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;I am due to have a trapeziectomy on my right thumb, but I’m worried that I could suffer nerve damage. Is this procedure safe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie replies&lt;/span&gt;: Nerve damage is always a possibility after an operation, but the chances of it occurring are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trapezium is a little bone on the wrist right at the bottom of the thumb. It is a common site for osteoarthritis – the painful joint problems caused by long-term wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not only does osteoarthritis in the trapezium impair movement of the thumb, it often leads to constant pain because of how often we use our thumbs. A trapeziectomy is a procedure which involves completely removing the small bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the majority of people this is both safe and effective at reducing pain (patients also retain the majority of movement in the thumb even without the bone).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that around 15 per cent of people who have a trapeziectomy develop some form of nerve damage in the skin around the thumb, which can lead to numbness or tingling. A third of patients also have continued pain or weakness after the operation. For these reasons, surgical procedures like this would only be offered to the most severely affected arthritis patients. Given the intense pain this condition can cause, most people opt for surgery and take the small risk of side-effects. But that is a decision entirely for the patient – and no one else – to decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;GPs must not ignore underweight adults &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I strongly agree with the growing calls for GPs to pay more attention to older patients who are underweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, former health secretary Dame Patricia Hewitt, 76, revealed she nearly died while on holiday after suffering dehydration. She was in hospital for six weeks. Doctors said her low body weight – 7st 11lb – was in part responsible for her severe symptoms and slow recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When patients are underweight, their body lacks energy reserves which can be crucial when patients fall ill, particularly if they eat less, further weakening them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet GPs too often focus on tackling obesity and forget to identify underweight older adults, who could be referred to a diet specialist for treatment. We need to do more to help these patients. Have you fallen sick due to being underweight? Write and let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Will a second NHS app help? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm sceptical of the Government’s latest plan to improve NHS cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, a new app, called Cancer 360, was announced. It is meant to bring cancer patients’ medical data into one place. The Government says it will ‘cut waits and save lives’. But I am confused by this plan (not to mention the bold claims about the good it will do for patients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s true cancer patients often struggle to easily access their records. This is because many are seen by various doctors in separate departments – sometimes in different hospitals. But why isn’t this information being brought together within the NHS App?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Why on Earth are we adding another app to the mix? It’s likely Cancer 360 will face the same problems as the NHS one. Hospitals will not be required to take part in the app, meaning many patients will fail to see a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 11:07:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxNN29MTFNURmRCd3hLcXFmYWk1TW9hWHB4M0ZEcGRNd0lkWExLbmU0d2pGRTJ3dEppYkM3TTRmcVZ5MUFlTWhBdmRsakYtTVN4YkpldWljVXY5ZC1rWWo4eV9lakhzR2xvRnl2b3BCa1NHNnRObW4xeWVYank0N2QxTXFFUk1KTVZ6ZHFrNG5fTHJaMDJPeGU4eXN0SWNpdVRGNTFfakZrV1l3V0tQeEhfMFF1TG15Ynh0QkpQeUlNYW5HaVFKX1pzRDZPM3EwRFppVDhFT0VRUjhQS291bzBUXy0wbw</guid></item><item><title>每个人都突然担心蛋白质。有一个团体是理所当然的--《旧金山纪事报》 | Everyone is suddenly worried about protein.

(Additionally, Kim pointed out that there is a relationship between salt intake and high blood pressure, which, as we now know, is another stroke risk factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to what you &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;eat, Kim points to the work of author and journalist &lt;a href="https://michaelpollan.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Michael Pollan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf820e4b02fbba8e793ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://michaelpollan.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Michael Pollan&lt;/a&gt;. This advice is “eat food, mostly plants, not too much,” Wang said. This means having a diet that’s rich in fruits and veggies with some meat added in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dismiss Necessary Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since strokes are so common in this country (and this world), it’s important that you’re aware of the signs and get treated as soon as possible. Available stroke treatments work better the sooner they’re done, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because many strokes aren’t painful, and the symptoms of stroke vary so much, it’s important to recognize symptoms of stroke,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, there’s a useful acronym to help people remember the signs — and that &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="acronym is FAST" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681cf820e4b02fbba8e793ba" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.stroke.org/en/help-and-support/resource-library/fast-materials" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;acronym is FAST&lt;/a&gt;, Kim said.

Science is figuring out ways to pump those numbers up again and pointing the way toward living more years — and more &lt;em&gt;healthy &lt;/em&gt;years. And this doesn’t require sci-fi, Silicon Valley anti-aging technology like &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2023/07/13/blueprint-ceo-bryan-johnson-defends-plasma-donation-son-youth-aging-longevity-brainstorm-tech-fortune-utah/"&gt;blood swapping&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471491416300533#:~:text=Cellular%20reprogramming%20has%20demonstrated%20that,to%20extend%20a%20healthy%20lifespan."&gt;cellular reprogramming&lt;/a&gt;. According to Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the author of the new book &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Super-Agers/Eric-Topol/9781668067666"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Agers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are evidence-based steps you can take right now to help ensure you live a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’re at a turning point,” Topol told me in an interview this week. “Thanks to advances in the science of aging, we can actually show everything is going in the right direction. We’re making headway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="know-and-lower-your-biological-age" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Know — and lower — your biological age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It used to be that if you wanted to know how old you are, all you needed was a calendar. But your body’s aging isn’t as simple as turning the pages on a calendar: Depending on who you are and how you live, different parts of your body can age more quickly or slowly than. And it turns out this other kind of aging, biological aging, matters more for your health than the number of candles on your birthday cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Super Agers&lt;/em&gt;, Topol points to a “metric revolution” in which blood-based proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores can pinpoint which organ system is aging the fastest, and by how many years. A 2024 &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine &lt;/em&gt;study used machine learning to &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/gauging-biological-age-disease-risk-proteomic-clock"&gt;examine&lt;/a&gt; more than 200 plasma proteins in thousands of people and showed that the resulting biological age forecasted 18 major diseases and all-cause mortality better than any single risk factor, like blood pressure or body mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“When you particularize risk to a person, the chance of them taking actions to mitigate it is much, much higher,” Topol said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s one thing to know generally that as you get older, you need to be aware of the risks of heart disease or neurodegenerative diseases. It’s another thing to be told that your brain age is, say, five years ahead of your calendar age — which means you need to intervene now to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;Companies are &lt;a href="https://tallyhealth.com/products/test-kit"&gt;already offering&lt;/a&gt; biological age tests that &lt;a href="https://outliyr.com/best-epigenetic-age-tests-review"&gt;you can order&lt;/a&gt; for your own use. Down the line, scientists at the University of Washington are &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/new-health-assessment-tool-gauges-bodys-biological-age"&gt;developing&lt;/a&gt; a multi-organ biological clock that will be developed into a digital app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="eat-like-the-mediterraneans-do" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Eat like the Mediterraneans do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s no field where the prevailing advice seems more conflicting and confusing than in the science of nutrition.

That means plenty of whole grains, vegetables, olive oil, and omega-rich seafood. You should also try to cut out sugars and ultraprocessed foods as much as possible, and go very easy on red meat, which Topol notes can trigger &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959437X24001552?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;aging-accelerating inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;Start by something as simple as swapping out butter for olive oil and soda for sparkling water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="sleep-more-and-sleep-deeper" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Sleep more — and sleep deeper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At this point, I think everyone knows &lt;a href="/science-and-health/2018/4/16/17233860/night-owl-chronobiology-sleeping-late-health-risk"&gt;just how important&lt;/a&gt; it is to get a good night’s sleep. Poor sleep is &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/health-risks-of-poor-sleep"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with everything from heart disease to diabetes to dementia to obesity to cancer, not to mention a significantly increased risk of watching way too many Netflix shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as Topol told me, it’s not just how much sleep you’re getting, but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you’re sleeping. “The key thing is deep sleep,” he said. “If you don’t get it, you’re much more subject to brain aging and the three major diseases of aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Research &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40110600/"&gt;has shown&lt;/a&gt; that people who get fewer hours of deep sleep per night have a greater risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, while a larger amount of deep sleep &lt;a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2023/05/03/deep-sleep-may-mitigate-alzheimers-memory-loss-berkeley-research-shows/"&gt;can act as a protection&lt;/a&gt; against Alzheimer’s-related memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;During the writing of &lt;em&gt;Super Agers&lt;/em&gt;, Topol increased his own deep sleep from around 15 minutes per night to over an hour by adhering to a consistent sleep schedule and tracking his progress with wearables. And steer clear of drugs and supplements, which are unlikely to help you get the deep, restorative slumber you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a cardiologist, Topol was long focused on aerobic exercise, which helps build up the cardiovascular system. But he now realizes that’s not enough. “Aerobic was the thing,” he told me. “Now we know that strength and core training are equally important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;One meta-analysis from 2022 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35599175/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that just an hour of resistance training per week lowered all-cause mortality by as much as 25 percent. And beyond trying to reduce the chance of death, strength training when you’re younger helps build up muscle mass, slowing down the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2804956/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20striking,60%20%5B4%2C5%5D."&gt;inevitable decline of muscle that occurs as you age&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have to start &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/"&gt;pumping iron&lt;/a&gt; like 1970s Arnold Schwarzenegger to get the anti-aging benefits of strength training. Bodyweight exercises will go a long way, as will resistance training that involves exercise bands. And as much as you may hate them, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/those-squat-pulses-burn-fire-171649684.html"&gt;don’t neglect those squats!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It may seem inevitable that as you age, your social circle and connections shrink. But it doesn’t have to be that way — and there are enormous longevity benefits to keeping connected to the world and the people around you. “The strong data for social isolation shows it will compromise healthy aging,” Topol said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37337095/"&gt;linked social isolation&lt;/a&gt; to a 32 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality, while self-reported loneliness specifically tacked on another 14 percent. Neuro-imaging studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9702717/"&gt;have even shown&lt;/a&gt; a biological effect from being alone, demonstrating spikes in inflammatory cytokines and the shrinkage of hippocampal volume in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do: &lt;/strong&gt;Get off your couch and out of your house, for one thing! Schedule regular face time with a friend, and ideally do it outside: Frequent time in nature &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82747-3"&gt;has been associated&lt;/a&gt; with reduced epigenetic aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s plenty more in &lt;em&gt;Super Agers&lt;/em&gt;, including Topol’s optimism around GLP-1 inhibitors like Ozempic, which have been showing the ability to reduce the &lt;a href="https://aaic.alz.org/releases-2024/glp-drug-liraglutide-may-protect-against-dementia.asp#:~:text=Cognitive%20function%20was%20calculated%20as,Edison%20said."&gt;risk of diseases of aging like dementia&lt;/a&gt;. But you don’t need cutting-edge medicines to live a longer, healthier life.

I'm pretty in tune with my body. This was not normal for me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon mentioning to her GP, Gemma's symptoms were overlooked and simply put down to a recent bout of sickness, with nothing alarming to note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, over the following two months, her bleeding got worse and that's when Gemma knew she had to press for further answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went to a different GP, and I'm very grateful that she took it more seriously and said "okay, let's just get an ultrasound to rule out anything possible",' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Personal trainer Gemma Henly (pictured) was the picture of health, before her shock ovarian cancer diagnosis at 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After noticing a change in her menstrual cycles, Gemma sought answers from two separate GP's for her worrying symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately, or fortunately I guess, we found it (the cancer) and that started a cascade of more tests.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In February 2025, Gemma's blood tests and pelvic ultrasound revealed she had abnormal growths on both of her ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was surreal, but I think you just go into shock,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My gynaecologist had emailed to say to bring a support person to my appointment. So, I think instantly you know it's not going to be good news.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With no family history of cancer, a clean bill of health and already being up to date with her cervical screening tests, it was the last thing Gemma thought she'd hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctors knew time was precious, and although immediate surgery was crucial, there was another factor they had to consider - and that was children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was referred to a gynaecological oncologist who was the surgeon, to explore all avenues as to whether there was any chance we could preserve my fertility,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was hope that we could potentially preserve my uterus so even if I couldn't use my own eggs, I could potentially look at like a donor egg option in in the future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being diagnosed with Stage 1C ovarian and Stage 1A uterus cancer, Gemma underwent a total hysterectomy in March 2025, followed by chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Although she still has a long road ahead of her, Gemma is still focused on her fitness and trying to still move her body every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sadly for Gemma, further tests, biopsies and keyhole surgery revealed the cancer had spread to her uterus too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gemma's ovarian cancer was found at Stage 1C and the cancer in her uterus was Stage 1A, which is early, but still very serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the beginning of March 2025, surgeons performed a total hysterectomy, removing her uterus including both of her ovaries and fallopian tubes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think it's something that I probably won't process properly for a little while. I wasn't actively trying to have a family right now, but it's something that I wanted for my future,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gemma has been with her supportive partner (pictured) for three years.

Pictured: Her second chemotherapy session in April, just shy of her 31st birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gemma, who has been with her partner for three years said she's dealt with 'lots of emotions' around the heartbreaking decision that has robbed her of carrying a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He's been a rock. I'm very, very lucky in that respect,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With just four weeks recovery, Gemma was straight into her chemotherapy treatments where she has now completed two rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although a long road to recovery awaits her, Gemma is still focused on her fitness and trying to move her body every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They say it really helps with your side effects, too, plus from a mental and emotional point [of view] it's really important to try and stay as active as I can,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and help from her wellness community in Burleigh and beyond, Gemma will finish chemo over the coming months and has bravely shaved her head in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;You can donate to Gemma's campaign via the link in the bullet points at the top of this article.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 10:51:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>在水中添加1种食物可以减少腹部脂肪-而不是柠檬- Surrey Live | Adding 1 food item to your water could reduce belly fat - not lemons - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTE1acmF3cGxIZVVWLXVBcUV3RWI4VjVOeHJCcjVSUUMtcXZQQ1k3OEtoTkpQQjVUdUE0aFN0SnlaSWNfQ0pLZmhOcEJrZ1hnQU1GMGE5RFZfUnBvd3lfY2JfNkxPanRUM1JRUVowOW1JR3l0a1pVZUpxamsyTVVIQdIBgwFBVV95cUxNYjBvNDlTOW5TSWlsV3BNbkRzOUVxWHp3M2xwckJhOEVfSnl3NENZekNFTVd0Um5CeGVLR3JyVVowYzltRnQzRFBVQUIwNzNNQkpXX3BMTUh5UXdPS0ExSllRQVlJRS0wd3IzTHJ6RmpJUW1ZQkN5UzFkbmhkOE8zdjNuMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss can be extremely difficult and has been a &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/full-meal-plan-diet-could-31591056" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;pressing issue&lt;/a&gt; for those in the UK, especially those suffering from increased &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/inside-dopamine-diet-saw-tom-31590457" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;belly fat. &lt;/a&gt;A study conducted in 2024 showed that more than four in ten Brits report that they are actively trying to &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/weight-loss" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;shed a few pounds. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to click2pharmacy, one in four children in England is currently &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/diets" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;on a diet&lt;/a&gt;, "indicating that weight management is a priority across various age groups." Many people will turn to fad diets for their weight loss, such as the keto diet and the Atkins diet, which prioritise low-carb eating. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, health experts at Bupa have debunked these fad diets for only working in the short term. They shared: "Cutting out carbohydrates means people usually don’t get enough fibre. This can have a long-term effect on your gut health and may also increase your risk of heart problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Instead of cutting out carbohydrates altogether, you could switch to complex carbs such as brown rice, brown bread, and wholemeal pasta." However, there is one superfood that has become a popular choice in weight-loss diets and can be simply added to a glass of water: chia seeds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31616178" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are Chia seeds, and how do they aid in weight loss? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chia seeds are small edible seeds that are oval and grey in colour with black and white spots. The seeds are packed with fibre, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are key players in weight management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"One of the great things about chia seeds is that they swell up when mixed with liquid, creating a gel-like texture that helps you stay full for longer," reported Healthera. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By taking two tablespoons of chia seeds, this equates to almost 10 grams of fibre. That’s around 40 per cent of the recommended daily intake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts at Healthline shared that diets high in fibre have been linked to weight loss. According to 2015 research, eating 30 grams of fibre daily may help you lose as much weight as if you followed a more complicated diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31616184" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Adding chia seeds to water&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you eat chia seeds, the soluble fibre soaks up water and expands in your stomach, helping you feel full longer. While chia seeds cannot single-handedly burn belly fat, adding chia seed water to a balanced diet can help by increasing digestion, making you feel less hungry and offering long-lasting energy to support exercise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nutrients per serving according to WebMD &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 1-ounce serving of chia seeds has:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Calories: 138&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Protein: 4.7 grams&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fat: 8.7 grams&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Carbohydrates: 12 grams&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Fibre: 9.8 grams&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sugar: 0 grams&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31616291" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

From improving the cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure, body weight, and body mass index (BMI), to lowering blood sugar, boosting immune function, and improving mood, walking offers several physical and mental health benefits.Dr. Manan Vora, an orthopedic surgeon and sport and exercise medicine specialist based in Mumbai, has now shared the powerful health benefits of walking that accumulate with every step. The health expert, who has over 450K Instagram followers on Instagram, recently shared a minute-by-minute breakdown of how walking transforms the body, from just 60 seconds to a full hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every minute you walk… your body thanks you,” the orthopedic surgeon said in a video shared on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one minute of walking jumpstarts blood flow, Dr. Vora explained. This small burst of movement enhances circulation, delivering oxygen and nutrients to muscles and organs. By five minutes, the benefits surge, with individuals often experiencing an uplifted mood as endorphins begin to flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching the 10-minute mark, the body starts to reduce cortisol, the hormone associated with stress. This will start to melt away tension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking for 15 minutes can help regulate glucose levels, and will help manage diabetes by preventing blood glucuose spikes after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Kate Cassidy Hits Pause After Inheritance Liam Payne Snub: 'Hard For Me To Get Out Of Bed...'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/fitness/20-benefits-of-walking-for-30-minutes-every-day/articleshow/120368296.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;30 minutes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, walking shifts the body into fat-burning mode. “Your body starts tapping into fat stores,” Dr. Vora said. This duration is a sweet spot for those aiming to improve body composition. Those who are on a weight loss journey can also aim to get 30 minutes of brisk walking in their fitness routine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2017 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622105833#ab0005" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; looked into how moderate walking enhances the effects of an energy-restricted diet on fat mass loss. "Participation in a 12-week weight-loss study resulted in significant reductions in body weight and fat mass and was associated with significant improvements in biomarkers for cardiovascular disease risk. Moderate walking enhanced the effects of a hypoenergetic diet (DI) on fat loss and serum insulin,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits continue to build over time. By 45 minutes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/walk" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;ing reduces overthinking. A long walk can quiet the mind and help you break free from repetitive thoughts. For those who reach 60 minutes, the rewards are even greater. Dr. Vora pointed out that an hour of walking boosts dopamine, the brain’s feel-good neurotransmitter. “Your brain rewards you with dopamine,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who knew a simple walk could be your best therapy! Start small. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consult your healthcare provider before adding any new exercise to your routine, especially if you have underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxNYkFrZ3I1UC1kdVYwSWgtX1hkNGY5QU9qWjFzSlRlaVhxejdhYWlMX1M4RTgyRzNud1VYMXVPMmRMek1IRC0xdXpiVVM5TmRjYzRkdXV0cW5FWFFkeDI5OU5kV1U2V1dSMTBjWk4zZUhIcndBT3BWR2ZubDdaOGo0eU5SME10RVVJSG8yV3N3X29ITWhSaHBEMXBIc1B1ODh3dkFPUkZ1VVpIeTBNNERmQWpiTDhuZnJYNFlTRHIwazBOWEtPenJDYlFxdURHVlFwVVhGeTFJWDNVVjVCR1dWNFkwWkdSdmJkQVV1VTh2NU9LbmRab2lnamItNERrNVh6TGt2Nm03SkxiajZDeW1PQ0M1SUt6SmRmbnJRa0tEeXRkUC14Wl9j</guid></item><item><title>双胞胎母亲在癌症治疗失败后颠覆了她的生活，在芝加哥进行双肺移植-芝加哥太阳时报 | Mother of twins upends her life for double lung transplant in Chicago after failed cancer treatments - Chicago Sun-Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPWHRLVUZBNVl5OEdZQm5FeUdYQ05zU3lCRHNvbGpMSUFnTjZFYkJoX1BLRlc3S1NFUXloaUpwVFkzd1pRTDR2SnNPWTNIdFRtVEs2WGhFdi1MQ1BYVUVsN25fUFhKYkJtOFQtZEFCcUV5ZzQ1MWJCbER4Z1lEZXZpRWJ4a0J3Z3oxNU5pZzVNNGRfQ1d5STNuOFhWSGRqU21VUnh0a25kc0xqTGU2QU1Wa2g1VUVrLVBGbGZGM0Vzdm12MjVwa21N?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody"&gt;
                                    
                                        
                                    &lt;p&gt;Cornelia Tischmacher had always longed to become a mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then at 40 years old, she gave birth to twins, Leo and Lucie. But within a year of their births, doctors in her native Germany diagnosed her with lung cancer despite not having any significant history of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the one thing that just cannot happen,” Tischmacher recalled thinking as she recounted her ordeal recently from a Northwestern Memorial Hospital exam room. “Because my husband is also 18 years older, I thought, ‘Who will take care of them if I am not around?’ So I thought to myself — there is no alternative. You have to survive.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surviving the past six years has meant chemotherapies, immunotherapies, clinical trials and a lobectomy, which is a surgery that removes a section of an organ. But the cancer persisted. Even as Tischmacher’s health declined and she was unable to cook a meal, she continued getting up each morning and helping her twins with their homework, even if it meant doing so from a couch in their Berlin home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She decided to try for more. Faced with a terminal stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis, she arrived in Chicago last December for a double lung transplant at Northwestern Medicine. Five months later, she is no longer showing any signs of cancer, said Dr. Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery at Northwestern Medicine Canning Thoracic Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tischmacher, 48, can now breathe on her own and is beginning to tour Chicago. She will have to remain in the city for at least a year without her children, now 8 years old, and her husband as she recovers — and survives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

                        
                    
                
            
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tischmacher’s &lt;a class="Link" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2025/04/06/grandma-lung-cancer-health-smoking" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lung cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is part of an alarming trend doctors are seeing among women with no significant history of smoking, Bharat said. Because the women, who are in their 40s and 50s, don’t have a history of smoking, they aren’t being diagnosed until the cancer is advanced and more severe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tischmacher, who upended both her personal and professional life, was told by doctors in Germany that she wasn’t eligible for a lung transplant. That’s when she learned from parents at her son’s school about a program at Northwestern that does transplants on lung cancer patients known as&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.nm.org/conditions-and-care-areas/pulmonary/dream-program" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt; &lt;u&gt;DREAM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Double Lung Transplant Registry Aimed for Lung-Limited Malignancies. The program uses a new and modified surgical technique that removes both lungs before inserting the donated organ, Bharat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting to Chicago proved challenging. She couldn’t fly commercial because of her oxygen needs. Then when she arrived in the U.S., she had to fly to Toronto to visit a U.S. embassy to secure a temporary visitor’s visa for&lt;a class="Link" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/war-in-gaza/2025/04/07/wounded-children-gaza-arrive-in-chicago-medical-care" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt; &lt;u&gt;medical treatment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tischmacher’s cancer was rapidly advancing, but it had not spread to other organs, which meant she was eligible for the transplant, Bharat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was in what we call impending respiratory failure, meaning the shutdown of lungs was quite imminent because of how extensive the cancer had become,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

        &lt;div class="Figure-content"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="Figure-caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, according to Northwestern Medicine, and there’s a growing number of younger women being diagnosed who have no history, or limited history, of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

                        
                    
                
            
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double lung transplant takes 8 to 10 hours, during which doctors remove the lungs while also ensuring that the billions of cancer cells don’t enter the blood stream or chest cavity, Bharat said. There is a point in the surgery when the patient doesn’t have any lungs and is sustained by machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tischmacher’s case, there were extra challenges because of the prior surgery and cancer treatments, Bharat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lung and cancer was stuck to the surrounding structures,” he said. “So that poses particular challenges because when you’re dissecting all of that off from under the surface of the ribs, from the heart, from the diaphragm, from the lining around the heart and all the nerves that run inside the chest cavity — you cannot afford to leave a single cell behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bharat said he doesn’t see the surgery as a replacement for cancer treatments, but instead an option for people like Tischmacher who have exhausted all other treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tischmacher will be monitored by doctors for infections or signs of cancer over the year as she remains in Chicago. She struggles going up stairs, but she is walking about 10,000 steps a day through Chicago’s Loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mornings are typically spent coordinating things for her children and she tries to video chat with them every other day. The twins visited for the first time last month, and saw the city from the top of Willis Tower and played at Maggie Daley Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

You should go because it’s true, we can’t even go ice skating together.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her children plan to visit Chicago during their summer vacation, and she hopes to be home with them by Christmas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                                            &lt;p data-start="410" data-end="778"&gt;&lt;span&gt;With measles cases in the United States now exceeding 1,000 and 14 active outbreaks &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; (defined as three or more related cases) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;confirmed, the V.I. Department of Health said it is ramping up efforts to prevent the virus from reaching the territory. Health officials are making a direct appeal to unvaccinated families to reconsider their decision and take immediate action.&lt;/span&gt;
                                                                                        

                            

                                                             
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-start="780" data-end="1160"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Health Commissioner Justa Encarnacion, the department is particularly concerned given the timing of increased travel during summer months. “We are very concerned about measles reaching our shores, especially as individuals and families travel to and from the U.S. Virgin Islands for summer vacation,” she said. “This is a critical time to take preventative action.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="1162" data-end="1356"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Currently, more than 50 percent of USVI children under the age of six have not received the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, placing a significant portion of the population at risk, DOH said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="1405" data-end="1814"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a move to proactively reduce vulnerability in the territory, the department's Immunization Division on Friday mailed approximately 500 letters to parents and guardians who had previously requested and received exemptions from routine childhood vaccinations. The letter, signed by Encarnacion, strongly encourages families to vaccinate their children against measles, mumps, and rubella.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="1816" data-end="2117"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, and unvaccinated children are at significant risk of becoming seriously ill if exposed,” the letter states. “We are deeply concerned by the growing number of cases on the mainland and want to prevent a similar outbreak here in the Virgin Islands.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="2119" data-end="2315"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The communication also explains the serious complications that can result from measles infection, including pneumonia, brain swelling or encephalitis, hearing loss, and even death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="2317" data-end="2592"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), receiving two doses of the MMR vaccine provides 97 percent protection against measles and is considered both safe and effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="2644" data-end="2947"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC’s most recent update reports 1,001 confirmed measles cases across 31 states. Approximately 96 percent of those infected were unvaccinated, and 30 percent were children under the age of five. The outbreak has so far resulted in three deaths—two children and one adult.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="2949" data-end="3217"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials in the territory warn that the risk extends beyond individual families. Unvaccinated people pose a danger to vulnerable populations, including infants under one year of age, individuals with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="3219" data-end="3423"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Vaccination remains the best and most reliable defense we have,” said Commissioner Encarnacion. “We’re asking parents to act now, not just for their children, but for the health of the entire community.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="3477" data-end="3747"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The department’s ongoing education campaign includes outreach via radio, social media, and the distribution of printed materials. The effort to reach parents directly is just one facet of a broader initiative to raise awareness and encourage vaccination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="3749" data-end="4068"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In April, Encarnacion activated the Public Health Preparedness and Immunization divisions, which have been working in collaboration with Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tai Hunte-Ceasar and Territorial Epidemiologist Dr. Esther Ellis to prepare for a potential outbreak in the Virgin Islands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="4070" data-end="4286"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These preparedness efforts involve coordination with healthcare providers, federally qualified health centers, and hospitals across the territory to ensure a timely and effective response if cases emerge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p data-start="4332" data-end="4500"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parents with questions about the MMR vaccine or seeking help with scheduling vaccination appointments are encouraged to contact the Maternal Child Health Clinic at:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
