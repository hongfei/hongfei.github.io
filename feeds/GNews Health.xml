Berries — especially strawberries and blueberries — for example, get a score of 1 if two or more servings are consumed per week. The score drops to 0.5 if just one serving per week is consumed and a score of 0 if none are.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A person’s individual diet gets an overall rating by adding up the scores for individual foods. The higher the overall score, the better it’s for the person’s brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Park and her colleagues turned to data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults who had provided information about what they ate as part of a research project known as &lt;a href="https://www.uhcancercenter.org/for-researchers/mec-cohort-composition" target="_blank"&gt;The Multiethnic Cohort &lt;/a&gt;to get a closer look at how diet influenced the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Multiethnic Cohort was started in the early 1990s through a joint effort of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. The men and women enrolled in the study came from five ethnic/racial populations: Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, Black Americans, Latinos and whites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the outset, the 215,000 participants were ages 45 to 75. When data for the new study was analyzed, more than 21,000 participants had developed Alzheimer’s or a related dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the beginning of the study, people who scored higher for adherence to MIND had a 9% lower risk of developing dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The amount of reduction varied among the racial groups in the new analysis. Greater risk reduction, 13%, was seen in participants who identified as Black, Latino or white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Participants who improved their adherence to MIND over the 10-year period had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared with those whose adherence declined, and that trend was seen across all age and racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-cf33a5" class="body-heading"&gt;How to follow the MIND diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some suggestions for reaching the optimal score for the MIND diet, according to a&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/j.jalz.2015.04.011" target="_blank"&gt; 2015 study&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy green vegetables, such as kale, spinach, broccoli, bok choy and mustard: six or more servings per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other vegetables: one serving per day &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts, such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios: five or more servings per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheese: less than one per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains: three or more per day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fish (not fried): one or more servings per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red meat: less than one serving per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast fried foods: less than one per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pastries and sweets: less than five servings per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Park cautioned that like all observational studies, the new research reports an association and doesn’t prove that the diet prevents dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It is a high-quality study, Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It adds to the evidence that a Mediterranean-type diet has important benefits for reducing the risk of dementia,” said Willett, who wasn’t involved in the research. “The differences between groups defined by race/ethnicity may well be due to random variation, so at this time it’s reasonable to assume that this healthy dietary pattern has benefits for all groups." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When it comes to leafy green vegetables, it’s probably best to consume a variety rather than a single type, Willett said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“In particular, spinach is good in many ways, but has high oxalate content and high intake of spinach can cause kidney stones,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In general, the MIND diet is in line with the principles of the two diets it’s built from, said Dr. Yian Gu, an associate professor of neurological sciences at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “Each of those diets has unique characteristics,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/mediterranean-diet-reduce-risk-dementia-alzheimers-science-rcna74246" target="_blank"&gt;The Mediterranean diet &lt;/a&gt;emphasizes multiple daily servings of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, legumes, olive oil, seafood, and nuts and seeds, such as chia, flax, pumpkin and sesame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" target="_blank"&gt;DASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension,&lt;/a&gt; is meant to prevent hypertension, so it emphasizes low salt, which isn’t a major component in the Mediterranean diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The MIND diet is easy to follow, Gu said, encouraging people to pick the green, leafy vegetables they prefer. What’s important is to increase the diversity of vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Another benefit of Mediterranean-type diets: They are helpful with other types of chronic disease, including heart disease and cancer, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNUzhSMjM1a2NtQkptYnBuNXFTMHBDYlM1RTRuaVZBZV84am9FQmVPLXRwN2J6eHlJS1Y2NG5FRzRhWTZ4djVZLVpkUXBQVFNrelBRS01TLTJ1amtGYXdpUFd6cVlaNXBOTkd0bVJoS1Y3V0FHOGpKSkFxR2kxTk5udlYydkNueFZUUk9qSDdQVkpZZmZBZkE</guid></item><item><title>专栏|对在工作中使用卫生间感到紧张？胃肠病学家分享建议。-《华盛顿邮报》 | Column | Nervous about using the bathroom at work?

But many of you have sent me questions about them. I’ll start with one of the biggest concerns: How do we avoid poopy water spraying us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RH5M2XA3GBE57NZPK3LJS7WSZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Let me just say, if this were remotely a regular possibility, no one would use bidets. Like, &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt;. Bidets would not have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/05/22/damon-young-bidet-changed-my-life-why-dont-i-own-bidet/" target="_blank"&gt;the cult following&lt;/a&gt; they so rightly have earned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6EBNYX7WRHDDB5JCUYVN6PBAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whether you’re using an attachable bidet nozzle or an entire bidet seat on your toilet (these are both different from the stand-alone bidet bowls you often see in Europe), the water is absolutely not coming from the bottom of the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HU3F5MEQ2BF7LJ4GWPFYA44QFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you connect a bidet to your indoor plumbing, the piping routes some water into the toilet bowl, per usual, and routes an entirely separate stream through the bidet nozzle. The two streams do not mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DU5T34PNAJB7RHGUBBHYFZMHIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s what happens next: You poop into the toilet bowl as you would, and the bidet nozzle sprays you clean. Most bidets have adjustable spray angles and pressures, so you direct the water and can easily avoid any splashing. Many models have nozzles that tuck themselves away when not in use, meaning, even if you splattered while pooping, they’re shielded. Several also have a “self-cleaning” feature, just for the nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YFZE6D6HLNBHXGT4EHAHPQZDN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lastly, depending on the bidet, you may still want or need to pat dry afterward. Many fancy bidet seats, in addition to being heated, have a built-in air dryer of their own — ah, the joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:31:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5YanlEd2tJV3NnWHRveWtsNlluejF1MzhDdmpqcWdBSGdic3dFTGR3UUFkYjlFYzFXVUdHT0ZpdE52UEpZa2h3b1JkdzI0U1VEOGRXb0xuZkpqcFB2MlJBWlpJQWN4RVQyNlFkZ3BGY2w1bkQ0c3c</guid></item><item><title>每天三秒的力量训练无需在健身房花费数小时即可锻炼肌肉：以下是如何做到的- The Daily Galaxy | Three Seconds of Strength Training a Day Is All It Takes to Build Muscle Without Spending Hours at the Gym: Here’s How to Do It - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7wFBVV95cUxPUVVYWHYxMmpPNjRadndXTG1GLXRCdlRXZnRwc1VSMzBTT1JTV3R4clRqQy1nOW9hTkREMkJqSW5fVHRwbFBienB6TGJ6ak13WUxESklDblRtd0NtU3lodEJOdUxDWVBfZTdUQjJKQ3F5a2ZNalo5WlZIa3ZNc2RvX0VYY3FXSUFWM1d2cmRFc2d3WjFDSWVfQmU3cEpxTW42UjNlVEZ0dTJYckJNdDl0bjVWM3liNDJRNzBPOWd3UWtZMDUya0d5dkQtUGMyNGM0dnI5QnAyQjhnWTNaVi1aczNUSkxMekZTUlhHeGUwWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study out of &lt;strong&gt;Edith Cowan University&lt;/strong&gt; in Perth, Australia, suggests that a few seconds of focused muscle training each day might be enough to increase strength — a surprising finding that could reshape how people think about &lt;strong&gt;exercise&lt;/strong&gt;. The research, published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.14138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF&lt;br&gt;MEDICINE &amp;amp; SCIENCE IN SPORTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, conducted in collaboration with scientists from &lt;strong&gt;Japan&lt;/strong&gt;, tested whether brief muscle contractions could improve strength without the need for lengthy workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Testing the Limits of Muscle Contractions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the experiment, &lt;strong&gt;49 sedentary young adults participated&lt;/strong&gt;, split into four groups, to perform different types of &lt;strong&gt;biceps exercises&lt;/strong&gt;. Over four weeks, participants completed a&lt;strong&gt; single three-second movement&lt;/strong&gt; five days a week using their maximum weight load. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exercises focused on three contraction types: &lt;strong&gt;concentric&lt;/strong&gt;, which involves lifting a weight; &lt;strong&gt;isometric&lt;/strong&gt;, which means holding the weight still; and &lt;strong&gt;eccentric&lt;/strong&gt;, which is controlling the lowering of the weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eccentric Contractions Lead to the Biggest Gains&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were unexpected. Those who performed &lt;strong&gt;eccentric contractions&lt;/strong&gt; showed the most substantial gains in strength — improvements ranged between &lt;strong&gt;10 and 13 percent&lt;/strong&gt; across all measured types of muscle contraction. The concentric group recorded a smaller increase of &lt;strong&gt;6.3 percent&lt;/strong&gt; in isometric strength, while the isometric group saw a &lt;strong&gt;7.2 percent gain&lt;/strong&gt; in eccentric strength. The control group, which did not train, exhibited no change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eccentric training&lt;/strong&gt; has long been understood to create &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/what-happens-body-drink-baking-soda-water/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7378" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher muscle tension&lt;/a&gt; than other contraction forms. Controlling the downward motion of a weight causes muscle fibers to endure greater stress, which in turn stimulates both the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/straight-out-of-a-sci-fi-nightmare-scientists-just-created-a-robot-that-bleeds-and-even-dies-if-you-stab-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81017" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt; and muscular adaptation more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, despite strength gains, none of the participants showed significant increases in &lt;strong&gt;muscle size&lt;/strong&gt;. The researchers attribute this to early-stage neural adaptations — the brain improving its ability to activate existing muscle fibers before muscle volume grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential for Ultra-Efficient Training Routines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher &lt;strong&gt;Professor Ken Nosaka&lt;/strong&gt; expressed optimism about the findings, noting the potential for such training to fit into busy lifestyles. “If we discover that the three-second rule applies to other muscles, you could perform a &lt;strong&gt;full workout in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;under 30 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the study’s short timeframe and focus on the biceps raise questions about whether the results would hold true for larger muscle groups like the legs or back, or over a longer period. Those aiming to increase &lt;strong&gt;muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt; might also need to combine such brief sessions with more traditional exercises. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, these findings offer a new perspective on strength training, highlighting the power of brief but targeted effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

Nearly a quarter believe drinking water and staying hydrated will prevent a sunburn (the latter is a theory none other than Tom Brady &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tom-bradys-absurd-anti-sunburn-hack-confirms-his-tb12-method-is-the-new-goop/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20I%20was%20growing%20up,keep%20my%20skin%20from%20peeling." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tom-bradys-absurd-anti-sunburn-hack-confirms-his-tb12-method-is-the-new-goop/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20I%20was%20growing%20up,keep%20my%20skin%20from%20peeling."&gt;seems to believe&lt;/a&gt;, per his 2017 book, “The TB12 Method”).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital dermatologist &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/abby.waldmanmd?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.instagram.com/abby.waldmanmd?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw=="&gt;Abigail Waldman&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t need a study to show her the growing skepticism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She learned that firsthand, in 2023, when she posted a TikTok video with what seemed like basic, if perhaps even dull, advice: wear sunscreen on exposed skin and reapply it regularly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The vitriolic responses, and there were hundreds, had a theme: She was a shill for big pharma. She was propagating the lie that sunscreen protects against skin cancer. She was saying this to … somehow … get more patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I had no idea that this was a public sentiment,” she said. “It had never been discussed in medical school or any of my training.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the misconception that it’s harmful is so common that even educated people believe it, she said. “I went to play tennis yesterday, and my coach was like, ‘I’m not putting chemicals on my body.’ He’s an engineer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The skepticism has its roots in reality, if only very tangentially, said Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of cancer prevention at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, whose research focuses in part on false claims connected to cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is a phenomenon we see in a lot of cancer misinformation,” he said. “There is a kernel of truth to a story.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For example, he said: a study is done in a test tube or an animal that shows a compound found in microscopic levels in sunscreen, when exposed to ultraviolet light, could cause DNA damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That result, taken out of context, makes its way to social media, where it’s sensationalized and amplified. “By the time it gets to your social media feed, it doesn’t resemble the original piece of information,” he said. “No one goes back to the original paper and sees that it was in mice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Even if sunscreen raised your risk for skin cancer — which it doesn’t, he emphasized — its well-established cancer-fighting benefits would outweigh any risk. “If you’re trying to make a choice, the choice is pretty clear.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are two types of sunscreens: physical blockers, which have zinc oxide or titanium dioxide and reflect ultraviolet rays from the sun; and chemical blockers, which contain chemicals that absorb the sun’s ultraviolet rays. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

It would take an individual 277 years of sunscreen use to achieve the equivalent systemic dose that produced effects in these rat studies…”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But what’s Harvard Health Publishing compared to the wisdom, or at least the reach, of social media star and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/kristin-cavallari-sunscreen-rcna147878" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.today.com/health/skin-beauty/kristin-cavallari-sunscreen-rcna147878"&gt;UV denier Kristin Cavallari&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Anytime I do an interview, I get a lot of s*** when I admit that I don’t [wear sunscreen],” she said in a viral 2024 episode of her “Let’s Be Honest” podcast, before prompting her guest to talk “about the health benefits of the sun and why we maybe don’t need sunscreen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’ve literally spent our whole existence as humans under the sun all day, until the last, like, 100 years or so, and now we’re like shut-ins … and that’s really bad for a lot of reasons,“ her guest replied.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At Castle Island on a recent weekday, the weather app was showing a UV rating of 5, high enough for the website of the National Weather Service to recommend use of a sunscreen of at least SPF-30. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But Catherine Civitella, who was hanging out with a friend from college, wasn’t wearing any, as she considers it “toxic.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She formed that opinion from “the internet,” she said, and also by observing people in Florida, where she used to live. There, she noticed that the better people ate, and the more time they spent in the sun, sans sunscreen, the better their skin looked.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“What you put in your body is more important than what you put on your body,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Over on the beach, Maria Turolska, a Dorchester grandmother watching her 18-month-old grandson, both fair-skinned, said she wouldn’t use sunscreen on herself or the little boy, even though his parents wanted her to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Asked if she thought sunscreen could cause cancer, she reflected the widespread skepticism about basically everything these days: “The companies who sell the products want you to think this, but it’s hard to know if it is good or not good.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Alas, as is too often the case, you may be doomed no matter what you do. Studies have found that people who use sunscreen tend to stay out in the sun longer, according to Harvard Health Publishing, “and thus may actually increase their risk of skin cancer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — mRNA, a Nobel-winning technology harnessed by Trump officials to create Covid shots in record time, is becoming a political reject as the nation’s leaders openly embrace vaccine skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Republican lawmakers and federal health officials alike are shunning messenger RNA, a basic building block of biology that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/21/mrna-vaccines-safety-efficacy-senate-committee-probe-myocarditis-adverse-events-covid-shots/"&gt;proved its value during Covid&lt;/a&gt;, and that holds promise for combating the next pandemic and unlocking new cancer treatments. Public health experts and biotech companies are watching in horror as the government cuts its investments in the technology, and as officials like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. foment deep distrust of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed it was canceling &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/28/moderna-flu-vaccine-development-cancelled-by-hhs-mrna-platform-offers-speedy-pandemic-response/"&gt;more than $700 million worth of contracts&lt;/a&gt; with Moderna to develop, test, and license mRNA vaccines for flu strains that could cause future pandemics, including the H5N1 bird flu virus. &lt;/p&gt;

Foods that fall under the category include red and processed meats, sugary drinks, refined grains like white pasta or bread and even tomatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions. Some people also suffer with weight loss a s a result of these symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pizza was classed as anti-inflammatory as it contains cooked tomatoes, which are high in the powerful antioxidant, lycopene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study found colon cancer patients who ate more inflammatory food than 80 per cent of the volunteers had a 36 per cent higher risk of dying from their cancer than those who ate very little.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts, presenting the findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-1ae2bf90-1f2a-11ef-bfef-172cb460e31a" class=""&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, said that, while there is not yet enough evidence to support the anti-inflammatory diet as a recommendation for cancer patients, this may be the case in the near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In the study, scientists tracked 1,625 patients with colon cancer that had spread to the nearby lymph glands, but not beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All volunteers completed food questionnaires about how often they consumed foods that fell under 18 food groups—nine pro-inflammatory and nine anti-inflammatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow-up of three years researchers found that patients in the top 20 per cent of most inflammatory diets had a &lt;span&gt;36 per cent higher risk of dying from their cancer than those who consumed least. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those in the top 20 per cent also had an 87 per cent higher risk of death overall than the bottom 20 per cent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When exercise was taken into account, those who consumed the least inflammatory diet and maintained the highest levels of physical activity had a 63 per cent lower risk of death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Nova system, developed by scientists in Brazil more than a decade ago, splits food into four groups based on the amount of processing it has gone through. Unprocessed foods include fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs and meat. Processed culinary ingredients — which are usually not eaten alone — include oils, butter, sugar and salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ASCO president and top cancer specialist Julie Gralow said the findings suggested 'we need to be essentially prescribing healthy diet and exercise. The combination of the two are synergistic.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Catherine Elliott, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-04a73a20-3f05-11f0-849f-612e04caad7d"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK's director of research, also told MailOnline: 'This study adds to interesting emerging evidence about the role of inflammation in the progression of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need more high-quality research like this to help us uncover more about how our diet influences cancer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'When it comes to food and cancer risk, our overall diet is far more important than any single food or ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A healthy, balanced diet includes eating lots of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, and healthy sources of protein like beans and chicken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cutting down on processed and red meats, and foods high in fat, sugar and salt also helps.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as other research presented at ASCO found colon cancer patients who stuck to an anti-inflammatory diet reduced their risk of the disease spreading or recurring by 38 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, by scientists at Maimonides Medical Centre in New York, tracked the food habits of 796 patients who had been diagnosed with the disease between 2015 and 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found consuming a diet high in ultra-processed foods raised the odds almost two and a half times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultra-processed foods increase inflammation and colon cancer risk while anti-inflammatory diets offer protective benefits,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dietary intervention must play a role in preventing cancer.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer, long considered a disease of old age, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14631623/doctor-five-signs-colon-cancer-rise-Gen-Z-Millennials.html"&gt;increasingly striking people in their 20s, 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt; in a phenomenon that has baffled doctors around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the last 30 years, young diagnoses of the disease have shot up by 80 per cent across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 32,000 cases of colon cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK and 142,000 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 06:59:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOQ0xadnpUbDUzbmpwQy12bU5rSlZQYXdPTWNOVjBYRXRFRkJKQk5rSEh5VzJ1Z2hGT0pUeW9wcVNzcmg3ckhsS3kxUHd5QVBkdktHYkhvSDQ5cURqT19tT3JHWWpVZF9TdVJ3R185TnFJTXJiOEU5eExIVDByV2V0LWh2c2JSOE9sLXRPZjhLZXVlNHNrNHBra1lpWDZibk52dUhUVUF3OGrSAa4BQVVfeXFMTUU0NDBZb1R4U0FXdGFwLXlGUkxsdWliRW5kNC1tOEF3M1d3M2RINHhIWUZ4MmNjaUE0cTViZmdmVGo2SzFIeGN3NHp0b1BPUE1MZWVxOXZNV3FtcXhSbTVUZG01cEs4djBQdldwMDJTOElDRDdwMGYtRmNBUkFlQlg3TUdvOTEySW9OSkYyOXZmMzJZQnNhdzNhVE96WlhEa2Y5RW9RMlZyM29FZl93</guid></item><item><title>每日一词：唯我论-《纽约时报》 | Word of the Day: solipsism - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE9QUmFrSWtuT2ptXzN3dWo5eG9NN2pXMFZocnBDWl9zOENSM3Q0ck45X3dHUW9nS3pwaGF6Qm9NVVYtMFJlU3VTbmhmQmlKMy11SlgwdFEtbERLUE0zcWVhTFZidHo1b2VScWd3WHRIV2NjOEdVN3RiVnBDSEtOU0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The word &lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;solipsism&lt;/strong&gt; has appeared in 12 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Oct. 15 in “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/15/arts/phoenix-springs.html" title=""&gt;A Philosophical Journey With Clicks of a Mouse&lt;/a&gt;” by Christopher Byrd.

Despite its importance, about 20% of people over the age of 60 in the United States and the United Kingdom are deficient in the vitamin. Here are some crucial signs and symptoms of vitamin B12 that one should not ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is vitamin B12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin crucial for several bodily functions. It is naturally present in foods like fish, poultry, eggs, and milk, but absent in most plant-based foods unless fortified.

Cardiovascular diseases account for 17.9 million deaths worldwide in 2023. Diet plays a crucial role in heart health and in reducing the risk of heart disease. A recent study examined the relationship between heart disease and diet and has identified one that benefits the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large study by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the quality of the food matters more than cutting carbs or fat. The findings will be presented at &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition2025.eventscribe.net/index.asp?presTarget=3036520" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;NUTRITION 2025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, which will be held in Orlando this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quality over quantity&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study found that when it comes to protecting the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/health/how-silent-heart-attacks-are-killing-seemingly-fit-indians/articleshow/121410648.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the types of foods one eats may be more important than whether they follow a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. To understand what works in favour of the heart, the researchers followed almost 200,000 people for several decades, and observed that the quality of food consumed matters as much as following a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet. The findings suggested that choosing healthy, high-quality foods is key to protecting the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets have been endorsed by health experts for their potential health benefits, such as weight management and improved blood sugar and cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the impact of these diets on reducing heart disease risk has remained an ongoing debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that what you eat on low-carb or low-fat diets matters just as much as the diet itself. Healthy versions of these diets—those rich in plant-based foods and whole grains—were linked to better heart health outcomes and improved metabolic function. In contrast, low-carb and low-fat diets emphasizing unhealthy foods were associated with a higher risk of heart disease,” said Zhiyuan Wu, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Qi Sun, MD, ScD, at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the link, the researchers analyzed data from three large cohorts: 43,430 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986–2016), 64,164 women in the Nurses’ Health Study (1986–2018), and 92,189 women in the Nurses’ Health Study II (1991–2019). The scientists followed these nearly 200,000 participants for several decades, tracking their dietary habits and whether they developed heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed detailed food frequency questionnaires over time, allowing researchers to score their diets based on the quality of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers classified carbohydrates, fat,s and proteins from foods such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nut,s and legumes as high-quality nutrients, or healthy, while carbohydrates from potatoes and refined grains, as well as saturated fats and proteins from animal-based foods, were categorized as low-quality, or unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than 10,000 participants, the team also examined blood metabolites to understand how diet quality influenced metabolic health. “This approach allowed us to better understand the biological effects of these diets and strengthened our findings,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Take away&lt;br&gt;      &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the participants who followed a healthy low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet had a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease, while those on unhealthy versions saw an increased risk. These healthy diet patterns, whether a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, lowered the risk of developing heart disease by about 15%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;You Clean Your Diet, But What About Your Company? Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati's Powerful Truth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that improving food quality is crucial for improving heart health. Regardless of whether someone follows a low-carbohydrate or low-fat diet, emphasizing whole, minimally processed and plant-based foods and limiting refined grain, sugar, and animal foods, can significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease,” Wu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What to do &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep heart diseases at bay, the researchers suggest incorporating more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes while cutting back on processed meats, refined carbs and sugary foods. Pro tip? Check food labels and be mindful of added low-quality ingredients, such as added sugars in juices and processed snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 01:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxQQmRZZVk0R05wSUNleGR6U1lqNmttMlNRckxzem9TNjF0aENwS05XNWtEbGZuRXRsZkVCbkhGbndJNGpPVVdta25ZQUgxYjJvQVpicHF0ZzJrNnFtaUhDZGZxWFgtWjEzSUlFbDZBclNjY3locXVrZWtzMlVZdTQtU2VKV3VrZnhPUXlOV05HWHdhZWh4TnEtODEtTXBKMU5wa251dXkzZWtOZGJ4WGZhblNkRlNvTlN2ekVnYS1ySk5DbENwcUNxN1JWLURUenJraVRjN19QS1JKV0gydUtpSWNVM242a2ljMDlQdWlLNWc</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多斯普林斯确诊麻疹，公众要求留意症状- KKTV | Measles confirmed in Colorado Springs, public asked to watch for symptoms - KKTV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOTllSeXpSSmk5VTU5QTFCN3BuNTNVa0ZoWjBxZ2FIQ09ncDN2UFowTmx4LU01SS1nTjJYRUljVlR2RDQ1QjZGOWVnb0JqWDNVblVPU2VudUVqVnJEdG1wUzRpMDA3Y1lvalM5RS1wWHh4cFFxU1RBUHZ3cHM3cGlrdkpNRkJUN0VjbTRGMHBaV0FpNGtPMWQyekVMWdIBrwFBVV95cUxPal9wWFc5T1YwVlVqRVBWNjhzbnp4VUMxYnlVaEFqNFRaNDlDMW1CM2gwVlprT1pwb182NFRFX1NMY1lqdDRYeXNEYlhUc2RmeTdWUzZlbHljZ0g0em96Y1pEZ2EtdjV4S2NMeHpjVjFacGhIRnhDRDd3YUhyV3o0T1pGcTRxSkJwLVJvbW5TUGZScGpHREpuMC1qaEpUekd2RHgzWVU1d0h1YUpqSThr?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s okay to mix and match meals. You could repeat a meal in this plan or browse some of our other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/17899/health-condition/diabetic/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes-friendly recipes&lt;/a&gt; for additional inspiration. If you’re making a swap, it’s helpful to know that we did create this meal plan with certain parameters in mind. We aimed for 1,800 calories a day, about 40 grams of carbohydrates per meal and at least 100 grams of protein and 30 grams of fiber per day. If you’re selecting a recipe not in this plan, it may be helpful to choose a meal with a similar nutrition profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely. Each breakfast and lunch is about 400 calories and has 40 grams of carbs, so choosing one option to eat daily would work for this plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one-size-fits-all recommendation for how many carbs a person should eat per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Appetite, body size and activity level can all influence how many carbohydrates you should eat and their impact on blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For more individualized guidance, consider reaching out to a registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_185-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because high blood sugar can increase muscle loss, getting your levels within normal range is the first step to help build muscle and preserve muscle mass. In this meal plan, we incorporate several nutritional strategies to help improve blood sugar levels. When it comes to building muscle, nutrition is just one piece of the puzzle. Incorporating an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-cardio-exercise-better-than-resistance-for-diabetes-8678211" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;exercise routine&lt;/a&gt; is another key strategy. Before you start a new physical activity routine, it may be helpful to discuss your goals with your medical provider. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_186-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_187-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Protein: &lt;/strong&gt;Each day includes at least 106 grams of protein, spread throughout the day to maximize absorption. Research shows that eating more protein earlier in the day can lead to increased muscle growth compared to the more traditional pattern of focusing solely on a high-protein dinner.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Including protein throughout the day, especially when it’s paired with carbohydrate foods, can also promote more stable blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderately-Low Carbohydrate&lt;/strong&gt;: We opted for a moderately-low &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-you-should-be-buying-for-insulin-resistance-8678201" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt; level of about 40% of calories from carbs, which is lower than the 45 to 65% of calories from carbs recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To promote stable blood sugars and prevent spikes, we spread the carbohydrates fairly evenly across the day’s meals and snacks and opted for slowly-digested, high-fiber carbs, such as whole-grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-Fiber&lt;/strong&gt;: Each day provides at least 31 grams of fiber. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Fiber&lt;/a&gt; is a type of indigestible carbohydrate found in fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, nuts and legumes. Because fiber isn’t broken down by the body, it doesn’t raise blood sugar levels like other carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber can also protect your heart and help you feel fuller for longer, which may lead to weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

Far from being a passive storehouse of past experiences, memory is an active, adaptable system influenced by emotion, attention, repetition, and even bodily processes like chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These seven studies highlight how memories can blend together, become overly generalized under stress, or even form in non-neural cells. Together, they offer a clearer picture of the biological and psychological forces that shape our recollections and how those processes can go awry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from the University of California, Los Angeles reveals that when we experience similar events repeatedly—such as parking in the same spot daily—our memories can blend together, especially when one of those events is emotionally charged. This “memory attraction” was strongest in people with higher levels of anxiety and greater physiological reactivity to emotional stimuli. The study challenges the idea that our brains always exaggerate differences between similar memories to avoid confusion. Instead, it found that under certain emotional conditions, similar memories are remembered as being even more alike than they actually were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested this using pairs of similar-looking objects and faces, some paired with startling sounds to induce emotional arousal. Memory for the object colors was later tested, and people often remembered the colors as more similar than they really were—particularly if they were more anxious or had stronger physical responses to the aversive noise. The results suggest that emotional events can cause memories to blend rather than separate, which may help explain how anxiety can lead to overgeneralized fears or confusion between threatening and safe experiences. This blending may sometimes be adaptive, but in other cases, it could contribute to emotional disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; found that emotionally charged memories become more stable and vivid when they are repeated. This effect is driven by the amygdala, a brain region involved in emotional processing. When participants viewed negative images multiple times, their brain formed increasingly consistent patterns of activity in areas involved in memory, such as the prefrontal and parietal cortices. These consistent patterns helped the participants remember emotional images better than neutral ones, even after several viewings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that this memory stabilization depended on the initial response of the amygdala. A strong emotional reaction during the first exposure to an image predicted more consistent brain activity in later repetitions, especially in the superior parietal lobule. This shows that the amygdala not only makes emotional events stand out initially but also strengthens how they are stored with repeated exposure. While this may help us learn from emotionally significant experiences, it also offers insight into why negative memories, such as those in post-traumatic stress disorder, can feel so enduring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chewing on harder substances like wood sticks—as odd as it sounds—may help improve memory, according to a study published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers found that chewing wood increased levels of glutathione, a key antioxidant in the brain, in a region linked to cognitive control. Participants who showed the largest increases in glutathione also performed better on memory tests, particularly those measuring short-term recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study compared participants who chewed gum to those who chewed wooden sticks for five minutes. Only the wood group showed significant increases in brain glutathione levels. While the exact reason remains unclear, one theory is that the physical act of chewing harder materials stimulates blood flow and metabolic processes that support brain health. Though the study was small and involved only young adults, the findings raise intriguing possibilities for how diet and everyday behaviors could influence cognitive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress doesn’t just heighten our memories—it can also make them less accurate. A study published in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt; found that when mice experienced acute stress before learning, their brains formed larger and less specific memory traces. As a result, the animals showed fear responses to safe stimuli that resembled threatening ones, a behavior linked to conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overgeneralization occurred because stress disrupted the normal formation of memory networks in the brain’s amygdala. Typically, memories are encoded in a small, selective group of neurons. But under stress, more neurons than usual were recruited, blurring the boundaries between safe and threatening cues. The researchers traced this effect to the endocannabinoid system, which became overactive under stress and reduced the brain’s ability to limit which neurons were involved in memory formation. Blocking the system’s activity restored memory precision, pointing to potential targets for treating stress-related memory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A surprising study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; suggests that memory isn’t exclusive to brain cells. Researchers found that human kidney and nerve-derived cells could “remember” chemical stimulation patterns in a way similar to neurons. These cells responded more strongly to chemical pulses that were spaced out over time—mirroring the “spaced learning” effect observed in neural memory studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used a glowing protein to track cellular responses, revealing that cells retained information about stimulation patterns for over 24 hours. This effect was driven by molecules like CREB and ERK, which are also critical for memory in neurons. The findings challenge long-standing assumptions about memory being unique to the nervous system and suggest that cells across the body may use similar mechanisms to process and retain information. This could open up new frontiers in medicine, such as training cells to behave in desired ways through patterned stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do memories last for years when the molecules that store them degrade in days? A study published in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; may have the answer. Researchers discovered that a molecule called KIBRA acts as a stabilizing anchor for another enzyme, PKMζ, which helps strengthen synapses—the connections between neurons. This interaction ensures that synapses involved in memory remain strong even as individual proteins are replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers disrupted the KIBRA-PKMζ interaction in mice, the animals lost previously learned spatial memories. This suggests that KIBRA helps maintain long-term memory by continually guiding new PKMζ molecules to the correct synapses. Like replacing the planks of a ship while keeping its shape intact, this system allows memories to persist despite ongoing molecular turnover. The discovery could lead to new treatments for memory disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition&lt;/em&gt; found that memory only directs our attention when we actively hold that memory in mind. Participants in the study were asked to retrieve, suppress, or substitute memories of specific objects associated with scenes. When allowed to freely recall the memories, participants’ eyes were drawn to the remembered objects, even if they weren’t relevant to the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when participants were instructed to suppress or replace those memories, their attention was no longer guided by them—especially in the case of tools, which were easier to suppress than faces. This finding suggests that attention isn’t automatically hijacked by memory. Instead, memory influences attention only when it’s actively engaged. The study sheds light on how people might learn to control distracting or distressing thoughts, with potential applications for managing intrusive memories in conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:07:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOMkZ4bkpRd0FNU3pfb0NRWlQtbHFQb2JIUTRaY3BhY3c1YkkwZzJ3a3JvRzY1X0w0RXpacVBLaU5ZY21Ddk91NERfY3J6VHJJZFFuZ2Y2WGFCMlVya1libnFHT2hCVWVuV0lmYWoxQjBoVFFnWHpEN1dxSG1KRGpDV0hBcWtISk8tTDlueVlkWW1tTEVYV0FTUElYZmJ5SGFQbDZqU19aWDRwMmJsUWlfaQ</guid></item><item><title>药剂师警告影响癌症患者的药物短缺- BBC | Pharmacists warn drug shortage affecting cancer patients - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBJYWRZTXhOYzlNZnp6RGVZeTd5bFZubnlhbnBraVNmR3VnNk1CYTg5SEthWnJFOWFrVlp1WHZNbWRVa3hkcWhGTVRQbTY3Y1d3amI3VHZUbC1lZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFAxaUJHbVF0a1g5aWhSR0NqWHl6bmRtbG93MHBFODJvY2N1ZWpERTlmZGJHTm85d2V3MHQtTzBLYkZnRzU3bGZPcjhxUU10ay0zOWRVaHRyRlhUdUV2OTI4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Pharmacists warn drug shortage affecting cancer patients&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/edda/live/8a943370-3f2a-11f0-90bf-4733dc6be4e0.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images Woman takes a box of medicine from a shelf lined with boxes of medicine.

"devastating impact on people's lives".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They called for a national strategy to tackle the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Alice

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She told the BBC: "Each day I'm trying to balance: what shall I eat, shall I have a more substantial meal, shall I take my supplements and that creates

Following certain diets, like the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet&lt;/a&gt;, is often recommended. This eating plan emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy, while limiting salt, red meat, added sugar and foods containing high levels of saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to drink choices to support blood pressure, tea is a stellar sip. But science appears to suggest that one type of tea rises above the rest when it comes to managing high blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Tea is one of the most popular beverages consumed in the world—second to plain old water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; True teas, which include teas made from the &lt;em&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/em&gt; plant, include black, green, white and oolong. These true teas are distinct from herbal teas, which come from an assortment of other herbs, spices and plants. True teas are a natural source of plant compounds and antioxidants that support many aspects of our health, including our hearts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Among the four varieties of true teas, green tea appears to have the most clinical data suggesting that sipping it regularly is linked to improved blood pressure, making it the top tea choice for hypertension. A meta-analysis evaluating the effects of green tea (via a drink or supplement) on high blood pressure found that green tea was effective in lowering blood pressure levels. Specifically, people benefitted from 3 mmHg and 1 mmHg reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green tea contains catechins, a type of antioxidant that can improve blood vessel function and enhance heart health. They may do this by preventing the narrowing of arteries, improving nitric oxide production, which widens blood vessels, and reducing oxidative stress and inflammation, the researchers point out.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the moderate amount of caffeine found in tea can stimulate a short-term increase in blood flow, potentially contributing to better overall cardiovascular health.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Green tea can be enjoyed simply by steeping green tea leaves in hot water for three to five minutes—remove the tea leaves or bag before sipping. It also tastes great iced. However, there isn’t a specific recommendation for how much tea to drink to support healthy blood pressure. What is clear is that including green tea in your rotation, along with water, can be a good move.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you need a little sweetness in the mix, you can add some sugar, such as a touch of honey. Just be mindful of how much you add, as consuming too much added sugar is linked to elevated blood pressure in certain folks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to what you drink, green tea appears to be one of the best blood-pressure-friendly choices out there. Green tea contains compounds that have important roles in relaxing smooth muscle contraction, enhancing blood vessel dilation, reducing vascular inflammation and combating oxidative stress, all of which are important to manage hypertension.&lt;br&gt;

The review, which systematically examined the scientific literature on post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS), found that symptoms such as anxiety, mood swings, and sleep disturbances sometimes persist long after medication is discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were motivated by growing concerns about the long-term use of antidepressants and the lack of scientific attention paid to what happens when people try to stop. Antidepressants are among the most widely prescribed medications in the world, and a significant number of users stay on them for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although short-term withdrawal symptoms are well-documented, there has been little research into what happens when withdrawal symptoms linger—what some researchers call post-acute withdrawal syndrome. This study aimed to systematically gather and evaluate existing data on how often PAWS occurs, how long it lasts, how severe it is, what factors might influence it, and what treatments are available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the researchers conducted a comprehensive search of major scientific databases, looking for original studies that reported persistent withdrawal symptoms after stopping newer antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. They used a predefined protocol and included a wide range of study types—case reports, observational studies, and surveys—so long as they contained original data. Ultimately, the review included seven studies that met their criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The included studies varied widely in methodology and quality. Some were peer-reviewed analyses of posts on online support forums, while others were clinical case reports or small prospective studies. One of the strongest pieces of evidence came from a large real-world randomized controlled trial in the United Kingdom. That trial followed patients who discontinued antidepressants over several months and found that withdrawal symptoms could persist for up to 39 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of prevalence, one small study provided a rough estimate: in a group of 20 patients who had been prescribed paroxetine for panic disorder and agoraphobia, three individuals (15%) developed PAWS after gradually tapering their medication. This is a limited finding, drawn from a narrow patient population, and cannot be generalized to all antidepressant users. Still, it raises the possibility that persistent withdrawal symptoms are not rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to duration, the studies offered a wide range. Reports of PAWS lasting between one and a half months and nearly 14 years were found. On average, durations spanned from several months to a few years. One study based on online self-reports noted an average symptom duration of over two years. The most commonly reported symptoms included mood swings, anxiety, fatigue, irritability, and sleep difficulties. In some cases, the symptom pattern resembled that of other mental health conditions, making it difficult to distinguish withdrawal from a relapse or a new disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for severity, several studies described PAWS as having a serious impact on quality of life. One case series reported that symptoms such as emotional instability, agitation, and physical discomfort significantly disrupted patients’ daily functioning. In another study, individuals self-identifying as experiencing PAWS reported that their symptoms were severe and persistent, sometimes causing them to seek help in online forums and support groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also explored possible risk factors. Long-term use of paroxetine—a commonly prescribed antidepressant—was repeatedly mentioned as a potential contributor to prolonged withdrawal. Other factors, such as the speed of tapering, did not consistently predict the severity or duration of symptoms. In some cases, people who tapered slowly still experienced long-lasting symptoms, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of treatment, the available options appeared limited and inconclusive. Some individuals found that reinstating the original antidepressant helped alleviate their symptoms, while others did not. A few patients tried other medications like benzodiazepines or beta blockers, with mixed results. One case series reported that cognitive-behavioral therapy seemed to help some patients over the course of several months, but this was based on only a few cases and lacked a control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable findings of this review was how little high-quality research exists on PAWS. Most studies were based on self-reported data from online communities, which, while valuable, cannot provide definitive evidence due to selection bias and lack of medical verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one study used a randomized controlled design, and even that study did not include drugs like paroxetine or venlafaxine, which are known to cause more severe withdrawal symptoms. The authors note that this lack of rigorous research makes it impossible to estimate how common or severe PAWS truly is in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This evidence gap has significant implications for clinical practice. Many doctors may be unaware of PAWS or may misinterpret persistent withdrawal symptoms as a return of the original mental health condition. This can lead to patients being placed back on medication unnecessarily or being diagnosed with a new disorder. Without clearer diagnostic guidelines or validated tools to distinguish PAWS from relapse, clinicians may struggle to provide appropriate care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conclude that much more work is needed to understand PAWS. Larger, well-designed studies are necessary to determine how widespread the problem is and to identify which patients are most at risk. Randomized controlled trials are also needed to test potential treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S204579602500023X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) after stopping antidepressants: a systematic review with meta-narrative synthesis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Andri Rennwald and Michael P.

On the other hand, people are dying because they can't access these life-saving drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A new study by the non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP) looked at access to antibiotics for nearly 1.5 million cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections across eight major low- and middle-income countries, including India, Brazil and South Africa. CRGN bacteria are superbugs resistant to last-line antibiotics - yet only 6.9% of patients received appropriate treatment in the countries studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;India bore the lion's share of CRGN infections and treatment efforts, procuring 80% of the full courses of studied antibiotics but managing to treat only 7.8% of its estimated cases, the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00108-2/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt; in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal reports. (A full drug course of antibiotics refers to the complete set of doses that a patient needs to take over a specific period to fully treat an infection.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Common in water, food, the environment and the human gut, Gram-negative bacteria cause infections such as urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia and food poisoning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They can pose a serious threat to newborns and the elderly alike. Especially vulnerable are hospital patients with weakened immunity, often spreading rapidly in ICUs and proving difficult - and sometimes impossible - to treat. Treating carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is doubly difficult because those bacteria are resistant to some of the most powerful antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"These infections are a daily reality across all age groups," says Dr Abdul Gaffar, infectious disease consultant at Apollo Hospital in India's Chennai city. "We often see patients for whom no antibiotic works - and they die."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The irony is cruel. While the world tries to curb antibiotic overuse, a parallel tragedy plays out quietly in poorer nations: people dying from treatable infections because the right drugs are out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/542d/live/6bda9a50-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Medical staff attend to Covid-positive patients in the ICU ward at the Holy Family hospital on May 06, 2021 in New Delhi, India" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Gram negative bacteria spread rapidly in places like hospital ICUs&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For years, the dominant narrative has been that antibiotics are being overused, but the stark reality is that many people with highly drug-resistant infections in low- and middle-income countries are not getting access to the antibiotics they need," says Dr Jennifer Cohn, GARDP's Global Access Director and senior author of the  study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study examined eight intravenous drugs active against carbapenem-resistant bacteria - ranging from older antibiotics including Colistin to newer ones such as Ceftazidime-avibactam. Of the few available drugs, Tigecycline was the most widely used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers blame the treatment gap on weak health systems and limited access to effective antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For example, only 103,647 full treatment courses were procured of Tigecycline across eight countries - far short of the 1.5 million patients who needed them, the study found. This highlighted a major shortfall in the global response to drug-resistant infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;What prevents patients with drug-resistant infections in India from getting the right antibiotics? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Physicians point to multiple barriers - reaching the right health facility, getting accurate diagnostic tests, and accessing effective drugs. Cost remains a major hurdle, with many of these antibiotics priced far beyond the reach of poorer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58e3/live/de109430-3c64-11f0-bd09-85867b04fa4e.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Universal Images Group via Getty Images Colorized scanning electron micrograph showing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae interacting with a human neutrophil" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A electron micrograph of carbapenem-resistant bacteria&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Those who can afford these antibiotics often overuse them; those who can't, don't get them at all," says Dr Gaffar. "We need a system that ensures access for the poor and prevents misuse by the well-to-do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To improve access, these drugs must be made more affordable. To prevent misuse, stronger regulation is key. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Ideally, every antibiotic prescription in hospitals should require a second sign-off - by an infection specialist or microbiologist," says Dr Gaffar. "Some hospitals do this, but most don't. With the right oversight, regulators can ensure this becomes standard practice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To fix the access problem and curb misuse, both smarter policies and stronger safeguards are essential, say researchers. But access alone won't solve the crisis - the pipeline of new antibiotics is drying up. The decline in antibiotic R&amp;amp;D - and the limited availability of existing drugs - is a global issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;India bears&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63059585" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; one of the world's heaviest burdens of antimicrobial resistance &lt;/a&gt;(AMR), but it may also hold the key to combating it - both at home and globally, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"India is also one of the largest markets for new antibiotics and can successfully advocate for the development and access of new antibiotics," says Dr Cohn. With a strong pharmaceutical base, the country is emerging as a hub for AMR innovation, from &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80vrjkkrero" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;promising new antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to advanced diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Cohn says India can strengthen its antibiotic response by generating local data to better estimate needs and pinpoint gaps in the care pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This would allow for more targeted interventions to improve access to the right drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Innovative models are already emerging - Kerala state, for instance, is using a "hub-and-spoke approach" to support lower-level facilities in managing serious infections. Coordinated or pooled procurement across hospitals or states could also reduce the cost of newer antibiotics, as seen with cancer drug programs, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Without access to the right antibiotics, modern medicine begins to unravel - doctors risk losing the ability to safely perform surgery, treat complications in cancer patients, or manage everyday infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"As an infectious disease doctor, I see appropriate use as one part - but only one part - of access," says Dr Gaffar. "When we get new antibiotics, it's important to save them on one hand - and save them for right patients." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Clearly, the challenge is not just to use antibiotics wisely, but to ensure they reach those who need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 21:34:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5uTEhXQmVfNlVYa0pDWVFBM1V4VzNkZGIwM1dZOXRsNF9GNTM2R1kzU1Nva3BKWWJnWXg0U2lHeS15bHFyRnhTOUh3MjVjc212UnlsUV9lRmVjZ9IBX0FVX3lxTFBRYkZPZXJHTXQzb3ZsdG5FTDhodlNaZU90WXZKSE9qN3FTb0NXOWVaUjh4TVhjRmw5bmwwdndDbVhOTGF2NVJmUW1xUlpjQWl1Zzg3OFctbk1YSWNqU0tB</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，运动可提高结肠癌患者的生存率- KSL新闻 | Exercise boosts survival rates in colon cancer patients, study shows - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUHV1RlhaSkI4UVpHS3JBdGNFdzVpbWN5bHBaVzllbEdPdGR5YzVjQ0w2c1p4S2hHY3FYeE11a3NRMXlwdG5YcVN4Y3dhSmprNFNuQUVWSXJBbXBwRHJ0SzU1aWNIVDBjdnREa2lobVJkREpUakxWMUxxUHpuOHpVX3RXU3hSY0p3cVc3ZzByUlFsWjZqMkQ2ay1tN0o3QU05YzZrUXM1Zw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;KINGSTON, Canada — A three-year exercise program improved survival in colon cancer patients and kept disease at bay, a first-of-its-kind international experiment showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the benefits rivaling some drugs, experts said cancer centers and insurance plans should consider making exercise coaching a new standard of care for colon cancer survivors. Until then, patients can increase their physical activity after treatment, knowing they are doing their part to prevent cancer from coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an extremely exciting study," said Dr. Jeffrey Meyerhardt of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who wasn't involved in the research. It's the first randomized controlled trial to show a reduction in cancer recurrences and improved survival linked to exercise, Meyerhardt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior evidence was based on comparing active people with sedentary people, a type of study that can't prove cause and effect. The new study — conducted in Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States — compared people who were randomly selected for an exercise program with those who instead received an educational booklet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is about as high a quality of evidence as you can get," said Dr. Julie Gralow, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. "I love this study because it's something I've been promoting but with less strong evidence for a long time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were featured Sunday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in Chicago and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Academic research groups in Canada, Australia and the U.K. funded the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'We were just astounded'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed 889 patients with treatable colon cancer who had completed chemotherapy. Half were given information promoting fitness and nutrition. The others worked with a coach, meeting every two weeks for a year, then monthly for the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coaches helped participants find ways to increase their physical activity. Many people, including Terri Swain-Collins, chose to walk for about 45 minutes several times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is something I could do for myself to make me feel better," said Swain-Collins, 62, of Kingston, Ontario. Regular contact with a friendly coach kept her motivated and accountable, she said. "I wouldn't want to go there and say, 'I didn't do anything,' so I was always doing stuff and making sure I got it done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eight years, participants in the structured exercise program not only became more active than those in the control group but also experienced 28% fewer cancers and 37% fewer deaths from any cause. There were more muscle strains and other similar problems in the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we saw the results, we were just astounded," said study co-author Dr. Christopher Booth, a cancer doctor at Kingston Health Sciences Centre in Kingston, Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'Exercise causes improvements in survival'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise programs can be offered for several thousand dollars per patient, Booth said, "a remarkably affordable intervention that will make people feel better, have fewer cancer recurrences and help them live longer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers collected blood from participants and will look for clues tying exercise to cancer prevention, whether through insulin processing or building up the immune system or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swain-Collins' coaching program ended, but she is still exercising. She listens to music while she walks in the countryside near her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of behavior change can be achieved when people believe in the benefits, when they find ways to make it fun and when there's a social component, said paper co-author Kerry Courneya, who studies exercise and cancer at the University of Alberta. The new evidence will give cancer patients a reason to stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now we can say definitively exercise causes improvements in survival," Courneya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 20:59:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPUHV1RlhaSkI4UVpHS3JBdGNFdzVpbWN5bHBaVzllbEdPdGR5YzVjQ0w2c1p4S2hHY3FYeE11a3NRMXlwdG5YcVN4Y3dhSmprNFNuQUVWSXJBbXBwRHJ0SzU1aWNIVDBjdnREa2lobVJkREpUakxWMUxxUHpuOHpVX3RXU3hSY0p3cVc3ZzByUlFsWjZqMkQ2ay1tN0o3QU05YzZrUXM1Zw</guid></item><item><title>威尔士首次给予乳腺癌患者Capivasertib - BBC | Capivasertib given to breast cancer patients in Wales for first time - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9SWkhpQ3FkQXQxZ2w0TjN1ODRRZHJ5R3JKXzZFT3daMllWYjVLQ2RNUXNyQjNIVURpZ0xwemRxbFdxVXVXWXNheDVaVy1TakdqUS1XRzNmWTNxQdIBX0FVX3lxTFB3Yy1LNUtlMXVlOVVEUHBUdDhoVDJLbmVENno0MG5rd2lVZDdoR2tIOTJkNThHOEdLNE5DeHhZc1FxMXc5RjA4MmRKRkNjUlREWnNfdmFSMjRkS0ZVMUZ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Cancer drug which could 'double survival time' rolled out &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0e36/live/f33796b0-3def-11f0-be17-23b2ca25de0b.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Gwen, who has short blonde hair, is looking at the camera and smiling.

It can remain in the environment as well as human tissue for years, even decades, before being cleared out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from Boston University, wrote: 'Despite the growing concerns about the toxicity of PFAS, specific interventions to reduce PFAS levels in the body are limited.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-025-01165-8"&gt;Environmental Health&lt;/a&gt; in March, &lt;span&gt;looked at 72 adult men ages 18 to 65 with detectable levels of PFAS in their blood.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, 42 consumed a one-gram supplement of oat beta-glucan, a type of fiber naturally found in oats, mushrooms and seeds, three times a day, about 10 minutes before a meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other 30 participants consumed a rice-based control supplement instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers collected blood samples from each participant before and after the four-week experiment. Each test looked for 17 forms of PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At baseline, 70 percent of participants had 11 of 17 forms of PFAS in their blood, and five forms were in every participant's blood.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study found men who took the fiber supplement saw an eight percent decrease in perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), which are considered two of the most dangerous forms of PFAS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFOA and PFOS are synthetic chemicals used in firefighting foam, non-stick cookware and stain repellents to make them water and stain resistant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFOA is considered a Group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), meaning it causes cancer in animals. PFOS, meanwhile, is a Group 2 carcinogen, suggesting it may cause cancer in animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both chemicals are also thought to to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals, meaning they imitate the body's hormones and interfere with the production of - and response to - natural hormones like estrogen and testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This increases the risk of developing hormone-sensitive cancers like breast and ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers believe dietary fiber forms a gel that stips cells lining the gut from absorbing PFAS. This is because that gel stops bile acids, which help break down fats, from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, that excess bile gets excreted through feces.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS is thought to latch on to bile and travel through the gut, so fiber may help flush forever chemicals out of the body before they can linger and cause lasting damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using blood tests, the researchers found men in the study had eight percent less PFOS and PFOA in four weeks than they did before the study (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There is no level of safe exposure to forever chemicals and they have been linked to multiple cancers, asthma, fertility problems, obesity, birth defects, diabetes and autism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers cautioned not all fiber gets rid of PFAS, and more research is needed to determine if other types have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to ridding the body of PFAS, fiber is also well known for adding weight to stools and making them easier to pass, reducing the risk of constipation and promoting regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoother stools spend less time lingering in the colon, reducing the risk of harmful contaminants causing inflammation and triggering cells to grow uncontrollably. This lowers the likelihood of developing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, 90 percent of Americans don't get the recommended 22 to 34 grams of fiber every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the new study, with the main one being that PFAS can live in the body for two to seven years, so a four-week experiment was not enough time to properly assess the relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also noted consuming higher levels of fiber may be necessary to reduce PFAS levels in the long term.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

However, if that multi doesn’t come with a dose of vitamin D, your doctor might recommend adding another pill to your routine. Known as the "sunshine vitamin," vitamin D is something most of us aren't getting enough of, and if you're wondering what time of day you should take it, we're here with the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Is Vitamin D?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/roxana-ehsani/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Roxana Ehsani, M.S., RD, CSSD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Roxana Ehsani, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, explains that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is one of four fat-soluble vitamins (A, E and K are the others). Our bodies make vitamin D after being exposed to the sun, and we can also get it through our diet. It plays “many important roles in our body,” adds Ehsani. These include &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplements-for-immune-health-8781386" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:supporting your immune system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;supporting your immune system&lt;/a&gt;, muscle and nerve function, your body’s ability to absorb calcium and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though vitamin D is critical for overall health, research suggests that an estimated 25% of Americans are deficient in it. This could be because there are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:few food sources of vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;few food sources of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, and many people don’t see sunshine during winter, live in regions with limited sunlight, and/or keep their skin covered while al fresco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The average older adult’s recommended Daily Value of vitamin D is 20 micrograms, which is equal to 800 international units (IU). For reference, one egg and a 3-ounce can of tuna each have above 1 mcg, 3 ounces of sockeye salmon delivers around 12 mcg, and 3 ounces of trout offers around 14 mcg. Unless you’re taking a spoonful of cod liver oil (34 mcg) or eating salmon or trout daily, it can be challenging to meet that mark through food alone, since most food sources of vitamin D offer small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the U.S., people get most of their &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary vitamin D from fortified milk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;dietary vitamin D from fortified milk&lt;/a&gt;, which contains around 100 IU per 8-ounce serving. But you'd need to drink a quart or more of milk daily to reach the DV—and milk consumption has been declining in recent years, a factor that some experts cite when discussing increased vitamin D deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s why many people take a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-d-supplements-8656101" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D supplement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt;. However, you want to make sure not only that you’re taking the right amount but also that your body is absorbing it properly. Read along to learn when to take your vitamin D supplement and what factors you should consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Morning vs. Evening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We’ll cut to the chase: According to the current scientific consensus, our experts agree that it doesn’t matter what time of the day you take your vitamin D supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people find it handy to take supplements in the morning before the day sweeps them away. Others like to store them in a drawer near the kitchen cleaning supplies to pop after tidying up after dinner. It shouldn’t make a substantial difference in absorption rates whether you swing to one side or the other, although it’s easiest to remember if you pick one time and stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Factors to Consider When Deciding to Supplement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are many factors to consider when taking any supplement, not just a vitamin D supplement; here's what you should keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Health Conditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:several conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;several conditions&lt;/a&gt; can influence an individual's vitamin D levels (or needs). These include osteoporosis or osteopenia, depression, kidney or liver disease and having a family history of neurological conditions, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.northshore.org/apps/findadoctor/physicians/david-jeremy-davidson" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Davidson, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;David Davidson, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, it’s especially important for “people with absorption issues, like inflammatory bowel disease or post-gastric bypass surgery” to work with their doctors to dial in their dose and receive personalized guidance about when to take vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Body size can also alter absorbency and dosing, so be sure to ask your doctor for an individual recommendation before you set off to shop for supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you notice any nausea, constipation, noticeable appetite shifts or other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adverse symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;adverse symptoms&lt;/a&gt; after taking your supplement, be sure to chat with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Individual Preference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Regardless of why you’re including a vitamin D supplement in your regimen, it’s important to consider your routine. It’s difficult to reap the health benefits of vitamin D if you forget to take it most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people do well with “habit stacking” or pairing the routine of taking vitamin D with something else they do daily on autopilot. Keep this in mind as you consider when to take your supplements.  Ehsani shows how to put this into practice: “If you always brush your teeth in the morning after breakfast, for instance, can you place your vitamin D supplements next to your toothbrush to remind you to take it each day?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As with any new medication or supplement, it’s important to check with a health care professional to determine the best time for you. As a general rule, though, “the ‘best’ time is what works best for you,” Ehsani says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;With or Without Meals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The timing of when to take the vitamin D supplement shouldn’t matter, but it should be taken with food,” Davidson says. “Because it’s a fat-soluble vitamin, food, specifically healthy fats, will help with the absorption of vitamin D.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, if you tend to have almond-butter toast each morning, “consider taking it with that meal, as almond butter contains healthy fats,” Ehsani advises. Or, if you like to serve dinner with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275930/pear-gorgonzola-walnut-salad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:side salad topped with a handful of walnuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;side salad topped with a handful of walnuts&lt;/a&gt; and drizzled with a vinaigrette, take your vitamin D before you sit down to dig in. You could also choose to take your vitamin D with a glass of whole milk or a yogurt drink—you'll get the addition of calcium from the dairy and the vitamin D will help your body absorb the calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It may be impractical for you to take it with meals if you eat a majority of your meals away from home and can’t realistically carry the vitamin D supplement with you everywhere you go,” Ehsani acknowledges. So, if that’s not a realistic proposition, tell a health care professional about your schedule and when you think it might better fit, and ask for their runner-up recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Type of Vitamin D&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are two types of vitamin D: D2 and D3. UV-grown plants, fungi and fortified foods deliver D2, while we get D3 from sunlight and animal-based ingredients. While both are important and beneficial, &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-supplement-8620841" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D3 is more bioavailable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;vitamin D3 is more bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; than vitamin D2. This means that your body uses vitamin D3 more efficiently, so you might need a higher dose of vitamin D2 to achieve the same effects as you might with a supplement that includes just D3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Before starting any new supplement regimen, talk to a health care professional about the best form of vitamin D for you. And if you already take a vitamin D supplement, confirm with them that you’re taking the right form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:7 Things You Should Look for When Buying a Supplement, According to Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;7 Things You Should Look for When Buying a Supplement, According to Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The best time to take a vitamin D supplement is when it fits well into your day—and when you can remember to take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When choosing a vitamin D supplement, consider opting for vitamin D3 over D2 so your body can use it more efficiently. Additionally, Ehsani and Davidson confirm that, ideally, you should take your vitamin D supplement with a meal that contains fat to help with absorption. For instance, if you like to take vitamin D first thing in the morning, well before you typically eat breakfast, or prefer to pop your supplements just before bed, think about doing so with a handful of nuts or a spoonful of nut butter, Ehsani says. That way, you’ll enjoy two wellness wins in one: better vitamin D absorption and all the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:health benefits of nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;health benefits of nuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-not-to-take-dietitian-11735821" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:5 Supplements You Shouldn't Be Taking, According to a Dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;5 Supplements You Shouldn't Be Taking, According to a Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-for-maximum-absorption-11743667" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBoOGVBYTVsOVlvZGhoWVpmRU53UWZycmFfS0VOLWxqX0RXNEp4TmVLc2p6N2FrLUJNTHIxS1hzQW83Tk5BZ3lua3dsYk1xNlY4Zmg0dUpiMTJjeXhvZTBTak1CcXlPMndCbkZmSDRDek5faWZJSmgxSWNVOWxrelE</guid></item><item><title>根据健康专家的说法，服用维生素D以最大限度吸收的最佳时间- EatingWell | The Best Time to Take Vitamin D for Maximum Absorption, According to Health Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOSTBNUDQ0YmZXM3cwRFpGQU13QkJuMi1ibWU3ZG1rNFRJYUlFRmV2a3JpVlRTMW1sRWhRVzJmNExaWlFDT1hxanR4STRBVGpkdjVrU0RIUTFFcFdKaEg0cHdiWE5TbjE2Q2J3VWVTeVpvajlDYkNTRHhDMUFQeEtYMHZBamZ1RVF2ZXVqOGZLSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to the supplement aisle, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024998/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-take-a-multivitamin-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;multivitamins&lt;/a&gt;, omega-3s and probiotics might score the most real estate on the shelf. However, if that multi doesn’t come with a dose of vitamin D, your doctor might recommend adding another pill to your routine. Known as the "sunshine vitamin," vitamin D is something most of us aren't getting enough of, and if you're wondering what time of day you should take it, we're here with the answer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/roxana-ehsani/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, explains that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is one of four fat-soluble vitamins (A, E and K are the others). Our bodies make vitamin D after being exposed to the sun, and we can also get it through our diet. It plays “many important roles in our body,” adds Ehsani. These include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-supplements-for-immune-health-8781386" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting your immune system&lt;/a&gt;, muscle and nerve function, your body’s ability to absorb calcium and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though vitamin D is critical for overall health, research suggests that an estimated 25% of Americans are deficient in it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This could be because there are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;few food sources of vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, and many people don’t see sunshine during winter, live in regions with limited sunlight, and/or keep their skin covered while al fresco. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The average older adult’s recommended Daily Value of vitamin D is 20 micrograms, which is equal to 800 international units (IU).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For reference, one egg and a 3-ounce can of tuna each have above 1 mcg, 3 ounces of sockeye salmon delivers around 12 mcg, and 3 ounces of trout offers around 14 mcg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unless you’re taking a spoonful of cod liver oil (34 mcg) or eating salmon or trout daily, it can be challenging to meet that mark through food alone, since most food sources of vitamin D offer small amounts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the U.S., people get most of their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/2024-vitamin-d-recommendations-8659678" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary vitamin D from fortified milk&lt;/a&gt;, which contains around 100 IU per 8-ounce serving. But you'd need to drink a quart or more of milk daily to reach the DV—and milk consumption has been declining in recent years, a factor that some experts cite when discussing increased vitamin D deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s why many people take a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-d-supplements-8656101" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D supplement&lt;/a&gt;. However, you want to make sure not only that you’re taking the right amount but also that your body is absorbing it properly. Read along to learn when to take your vitamin D supplement and what factors you should consider. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’ll cut to the chase: According to the current scientific consensus, our experts agree that it doesn’t matter what time of the day you take your vitamin D supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people find it handy to take supplements in the morning before the day sweeps them away. Others like to store them in a drawer near the kitchen cleaning supplies to pop after tidying up after dinner. It shouldn’t make a substantial difference in absorption rates whether you swing to one side or the other, although it’s easiest to remember if you pick one time and stick with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-factors-to-consider-when-deciding-to-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Factors to Consider When Deciding to Supplement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many factors to consider when taking any supplement, not just a vitamin D supplement; here's what you should keep in mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Health Conditions &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; First, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/conditions-when-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement-8576496" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;several conditions&lt;/a&gt; can influence an individual's vitamin D levels (or needs). These include osteoporosis or osteopenia, depression, kidney or liver disease and having a family history of neurological conditions, to name a few. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://www.northshore.org/apps/findadoctor/physicians/david-jeremy-davidson" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;David Davidson, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, it’s especially important for “people with absorption issues, like inflammatory bowel disease or post-gastric bypass surgery” to work with their doctors to dial in their dose and receive personalized guidance about when to take vitamin D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Body size can also alter absorbency and dosing, so be sure to ask your doctor for an individual recommendation before you set off to shop for supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you notice any nausea, constipation, noticeable appetite shifts or other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-vitamin-d-per-day-is-too-much-8605769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adverse symptoms&lt;/a&gt; after taking your supplement, be sure to chat with your doctor.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Individual Preference &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless of why you’re including a vitamin D supplement in your regimen, it’s important to consider your routine. It’s difficult to reap the health benefits of vitamin D if you forget to take it most of the time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people do well with “habit stacking” or pairing the routine of taking vitamin D with something else they do daily on autopilot. Keep this in mind as you consider when to take your supplements.  Ehsani shows how to put this into practice: “If you always brush your teeth in the morning after breakfast, for instance, can you place your vitamin D supplements next to your toothbrush to remind you to take it each day?”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with any new medication or supplement, it’s important to check with a health care professional to determine the best time for you. As a general rule, though, “the ‘best’ time is what works best for you,” Ehsani says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; With or Without Meals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The timing of when to take the vitamin D supplement shouldn’t matter, but it should be taken with food,” Davidson says. “Because it’s a fat-soluble vitamin, food, specifically healthy fats, will help with the absorption of vitamin D.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, if you tend to have almond-butter toast each morning, “consider taking it with that meal, as almond butter contains healthy fats,” Ehsani advises. Or, if you like to serve dinner with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/275930/pear-gorgonzola-walnut-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;side salad topped with a handful of walnuts&lt;/a&gt; and drizzled with a vinaigrette, take your vitamin D before you sit down to dig in. You could also choose to take your vitamin D with a glass of whole milk or a yogurt drink—you'll get the addition of calcium from the dairy and the vitamin D will help your body absorb the calcium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It may be impractical for you to take it with meals if you eat a majority of your meals away from home and can’t realistically carry the vitamin D supplement with you everywhere you go,” Ehsani acknowledges. So, if that’s not a realistic proposition, tell a health care professional about your schedule and when you think it might better fit, and ask for their runner-up recommendation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Type of Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are two types of vitamin D: D2 and D3. UV-grown plants, fungi and fortified foods deliver D2, while we get D3 from sunlight and animal-based ingredients. While both are important and beneficial, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d-supplement-8620841" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D3 is more bioavailable&lt;/a&gt; than vitamin D2.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that your body uses vitamin D3 more efficiently, so you might need a higher dose of vitamin D2 to achieve the same effects as you might with a supplement that includes just D3. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before starting any new supplement regimen, talk to a health care professional about the best form of vitamin D for you. And if you already take a vitamin D supplement, confirm with them that you’re taking the right form. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best time to take a vitamin D supplement is when it fits well into your day—and when you can remember to take it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing a vitamin D supplement, consider opting for vitamin D3 over D2 so your body can use it more efficiently. Additionally, Ehsani and Davidson confirm that, ideally, you should take your vitamin D supplement with a meal that contains fat to help with absorption. For instance, if you like to take vitamin D first thing in the morning, well before you typically eat breakfast, or prefer to pop your supplements just before bed, think about doing so with a handful of nuts or a spoonful of nut butter, Ehsani says. That way, you’ll enjoy two wellness wins in one: better vitamin D absorption and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;all the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits of nuts&lt;/a&gt;.

However, one cardiologist shares that it's easy for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; to overlook these symptoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Patients may dismiss these symptoms as 'just tension,' but cardiologists are taught to evaluate unexplained discomfort above the waist with concern, particularly in high-risk patients," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/robert-segal-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Robert Segal, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Robert Segal, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a board-certified cardiologist, the founder of Manhattan Cardiology, Medical Offices of Manhattan and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.labfinder.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:labfinder.com.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;labfinder.com.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've talked a lot about heart attacks, but Dr. Ni says jaw and neck pain may also suggest other cardiovascular issues. "There are other heart conditions that can also induce neck and jaw pain, including heart valve issues and heart rhythm problems," Dr. Ni says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also may not be a heart issue at all. "Just because someone has risk indicators or pain in a typical region does not imply a cardiac cause," Dr. Segal says. "Proper cardiac screening is crucial. Jaw and neck pain can also be caused by muscle strain, tooth infections, and joint or spinal disorders."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/everyday-item-linked-over-300k-142500310.html" data-ylk="slk:This Everyday Item Is Linked to Over 300K Heart Disease Deaths, According to Doctors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;This Everyday Item Is Linked to Over 300K Heart Disease Deaths, According to Doctors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why Pain in the Neck and Jaw Can Signal Heart Trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the pain is related to heart disease or attacks, there's no structural or physical issue in the neck and jaw. Instead, the mind is misreading signals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Our internal organs transmit 'pain' via the autonomic nervous system," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vitalsolution.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bradley Serwer, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Bradley Serwer, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, an interventional cardiologist and chief medical officer at VitalSolution, an &lt;a href="http://www.ingenovishealth.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ingenovis Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ingenovis Health&lt;/a&gt; company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Serwer explains that the autonomic nervous system plays a vital role in numerous functions, including blood pressure and heart rate regulation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"When the heart is injured, the autonomic nervous system transmits signals to the brain indicating an injury," Dr. Serwer adds. "The pain is interpreted as referred pain.

"Think of it like a leaking pipe—you might notice a subtle drip, or jaw [and] neck pain, before the pipe bursts. Or you could have a heart attack.

It could be a sign of a heart attack. "This is especially true for those at an increased risk for having a heart attack—those with diabetes, known coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking or family history," Dr. Serwer says, adding it's better to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Kee explains that doctors will treat suspected heart attacks immediately, potentially using:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Aspirin to reduce clotting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nitroglycerin (a medication) to ease chest discomfort&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oxygen and IV medications&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cardiac catheterization and angioplasty (a minimally invasive procedure that can open arteries)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Stents or bypass surgery, depending on the severity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Kee says the outlook depends on numerous factors, including how quickly treatment begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Early recognition of warning signs—even the atypical ones like jaw or neck pain—can drastically improve outcomes," he explains.

&lt;p&gt;According to studies, girls who get their &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/04/09/health/ive-had-my-period-for-1000-days-a-cute-clue-explains-why/"&gt;menstrual cycles&lt;/a&gt; at a young age are more susceptible to long-term health problems. As a result, one mom is trying to prevent her young daughter’s body from maturing too soon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/29/early-menarche-jama-study-average-age-first-period/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt;, over the past 55 years, young girls in the US have been getting their &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/27/health/your-heavy-period-could-be-a-sign-of-this-blood-disorder/"&gt;periods&lt;/a&gt; earlier and earlier. Nowadays, the average age is 11 years and nine months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As if that age was startling enough, 16% of girls are getting their cycle before they even celebrate their 11th birthday. &lt;/p&gt;

100vw, 885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Nowadays, the average age for a young girl to get her first period is 11 years and nine months.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;zakalinka – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concerning part is that, according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5052133/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, females who start their period at this young age have a 23% higher risk of developing different cancers — like breast, endometrial and ovarian — later on in life. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the increased risk of being diagnosed with serious illnesses down the road — another concern about early puberty is that young girls are forced to endure the emotional and physical toll periods can have before their brains and bodies are fully developed.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“…modern teens have to deal with painful periods, the risk of getting pregnant and sometimes actually getting pregnant well before their brains and bodies are actually mature enough,” Elena Bridgers, a mom of two and a wellness and mental health writer, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJR2aKioYaw/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent Instagram reel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of this alarming news, moms like Rebecca Kinderman are trying to delay their daughter’s first period by following a holistic lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I believe that if we can delay this part of ‘growing up,’ especially when their brains are not developed enough to be able to handle everything that they could be exposed to online, we are allowing our girls to stay young for longer,” Kinderman told &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/moms-are-trying-delay-daughters-first-period-experts-say-theyre-right-2075902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Newsweek.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 36-year-old posted a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI98Is-TP4G/?igsh=ZjM5MmYwdmh3Z2Ez" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;viral Instagram reel&lt;/a&gt; where she explained her thought process in helping her daughter live a long, healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Believing household toxins and poor diets are contributing factors to early periods, Kinderman stressed in her post that feeding your family whole foods without seed oils and artificial ingredients is major. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And in the era of parents raising “iPad kids,” the mom also stressed the importance of removing kids from their tech devices and encouraging them to get outside and play.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And it seems that Kinderman might have a point — especially regarding diets and lifestyle choices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that that is very reflective of the obesity epidemic that we are seeing,” Aviva Sopher, a professor of pediatrics at Columbia University, Irving Medical Center, told Stat News. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“To me, this is concerning as well, this kind of confluence of obesity and earlier puberty and more irregular cycles,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

Part of this relationship was mediated by irritability and impulsivity. The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.200"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood abuse refers to harmful or threatening treatment of a child, which can be physical, emotional, or sexual, or can involve neglect. Physical abuse includes hitting, shaking, or otherwise causing physical harm. Emotional abuse involves behaviors that harm a child’s self-worth, such as constant criticism, rejection, or humiliation. Sexual abuse includes any sexual activity with a child, including inappropriate touching, exposure, or exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neglect is the failure to meet a child’s basic needs, such as food, shelter, medical care, education, or emotional support. Abuse can seriously affect a child’s development, leading to long-term mental health issues like anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and difficulties in relationships. Brain development may also be impacted, especially in areas related to stress response and emotion regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Zhengyi Liu and his colleagues aimed to explore the links between childhood abuse experiences and addictive behaviors. They hypothesized that childhood abuse could make an individual more prone to addictive behaviors both directly and indirectly by increasing irritability and impulsivity. The study particularly focused on smoking, drinking, and internet addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 1,601 high school students from a vocational school in Zhejiang Province, China. Students were in grades 10 and 11. Of the participants, 757 were girls. Their ages ranged from 15 to 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed assessments of childhood abuse (the Childhood Abuse Questionnaire), impulsivity (the Dual-Mode of Self-Control Scale), irritability (the Brief Irritability Scale), substance use (the Global School-based Student Health Survey), and internet addiction (the Internet Addiction Disorder Diagnostic Scale for middle school students).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that girls tended to be slightly more impulsive and irritable than boys, but boys smoked and drank more. There were no significant gender differences in childhood abuse experiences or the severity of internet addiction symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, participants reporting more severe childhood abuse experiences tended to score higher on measures of irritability and impulsivity. They were also more likely to display symptoms of internet addiction, to smoke more tobacco, and to drink more alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested a statistical model proposing that childhood abuse increases impulsivity and irritability, which in turn increase the likelihood of engaging in addictive behaviors. The results supported this model, but also indicated that impulsivity and irritability do not fully explain the link between childhood abuse and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on how early adversity may shape vulnerability to addiction. However, it is important to note that all data were self-reported, and childhood abuse data were retrospective (i.e., based on participants’ memories). This leaves room for reporting bias and memory inaccuracies to have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.03.200"&gt;The association between childhood abuse and addictive behaviors in adolescents: Understanding the role of impulsivity and irritability&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Zhengyi Liu, Yunyi Xiao, Yingying Ye, Yifan Li, Zijian He, Nanshu Peng, and Xiao Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 16:06:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNV2dsdm5lcFhaOE0xMGdlUkRwMEhiYnhJbm1GUlY3ck53MnZqVmlERTgxTnVhWmx1cGU3bkRkYzlWeHlrNWpKTFZkTDVQS1lrZnBsbC1hMmhEcktqdzU0bjlMX210ZEQ4RTdQM2dfc3lxem1ack5lYkk0dURPb0lDZklGS2xYX0NRZjJfLThrMzhKVk5RaW9RN2FvUVRxeUdJeHVZVlhFWm1OZw</guid></item><item><title>丹尼斯·奥斯汀（ Denise Austin ）解决顽固性腹部脂肪的5个习惯-吃这个不是那个 | Denise Austin’s 5 Habits to Tackle Stubborn Belly Fat - Eat This Not That</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE5SNkRrZXMtcVhnNHl6dGxhaDF6dWRJeHFkd2ZkYjY3R19CYTZIUkFURFR4MmhJTUFOd1FlUzhFWDhpRG1ITVNncnFHd05LSHM4VHBVZFliSEk1WFBHaW5pdk1BOUMteXNlY0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/ways-to-maximize-walking-for-weight-loss/" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t appear to be an intense workout, it could be your key to belly fat loss.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“Walking for just 30 minutes per day is all you need to reap the benefits of physical activity,” Denise writes on &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.deniseaustin.com/blog/walk-off-belly-fat-" target="_blank"&gt;her website&lt;/a&gt;. “It can be as effective (if not more so) than jogging. While walking, you can burn fat, boost your metabolism, and/or lose weight. Exactly how much you get out of it will depend on the intensity of your walks and what other healthy habits you’re practicing during the rest of your time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise even has a workout program specifically dedicated to walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My 4-Week Walking Challenge encourages you to walk every day for 30 minutes, along with quick, mini-workouts to tone up your whole body—it’s one of my most popular challenges, so join today for free!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to increase the intensity of your walks to speed up the fat burn, consider performing bodyweight exercises, wearing a rucksack or ankle weights, switching up the terrain, and including inclines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Aim for 30 minutes five days a week… stick with it and you will feel great!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain workouts specifically fire up your abdominal region and address stubborn belly fat.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In general, belly fat wraps around your organs like the liver and belly, and is called &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-increase-visceral-fat-burn-while-walking/" target="_blank"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; (as opposed to subcutaneous fat, which is closer to your skin),” Denise explains. “To tackle this visceral fat, you need to add some targeted moves to your workouts. You will want to add core moves that both elongate and constrict the abdominal muscles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise suggests giving her 6-Minute Amazing Abs Pilates Workout and 10-Minute Belly Blasting Workout a shot. Once you progress, check out Denise’s Shape, Strengthen and Sculpt Kit, which features many targeted exercises for the belly, upper, and lower body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Eat more eggs, avocados and walnuts—all are high in protein and healthy fats—and add more cruciferous veggies to your diet, such as kale, cauliflower and broccoli… studies have shown that these vegetables are rich in antioxidants and can decrease inflammation,” she says.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She writes on &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.deniseaustin.com/blog/blast-belly-fat-with-yoga" target="_blank"&gt;her blog&lt;/a&gt;, “Yoga is especially helpful for targeting the belly and belly fat—yoga moves target tone the abs without sit ups, and works all parts of the midsection—the abs, waistline, and the deep fat within the belly area. So try this yoga workout and watch the belly fat melt away!”&lt;/p&gt;

I have requested a transfer from my job so we can get out of this podunk shithole ASAP. Do you have any advice for dealing with the rude quips from the local yokels until then?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7dl001i3b76u0kl90ff@published"&gt;If you really don’t care about these opinions, stay committed to that attitude. Let them talk. Either ignore them or tell them that you don’t care. Know that they’re wrong and instead of worrying yourself about the principle of the way they’re treating you and your girlfriend, focus on the practice that will complicate your lives the least. You could even offer solidarity: “I’m slutty, too” or, “I know, isn’t she amazing?” This may put the target on you for mockery as well, but again, who cares what these people think?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="133" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7ge001j3b768z1sd7we@published"&gt;You could also take the drag-queen route and read them right back. Try clap-backs along the lines of: “Wow, you must really have nothing going on in your life that you’re concerned about my girlfriend’s teenage sex life,” or “You’re a little overly concerned with a teen’s sex life, don’t you think?,” or “Jealous, much?” Of course, this would serve to escalate the situation while dragging you down to their level. Because this could cause further complications and on the principle that it would actively bring more ugliness into the world, I’d tread lightly but you could do it. Many people won’t let things go beyond words and you will soon never see these people again so shutting them up aggressively might feel good and not be very complicated at all, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7m2001l3b76uaftnr0b@published"&gt;I have an embarrassing penis problem. I am 66 now. I have always been a “grower”—that is, I add a lot of length and girth when I get hard. As I have aged—and now moved to a hot climate—my ball sack has just grown larger. I thought it was a myth, but apparently not.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag7ou001m3b767b3kup0s@published"&gt;Now when I sit the wrong way, or exercise the wrong way, my penis pretty much disappears into the ball sack. And it feels terrible. I end up adjusting myself all the time. I can move my penis to one side and my ball sack to the other, but if I move around more it hurts. I’ve tried several types of underwear: pouches, boxer briefs, and regular boxers. But nothing helps for long. Anything that holds my genital area ends up smushing (technical term) my penis. Can your experts think of anything to fix this? Cock rings work, but I can’t wear them all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

You seem to be describing a condition known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16291-buried-penis"&gt;buried penis&lt;/a&gt;. There are some non-invasive treatments for it like weight loss and steroid creams for those who experience buried penis as a result of tight skin around the penis, but for some, surgery may be the only effective treatment option. Sometimes this surgery can come in the form of a tummy tuck or suction lipectomy, which removes fat from around the genital region. There is also the possibility of removing scrotal tissue when that is the culprit of buried penis, as it is in your case. It’s unclear what’s causing your discomfort, but that’s not uncommon with buried penis and sometimes is the result of &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lichen-sclerosus/symptoms-causes/syc-20374448"&gt;lichen sclerosus&lt;/a&gt;, a condition that can result in thin, patchy, and/or discolored skin that is typically treated with ointment.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag801001q3b76r4rry2br@published"&gt;I ran your letter by my go-to urologist source, Dr. Charles Welliver, director of men’s health at Albany Medical College. In an email, he told me that it “seems a little too convenient to blame this on just the weather,” and indeed buried penis is typically caused by weight gain or “some sort of intrascrotal process like a hydrocele making the scrotum grow bigger and envelop the penis.” The doctor’s recommendation? See a doctor. Granted, this may seem daunting given your embarrassment, but doctors see issues like this all the time. It’s worth sucking it up to ameliorate your discomfort and, yes, potential embarrassment moving forward. If telling one person could save you years of grief, that seems like a no-brainer trade off.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag86e001s3b76so8kfi2r@published"&gt;My wife and I have been married for more than 20 years. We love each other and are extremely happy together. Recently, she went through some health and work issues, and our sex life waned, but now that both are resolved, it’s picked back up again.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag896001t3b76bvqiu3eq@published"&gt;We’ve had many conversations over the years about our shared belief in ethical nonmonogamy and giving it a try. They’ve escalated lately. About a decade ago, with my permission, she slept with a longtime acquaintance. Until recently, that was it. In the past few months, it became apparent a mutual friend was interested in her, and with our spark back, I encouraged her to go for it if she wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8c0001u3b76g9xd26v8@published"&gt;She did, and she loved the experience. I’m happy for her! She’s now encouraging me to try it, too. She’s particularly excited about it because she’s the only sexual partner I’ve ever had (I grew up in a strict household, and in a religion that instilled a lot of shame, and I was a shy, unconfident, late bloomer). She keeps telling me: “I don’t want to be the only person you ever have sex with!” Great, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8ev001v3b766v0zixrt@published"&gt;The problem is, while I’m eager to try it, I have no idea where to start. Because she loves me and is attracted to me, she doesn’t realize there is a big opportunity gap between us. She is beautiful, outgoing, witty, charming, and easily attracts people. As I’ve aged, I’ve gained weight and lost hair. She regularly is thought to be 15 years younger, while I definitely look my age. Plus, I’m just naturally more shy and reserved. She tells me often that I’m a kind, thoughtful person and that I’m good in bed, but I do not exude (sexual) energy like she does, and do not have acquaintances coming up to me asking if we’re open and can we sleep together.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8jj001w3b76v6pbgech@published"&gt;I know this is going to require work on my part to get out of my comfort zone and put myself out there. But it seems likely to me that if I do this, it’s probably going to start with someone I don’t know yet (which she’s OK with). So, I’m wondering if you can suggest some apps or websites (or just give me any useful insight) on how to meet some like-minded people? We’ve discussed, down the road, perhaps trying threesomes or partner-swapping, but for now, I’m just trying to figure out how to get my “body count” to two.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8rw001z3b76bypdvp4k@published"&gt;Some of what you’re worried about is easy enough to work on. If you aren’t exercising regularly, that’s a great place to start. It can help with your mental as well as physical health and affect your body composition. Working out may also give you the kind of glow that many find attractive as it silently telegraphs health. In addition to the gains, you may find your confidence lifted, which can also attract people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="238" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8up00203b76824ix9z4@published"&gt;I think that’s key here: You need a boost of that kind of self-esteem. It can be learned via a fake-it-till-you-make-it approach. Even if you don’t feel confident, carry yourself like you are and you may start to be naturally, once you feel the effects of this disposition. Confidence begets confidence. Also, you’re a guy, which means you have a bit more wiggle room in terms of looking your age and still being considered attractive. That’s male privilege, and while beauty standards are changing for men, things like crows feet and thinning hair are not held against men’s appearance to the extent that they are women’s. It’s not fair, but it’s the way things are at the moment. If nothing else, tuck that in your back pocket and use it so as not to be hard on yourself. The other side of the gender norms is that men are still largely expected to be the pursuers of sex. That’s changing, too, but it could explain a bit as to why your wife is being hit on when you are not. Sure, she may be hot, but in your letter, I see you repeatedly talking down to yourself. Realism is important and self-awareness is a rare commodity, but negative self-talk can get in the way of you trying to move forward on your ENM path here. I’m just trying to dismantle some of the blockades you have set up.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag8xi00213b76bntrbwto@published"&gt;Feeld is the go-to app for ethical non-monogamy. If you have kinks, consider Fetlife (though you’re likely to have luck on Feeld, as well, given the amount of kinksters on it). Tinder has a meat-market reputation, so that may work for you, and sites like OKCupid and &lt;a href="http://match.com"&gt;match.com&lt;/a&gt; have been around for so long that they cover ENM bases as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbag90e00223b7685eelnrl@published"&gt;You could also try threesomes or partner-swapping as opposed to finding new partners on your own. Your wife is more experienced, and you claim she’s hotter, so you might have better luck looking for extra partners together. Group sex isn’t for everyone, and there are plenty of ENM couples that play separately, but unless you have good reasons for doing it that way (beyond the tit-for-tat reason that she’s already experienced it solo and so should you), I recommend cruising together. On apps like Feeld, you can link profiles with your partner so that the interested can check both of you out to see what they’re getting. You may also consider swingers clubs/groups or sex clubs. These spaces can be overwhelming, sure, but they can also allow you to feel out vibes and kind of get in the ENM headspace. You don’t have to have sex when you go—you can just hang out and watch. That might be the easiest way for you to dip your toe in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbbagu3d002a3b76edzfpw6t@published"&gt;I don’t have a problem with porn, but I’m realizing I have a problem with the way my husband watches it. Last week, I asked him to play some music from his phone by pairing it with the TV, and a porn video sprang up. I immediately lurched to cover our 8-year-old’s eyes, but the incident stuck with me. I think he’s watching way more porn than I know, and probably lying to me about it. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/08/porn-addiction-signs-husband-watching-advice.html"&gt;What should I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Of these people, more than half reported suffering from rectal bleeding, a warning sign of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Timothy Cannon, the medical oncologist who led the research, told DailyMail.com that the results were higher than what doctors would expect in the general population and warranted further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that any long-distance runners experiencing warning signs of colon cancer, such as rectal bleeding, should get tested for the disease, regardless of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was observational so it is not clear if distance running raises the risk of if other lifestyle factors like diet play a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Cannon suggested it could be because running long periods causes blood to be directed away from the colon to the legs, raising the risk of cell death and damaging mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is colon cancer patient Phil Decker in January 2025, pictured running a marathon with Alecia Allen. He was getting ready to run a marathon when he was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Radwah Oda never thought she could get cancer as we was in 'excellent health' at the time of her diagnosis at age 33. She was working out five times a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: '&lt;span&gt;As a colon cancer oncologist, I had seen several patients die of colon cancer that were in their 30s that ran ultramarathons, which were 50km or higher runs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We did this study because we were concerned that these runners were/are diverting all their blood flow to their legs during runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And [then are having] infarcts in their colon, and a lot of cell turnover; the cells die and then turn over very quickly [meaning] there may be more risk of cancer causing mutations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infarcts are area of dead tissue caused by a loss of blood supply. When blood flow is blocked or severely reduced —usually by a clot, embolism, or narrowed vessels — the affected tissue doesn't get the oxygen and nutrients it needs, and it dies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is just the latest explanation being put forward by scientists to explain the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761627/colon-cancer-rates-linked-alcohol-smoking-young-people.html"&gt;surge in colon cancer cases among those under 50 years old&lt;/a&gt;, with those born in the 1980s now having double the risk of being diagnosed with the cancer compared to their parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether long-distance running may also be linked to a higher risk of other cancers that are rising in young people, like in the pancreas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many young colon cancer patients &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13784061/marathon-runner-pancreas-cancer-deadly-symptoms-ignored-harmless.html"&gt;have been shocked by their diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, saying they are young, healthy and - they thought - were doing everything right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients include Laurie Koshers, a vegetarian who ran every day, but was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 44 years, and marathon runner John B. Johnson, who was diagnosed at 35 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest study was carried out in memory of two patients - Josh Wadlington and Spencer 'Trigg' Robbins - who both battled colon cancer despite running marathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was presented at ASCO 2025 in Chicago, Illinois, the world's largest gathering of cancer researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lee Rawlinson, who previously ran marathons, learned that his grandfather had pancreatic cancer and he carries a 'dodgy gene'. It is not clear whether there is a link between long-distance running and other early-onset cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Holly Shawyer, 35, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year despite being in peak shape and training for a marathon. It is not clear whether there is a link between long-distance running and other early-onset cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'I have always been pretty health conscious – watching what I eat and regularly exercising. I rarely got sick, maybe once every few years I would get a stomach bug,' Ms Shawyer said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients aged 35 to 50 years old who were ultramarathon runners were recruited for the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was defined as people who had completed at least two marathons of 50 kilometers (31 miles) or more, or five marathons of at least 42km (26.2miles) or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had inflammatory bowel disease or other conditions linked to colon cancer were excluded from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, participants had an average age of 42 years, 55 percent were female and they reported running around 32 to 64km (20 to 40 miles) every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between October 2022 and December 2024, patients underwent a colonoscopy - a screening for colon cancer where a flexible tube with a small camera on the end is placed into the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cannon said they were still investigating other factors that may have put them at risk of developing pre-cancerous polyps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preliminary results had shown that runners ate at least five energy bars and also consumed gels daily - which are highly processed foods, with foods in this category previously being linked to a higher risk of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Laurie Koshers (left) was diagnosed with colon cancer after 'doing everything right'. She is a vegetarian and also would run every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Colon cancer cases are rising among under 50 year olds, even as they fall in older age groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Cannon added: 'I think that i would get a colonoscopy if you have blood from your stool, even if you are not at the age yet where colonoscopies are approved - or at least i would ask your doctor for one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think bleeding from the rectum in runners is dismissed because it is a known entity, runners colitis is known, and it hasn't been known to be associated with cancer, so it is often dismissed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But my hope is that, with more awareness, people who run long distance and have bleeding will go get a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In our study, most of the people who were having advanced adenomas were having blood in their stools.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6574107/Colorectal-cancer-rates-deaths-soaring-especially-young-adults.html"&gt;estimates over 154,000 Americans will be stuck by colorectal cancer this year, including about 20,000 under 50.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is roughly in line with two decades ago, the disease is rising sharply in younger groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6306175/Bowel-cancer-rates-rise-younger-people-Europe.html"&gt;rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:49:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQUWh0T3ppbnhacXEtZldVTVlKOG4wYUNBdFN0R2diNUhCRHkwNjF4Z19Dc2I3aEVXQ29pSURUOEVtek9OcTVDdW1LTTRjb1FFdFNGUG83QXZwbzFsbGhuQ3d0clg2TlAtLVdDdTVuYXNkR29FQUVKQ2tyOHlxMlU2c1dTa1hHQnhaTHZZUGdMRko</guid></item><item><title>与心脏损伤重大风险直接相关的任何形式的大麻使用- Earth.com | Cannabis use in any form directly linked to significant risk of heart damage - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOYlNhN1RlQWtVUTZPOHZLSzRhbXBISlNqTkk4czJnNnFaVTZIdk1teU1iZ3FtSE44QlJjbW1yeG1nazNsd29oOVN2ZXNMaTVVUVhkYnR4cEJGR2NETnItYWdNM0xCSVdqTzlFdlZfQkY0djdmTXRKVVlBaEswOHdHdklnbElzVVN4b3NJLWpvaWdOMUVwOGZ5aVlOMU9PMWxTa3Vta0tPNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marijuana has long been debated as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. Some people view it as a benign stress-reliever with fewer hazards than tobacco products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from a recent study challenges that assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was led by first author Leila Mohammadi, MD, PhD, and senior author Matthew L. Springer, PhD, at the &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of California, San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-users-and-heart-damage"&gt;Cannabis users and heart damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study followed 55 participants who were already cannabis users or individuals who did not use any nicotine &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dopamine-changes-from-cannabis-last-at-least-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt;. Each cannabis user had a habit of consuming it at least three times a week for at least one year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group included smokers who averaged around 10 years of use and those who used &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/tetrahydrocannabinol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tetrahydrocannabinol&lt;/a&gt; in edible form with around five years of use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nonsmoking control group showed healthier cardiovascular indicators than any of the cannabis-using groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers uncovered decreased blood vessel function in participants who either smoked marijuana or took edibles containing the psychoactive compound in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cannabis-sativa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found vascular function in those using either type of cannabis was roughly half that of nonusers. This was linked to higher chances of &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/blood-heart-circulation/endothelial-dysfunction.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;endothelial dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, which refers to impaired operations of the cells lining blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cannabis-linked-blood-vessel-damage"&gt;Cannabis-linked blood vessel damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When blood vessels lose flexibility or responsiveness, that can heighten the likelihood of conditions such as heart attacks and hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some previous &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.cir.103.23.2805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; have also associated marijuana use with possible triggers for cardiovascular complications. The current study adds more data to consider for those who routinely depend on cannabis for relaxation or pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential link between endothelial dysfunction and cannabis use raises concerns about early development of vascular disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition involves impaired nitric oxide production and reduced elasticity in the arteries, both of which influence how well blood moves around the body. If this process falters too much, people may face a spike in heart-related &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risks&lt;/a&gt; over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-smoking-cannabis-and-heart-health"&gt;Smoking cannabis and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators noticed that marijuana smokers had distinct changes in their blood serum that were harmful to cells lining blood vessels. Those taking edibles, however, did not display the same harmful shift in serum properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might indicate that the act of burning and inhaling &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-potency-cannabis-use-linked-to-epigenetic-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cannabis&lt;/a&gt; smoke triggers certain biochemical pathways not activated by ingesting THC in food or beverage form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both methods still resulted in diminished vessel function, but the underlying mechanisms appeared to vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery opens the door for closer evaluation of how inhaled cannabis influences nitric oxide and other chemicals in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have tried to pinpoint how THC might harm vessels, but these findings suggest there are yet-to-be-mapped pathways involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They highlight the need for more research to understand how different routes of use impact the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eating-cannabis-and-heart-health"&gt;Eating cannabis and heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12412838/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; have drawn parallels between marijuana smoking and tobacco use when it comes to cardiovascular strain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both involve inhaling combusted materials that may generate oxidizing particles and other toxins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that while chronic users of edibles also showed diminished endothelial function, it did not seem tied to changes in blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cbd-reduces-the-unwanted-side-effects-of-thc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;THC&lt;/a&gt; may cause adverse cardiovascular effects through interactions with cannabinoid receptors in the heart or blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edible users might be experiencing those effects in a way that bypasses the bloodstream’s immediate signaling changes linked to smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also hint that inhalation may carry a bigger immediate impact on serum factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-all-of-this-mean"&gt;What does all of this mean?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people view &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-cannabis-helped-patients-feel-better-for-a-full-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;edibles&lt;/a&gt; as a safer alternative to smoking. Edibles do avoid the dangers of inhaling combusted matter, yet the overall vascular function among both smoking and non-smoking users in the study was still notably reduced compared to nonusers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a cautionary sign for anyone who feels that avoiding smoke means avoiding all serious health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical or recreational users might want to stay alert to these issues. Some individuals turn to cannabis for relief from pain or anxiety, but this research indicates a need for awareness about cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider could be wise, especially for those with a family history of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-heart-health-cannabis-and-the-future"&gt;Heart health, cannabis, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team noted that the specific mechanisms behind THC’s effect on blood vessels remain somewhat unclear. They observed that smoking marijuana affects blood vessel function in ways distinct from ingesting THC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means new research should aim to pin down which components of smoke, vapor, or other byproducts may be most harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are likely to explore whether occasional marijuana use carries the same risk as chronic use. More data on dosage levels and individual differences could help the medical community develop more precise guidelines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current work sets the stage for larger population studies that can track cardiovascular parameters over longer timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular health is a lifelong matter. This research shows that both edible users and smokers should keep an eye on how cannabis might impact their heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caution makes sense until medical professionals reach a clearer understanding of how best to reduce any risks linked to routine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2834540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:16:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOYlNhN1RlQWtVUTZPOHZLSzRhbXBISlNqTkk4czJnNnFaVTZIdk1teU1iZ3FtSE44QlJjbW1yeG1nazNsd29oOVN2ZXNMaTVVUVhkYnR4cEJGR2NETnItYWdNM0xCSVdqTzlFdlZfQkY0djdmTXRKVVlBaEswOHdHdklnbElzVVN4b3NJLWpvaWdOMUVwOGZ5aVlOMU9PMWxTa3Vta0tPNA</guid></item><item><title>铁天然存在于这10种食物中-印度时报 | Iron is naturally present in these 10 foods - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;amp-story-grid-layer class="recircular" id="rcontent" template="vertical"&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;&lt;p class="mid-heading"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You may also like&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc3 pa"&gt;​10 reasons why spinach deserves a spot ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="rc5 pa"&gt;9 fast and easy mini-workouts to reduce ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/amp-story-grid-layer&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 15:04:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在埃及石棺中发现的银河系最古老的描绘- Earth.com | Oldest depiction of the Milky Way galaxy discovered in an Egyptian sarcophagus - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeFBJXzRiUDBZU2ZNYUxrZF9Rc2V1emY1M2VRaEVDMWs4Q1c3QlVlTUNQdFVGaHJLRE9saDVHOGo2ckNQUDlNNTJ3dmhocVlwUzdzOFdlUDJfbWRQUVNhYnMyTDZRay1vT0FwZVZCNm9jSzJQTW1nYmxzc0dlVjdySngzRTlOcWdMM3NkdnB3SEZlOUZKV21KU1NFbWcyNk1zUzM3MjdHbkNSWnZ2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oldest known depiction of our galaxy may come from a coffin that once held an ancient Egyptian priestess. Thousands of years ago, early observers around the Nile watched the night sky and recorded what they saw in ways that still surprise people today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their cosmic understanding went beyond casual observation, given the care they took in mapping stars and planetary positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These efforts shaped myths and religious beliefs that included powerful deities who represented the sky itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of such a depiction was proposed by &lt;a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/about-us/structure-and-governance/our-people/our-staff/or-graur" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Or Grauer&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href="https://www.port.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Portsmouth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explored museum collections for images of Nut, the Egyptian goddess of the sky, and found an unexpected detail on a coffin belonging to &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/83189270/Inner_coffin_of_Nesitaudjatakhet_from_the_collection_of_the_National_Museum_of_the_Republic_of_Tatarstan_Kazan_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nesitaudjatakhet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-egyptians-and-the-night-sky"&gt;Egyptians and the night sky&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ancient &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-high-tech-machinery-used-to-build-egypt-step-pyramid-djoser-study-claims/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; society thrived along the banks of the Nile, where seasonal floods influenced farming and daily life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night sky became a reference point for these rhythms, prompting the Egyptians to begin making &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-high-tech-machinery-used-to-build-egypt-step-pyramid-djoser-study-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;detailed observations&lt;/a&gt; of celestial patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priests tracked the rising and setting of stars to guide religious events, marking out constellations with local symbolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Astrophysicists and historians now suggest these same patterns shaped how the Egyptians understood their gods and the wider firmament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one striking coffin scene, &lt;a href="https://egyptianmuseum.org/deities-nut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nut’s figure&lt;/a&gt; arches over the earth, with an undulating curve traced from her fingertips to her toes. This dark curve cuts through the stars on her body, leaving some above and others below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A comparison with a photograph of the Milky Way shows the striking similarity between the wavy curve that runs through Nut’s body and the wavy curve created by the dark nebulae that make up the Great Rift,” said Dr. Grauer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to match &lt;a href="https://epod.usra.edu/blog/2024/04/the-great-rift.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the Great Rift&lt;/a&gt;, which is the band of interstellar dust that seems to bisect the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deepening-our-view-of-nut"&gt;Deepening our view of nut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Nut was often pictured as the entire Egyptian night sky, she did not always show a visible reference to the Milky Way. Many coffin artworks depict her naked or clothed but typically avoid that wavy band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feature in Nesitaudjatakhet’s coffin stands out because the curve is thick, dark, and divides her starry form. This is why some experts now consider it the earliest known artistic sign of the Milky Way in &lt;a href="https://fisher.library.utoronto.ca/fisher-blog/iconography-ancient-egyptian-funerary-objects-cartonnage-papyri-fisher" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Egyptian funeral iconography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Nut’s representation involved the path of the Sun and stars as she swallowed them at dusk and birthed them at dawn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egyptians also described the sky in texts that link it to a “Winding Waterway,” which some believe could be a name for our galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faint dust clouds that form the Great Rift are easy to notice under dark skies, so it is possible that ancient astronomers saw this feature splitting the glow of the Milky Way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they specifically labeled it as a cosmic river or associated it with Nut’s form remains a point of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-connecting-religion-and-astronomy"&gt;Connecting religion and astronomy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge carved and painted into these burial items reflects a society that saw religion and astronomy as one connected system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blue-lotus-unraveling-an-egyptian-psychedelic-mystery/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; night sky lore spanned the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, with deities representing cosmic forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nut’s cosmic curve is just another reminder of how carefully people watched the heavens in earlier times. Today, it serves as both a historical clue and a symbol of human curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/01084423/egyptian-sarcophagus_Ramesses-VI_oldest-milky-way-drawing_credit-Francis-Dzikowski_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/01084430/egyptian-sarcophagus_Ramesses-VI_oldest-milky-way-drawing_credit-Francis-Dzikowski_1s.webp" alt="The Book of the Day from the tomb of Ramesses VI (KV 09).

In classical Greece, it was called the “Galaxy,” rooted in legends of milk sprayed across the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-egyptian-mummies-still-carry-their-original-scents/"&gt;Egyptian&lt;/a&gt; approach put the galaxy within a goddess’s silhouette, linking cosmic wonder to stories of birth and rebirth. This bond between visual art and faith explains why coffins became a central place for these images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts point to the 21st and 22nd Dynasties as times of vibrant coffin designs, combining older funerary customs with new artistic ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burial sets often had layers, each with religious scenes that showed various deities and protective formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person like Nesitaudjatakhet, who served as a musician and chantress, held a high rank in temple society. The images around her final resting place likely merged theology with cosmic symbolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-egypt-and-the-ancient-night-sky"&gt;Egypt and the ancient night sky&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who research early astronomy continue to wonder if Egyptian priests fully understood the galaxy’s shape or only noticed its brighter patches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of the Great Rift suggests they recognized distinct zones in the band of light crossing the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of whether the “&lt;a href="https://grahamhancock.com/phorum/read.php?1,71210,71223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Winding Waterway&lt;/a&gt;” refers to that dark split within the glowing path. Though we may never know their exact thoughts, the coffin detail hints that they observed far more than modern assumptions might suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without telescopes, ancient stargazers formed complex ideas about &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-ever-recorded-planetary-engulfment-event-captured-by-webb/"&gt;planetary&lt;/a&gt; alignments and seasonal changes. They excelled at linking natural cycles to myths, weaving them into every aspect of life and the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nut’s starry figure and that striking curve demonstrate how ancient theology and observation blended into a single story. It is an unusual view of the sky that still holds our attention today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://dds.sciengine.com/cfs/files/pdfs/view/1440-2807/CF0632CF1DDF408F8BA140B965EF95B6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:51:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOeFBJXzRiUDBZU2ZNYUxrZF9Rc2V1emY1M2VRaEVDMWs4Q1c3QlVlTUNQdFVGaHJLRE9saDVHOGo2ckNQUDlNNTJ3dmhocVlwUzdzOFdlUDJfbWRQUVNhYnMyTDZRay1vT0FwZVZCNm9jSzJQTW1nYmxzc0dlVjdySngzRTlOcWdMM3NkdnB3SEZlOUZKV21KU1NFbWcyNk1zUzM3MjdHbkNSWnZ2</guid></item><item><title>试验发现，锻炼“优于药物”以阻止癌症在治疗后复发-《卫报》 | Exercise ‘better than drugs’ to stop cancer returning after treatment, trial finds - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPWVJLTjlVX0VpYWgtanFSWm8xRE9XSmdmS1F6bGdCY0lDamsxRGQ3SWJNaG1TVFZUVVVLbmtJOTlzQUVqUFlWZTNBbWFaMGJoTmRKNHd6TzlmTnJtdjVNYjZ2aV8wcDNkeGdDejJrSXJ3b080ZGx5NlhVZEl2dFBPSjFvUVdGWDBpSFFhakxjMmJNZmY2OTYzUUdJLTZUbHM3bFppVTZPRnBQWXlxc0w2NmpTRGtsXzVlTlFSZkQ0c0Y?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exercise can reduce the risk of cancer patients dying by a third, stop tumours coming back and is even more effective than drugs, according to the results of a landmark trial that could transform health guidelines worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For decades, doctors have recommended adopting a healthy lifestyle to lower the risk of developing cancer.

I would have retitled it Better than a Drug, because you don’t have all the side-effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s the same magnitude of benefit of many drugs that get approved for this kind of magnitude of benefit – 28% decreased risk of occurrence, 37% decreased risk of death. Drugs get approved for less than that, and they’re expensive and they’re toxic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When I started three decades ago it was still the era where we’d be gentle and say, don’t overdo yourself when you’re on chemo. We’ve reversed that,” she added. “I would say [exercise is] better than a drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b8ceac9a-c41c-473e-93c4-4acb9557946f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Bowel cancer rising among under-50s worldwide, research finds","elementId":"b8ceac9a-c41c-473e-93c4-4acb9557946f","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/11/bowel-cancer-rising-under-50s-worldwide-research"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the trial, researchers enrolled 889 colon cancer patients between 2009 and 2023.

Their weekly target was the equivalent of three to four walks of between 45 and 60 minutes, but patients could choose how they got more active. Some went kayaking or skiing, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;After five years, patients in the exercise group had a 28% lower risk of recurrent or new cancers than those in the other group. After eight years, the same patients also had a 37% lower risk of dying than those just handed the healthy lifestyle booklet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“After completing surgery and chemotherapy, about 30% of patients with high-risk stage two and stage three colon cancer will eventually experience recurrence of their disease,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Christopher Booth, of Queen’s University in Kingston, Canada. “As oncologists, one of the most common questions we get asked by patients is ‘what else can I do to improve my outcome?’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These results now provide us with a clear answer: an exercise programme that includes a personal trainer will reduce the risk of recurrent or new cancer, make you feel better and help you live longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Charles Swanton, the chief clinician of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, which funded the UK arm of the study, said: “This fascinating study captures the power of exercise to transform people’s health and boost their chances of surviving cancer after treatment.

My advice to cancer patients is to speak to your doctor before taking on any new physical activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings are likely to change global practice, with doctors worldwide urged to discuss exercise regimens with their patients following treatment, oncologists in Chicago said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While this study followed only colon cancer patients, Gralow said there was no reason to think the findings would not be applicable across other cancers. Booth said trials for other cancers would be needed, but added that data from this study suggested there were lower breast and prostate cancer occurrences in the exercise group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Exercise as an intervention is a no-brainer and should be implemented broadly,” said Dr Pamela Kunz, of Yale School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Prof Sir Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, said it was “really exciting” that tailored exercise after treatment could be “life-changing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These landmark findings suggest that focused steps to exercise, from walks to workouts, could help turbocharge the body’s ability to prevent cancer returning after treatment and help save more lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Being more active can have significant benefits in helping maintain a healthy weight, strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation and lift mood – and it’s now really encouraging to see that exercise really could have the power to help more people survive cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:51:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPWVJLTjlVX0VpYWgtanFSWm8xRE9XSmdmS1F6bGdCY0lDamsxRGQ3SWJNaG1TVFZUVVVLbmtJOTlzQUVqUFlWZTNBbWFaMGJoTmRKNHd6TzlmTnJtdjVNYjZ2aV8wcDNkeGdDejJrSXJ3b080ZGx5NlhVZEl2dFBPSjFvUVdGWDBpSFFhakxjMmJNZmY2OTYzUUdJLTZUbHM3bFppVTZPRnBQWXlxc0w2NmpTRGtsXzVlTlFSZkQ0c0Y</guid></item><item><title>坚果、植物油中的ω-6脂肪酸能降低心脏病和糖尿病的风险吗？ -今日医学新闻 | Can omega-6 fatty acids in nuts, vegetable oils lower heart disease and diabetes risk? - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOOGx5R3B0ai1sTjlWWll5cEdxbFR2dWc5aVJfTDRBN0F3TU9IMVhhekhQa0tJNjRPX1lLbEF3LVpEdTFwa2s4ZndRdXRzb1pHTFlNSG9TTFNWTzdjV0pjVXIxaWl3T2JPa3dLSUFUOG1DT0d6VUdpa0xVTU9fMzR0YjlWUXItT05nUFEwUXN0UXFsazZ1NGZZTDk0andGU3JwelVKaDczbjNVRVNHVENwaUVCOV9hczFNVGFF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg" alt="The bottom of a vegetable oil bottle casts a shadow on a flat surface" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fomega-6-fatty-acids-nuts-vegetable-oils-may-lower-heart-disease-diabetes-risk&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F06%2Foil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Seed%20oils%3A%20Omega-6%20fatty%20acids%20may%20lower%20diabetes%2C%20heart%20disease%20risk" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/oil-bottle-shadow-1296x728-header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Higher linoleic acid levels may help lower heart disease and diabetes risk, a new study finds.

Maki, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Some caution is needed because this was not an intervention study, so we cannot say that this association is cause and effect,” Maki added. “We can only say that we found the opposite of what would be predicted if linoleic acid was having a pro-inflammatory effect.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, researchers found these same participants with more linoleic acid in their serum also experienced more favorable levels of BMI and biomarkers of glucose homeostasis, or even blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Higher BMI, along with higher fasting levels of glucose and insulin are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have shown that a higher circulating level of linoleic acid is associated with lower risk for developing type 2 diabetes.

Foods that naturally contain linoleic acid — like &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/sunflower-seeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;sunflower seeds&lt;/a&gt;, walnuts, &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/278340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt;, eggs, and fish — come packaged with fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals, not just isolated fats.” &lt;br&gt;— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consider linoleic and other fatty acids to be an accessory or an assistant in helping bring out the food’s flavor, such as in a saute, marinade, sauce, or a vehicle to add spice, herbs, or enhance mouthfeel and moisture,” she continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic low-grade inflammation can be exacerbated from poor dietary sources of linoleic acid, so those that have conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome do need to be aware of overall patterns, quality of ingredients, and amounts,” Richard added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3 vs. omega-6 ratio important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to note the necessary and optimal balance of the ratio of omega-6 to &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; (is) something a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) can assist in assessing.”&lt;br&gt;— Monique Richard, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:34:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOOGx5R3B0ai1sTjlWWll5cEdxbFR2dWc5aVJfTDRBN0F3TU9IMVhhekhQa0tJNjRPX1lLbEF3LVpEdTFwa2s4ZndRdXRzb1pHTFlNSG9TTFNWTzdjV0pjVXIxaWl3T2JPa3dLSUFUOG1DT0d6VUdpa0xVTU9fMzR0YjlWUXItT05nUFEwUXN0UXFsazZ1NGZZTDk0andGU3JwelVKaDczbjNVRVNHVENwaUVCOV9hczFNVGFF</guid></item><item><title>3小时的睡眠，没有疲劳？科学家揭开天然短睡眠者的秘密-印度时报 | 3 hours of sleep and no fatigue?

From doctors to wellness influencers, the message has echoed across platforms, backed by countless studies linking insufficient sleep to heart disease, diabetes, depression, cognitive decline, and early mortality. But what if this universal advice doesn’t apply to everyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter a rare, fascinating group of people who are redefining what it means to be well-rested. Known as natural short sleepers, these individuals thrive on just three to four hours of sleep per night — and not because they’re skimping on rest. Rather, they are biologically wired to require less of it. These are not productivity-obsessed workaholics running on caffeine and willpower. They are genetically programmed to complete all the vital functions of sleep in a fraction of the time, waking up refreshed, alert, and high-functioning without any of the side effects typical of sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This condition, called Familial Natural Short Sleep (FNSS), is exceedingly rare and largely misunderstood, but recent breakthroughs in neuroscience and genetics are helping demystify it. From groundbreaking studies to the potential for revolutionizing sleep medicine, the science of short sleepers is gaining momentum — and it may just unlock answers to one of biology’s greatest enigmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How some people function perfectly on 3.5 hours of sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural short sleepers are often highly energetic, productive, and resistant to common health issues associated with insufficient sleep. According to neuroscientist Dr. Ying-Hui Fu at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), these individuals don’t experience the cognitive fog, irritability, or health decline that plagues typical short sleepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural short sleep isn’t a result of lifestyle, stress, or overcommitment. It’s genetically driven and often runs in families, hence the term familial in FNSS. In most cases, these individuals sleep between 3.5 to 5 hours a night — every night — and report feeling completely rested and mentally sharp. They don't rely on naps or stimulants to compensate. Their bodies simply don't seem to need more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though estimates vary, only about 1% of the population may possess this trait, making it an incredibly rare but fascinating subject of study in the world of sleep research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why some people need just 4 hours of sleep: The genetic blueprint&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific journey into FNSS began with Dr. Fu’s landmark study published in Science in 2009, where her team identified a mutation in the DEC2 gene in members of a family who consistently slept for just 4 to 6 hours a night without adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Dr. Fu and colleagues have discovered five key mutations across four different genes involved in regulating sleep, including DEC2, NPSR1, ADRB1, and most recently, SIK3. Each mutation alters the sleep architecture of the brain, effectively condensing the sleep process without compromising its restorative benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 study published in Neuron, researchers used genetically engineered mice to test the impact of the SIK3 mutation. The mice exhibited significantly reduced sleep times without observable physical or cognitive impairment. These findings strongly suggest that FNSS is not just a fluke — it’s a biologically viable alternative to conventional sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While each mutation alone only slightly reduces sleep needs, stacking them together may have cumulative effects, a hypothesis currently under investigation. If confirmed, this could pave the way to replicating FNSS-like effects safely in individuals with sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can short sleep genes treat insomnia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of this research extend far beyond curiosity. Sleep disorders like insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea affect hundreds of millions globally. Understanding the biological mechanisms that allow short sleepers to thrive on less sleep could revolutionize sleep medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fu’s team believes that, in the future, therapies could be developed to mimic or activate these gene mutations in people suffering from insomnia or irregular sleep cycles. This would allow them to achieve restorative sleep in shorter durations, potentially improving quality of life for those who cannot sustain long sleep hours due to work schedules, health issues, or neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Clifford Saper, a renowned sleep scientist at Harvard Medical School, supports this line of inquiry, emphasizing that we are only scratching the surface of sleep genetics. “If we can understand how to safely ‘accelerate’ the sleep process, we could one day provide relief to millions who struggle with poor sleep,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The dark side of sleeping less (if you’re not genetically wired)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the allure of being able to function optimally on minimal sleep, it’s crucial to underscore that Short Sleep Syndrome is not something you can train yourself into. Most people who sleep less than six hours a night accumulate sleep debt, which can lead to severe health consequences over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 UK Biobank study involving over 7,800 participants found that individuals in their 50s who slept less than five hours per night were 20% more likely to develop multiple chronic conditions, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dementia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, sleep deprivation is associated with weakened immune function, poor memory, mood instability, and a higher risk of accidents. So unless you’re genetically tested and confirmed to be a natural short sleeper, cutting back on sleep can be dangerous — not admirable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why sleep matters: The body’s restoration cycle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand why most people need 7–8 hours of sleep, it’s important to know what happens during that time. Sleep is not a passive state; it’s a dynamic biological process governed by our circadian rhythm, the body’s internal 24-hour clock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep consists of multiple stages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Light Sleep (N1 and N2) – Helps the body relax and transition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep Sleep (N3) – Critical for physical restoration, tissue repair, and immune function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;REM Sleep – Vital for learning, memory consolidation, and emotional processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a typical night, we cycle through these stages four to six times. For natural short sleepers, research suggests that their bodies compress these cycles, achieving full restoration in a shorter window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They may experience a more efficient distribution of deep sleep and REM stages, allowing them to complete the “tasks” of sleep at high speed — like a compressed file that contains all the data in less space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are you a natural short sleeper?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering if you might be part of this rare elite group? According to sleep researchers, natural short sleepers exhibit several consistent traits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep just 3–5 hours per night and wake up feeling fully rested&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Never feel the need to nap or “catch up” on weekends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show no signs of fatigue, brain fog, or irritability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain excellent health and cognitive function&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Often display high energy, optimism, and productivity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, self-diagnosis is not recommended. If you suspect you might be a natural short sleeper, consult a sleep specialist and undergo polysomnography or genetic testing to confirm. Many people mistakenly believe they’re short sleepers but are, in fact, sleep-deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future of sleep: Genetic engineering or natural evolution?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With genetic research accelerating, it’s not far-fetched to imagine a future where gene-editing technologies like CRISPR could give people FNSS-like traits. But such advancements are years — if not decades — away, and ethical considerations abound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, scientists are using the study of FNSS to understand how sleep works at the molecular level, which could have applications in fields ranging from neurodegenerative disease treatment to space travel, where managing sleep in constrained environments is vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, natural short sleepers challenge one of the most fundamental assumptions of modern medicine — that all humans have the same biological need for rest. And in doing so, they open the door to a future where sleep is not just a necessity, but a personalized experience based on genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 14:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgJBVV95cUxPWmlvMnFpbXRnS2o2bmNPMGsxYjBXN1RFaHA1QkZITmxOa3VOQ1NTWXE1YnJ1Snl6Y1RWT00wZktJQndXU2VybGNBRXdKaW5jaElhN05rZUJMWkNCbDlRWExzUl8zZjVMTFUwSjZMMktRQzY5TV8zaFc4TkhqY0ZfU2VGaVJuWlRFQWZRX2w2Wm1jMTFjZzA2eEpGM0VPNGpQZGFxa2ptXy1WOURHTGFwOWo3OXZ5alBHLUFUcnd3YnVuTFl4ZEp0ODhCd1FPbUlkZE02Rm1RTG1vM25MbF9yVTZ4OWp6SGNLWW8ydDFQRzN6ZlBXRGoxb2ZKZDJKSmdKSEVmbVRNdWdUdGx6aWRWQlljQV82dw</guid></item><item><title>卫星首次测量河流波浪--《华盛顿邮报》 | Satellite measures river flow waves for the first time - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPSGZBNEU3bU9Ib1JERzA3NmdIdktWdXFJQWktcFF4cVJIdzRPQTlyeFZaWjRMdTZBSUF5bE5VZDBLd3ktcVpCa1JfU3c0dDZ6Z0FSNWpBYXBncHQ4MzNiTHktMkdLcW51ejYtSzA1SEVuZUNuTWt1UGx3cnREd0FfaFl2VUNTOWo0a2g5RHJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5ANLMHNKTZFD7MC3L23IT7AUIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Long river waves, known as flow waves, have been measured by satellite for the first time, researchers announced May 14, a breakthrough that could expand understanding of river dynamics, floods and the other hazards sometimes present when the waves form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VQ7ZILS7CJGK5LF2L4GDFLWCDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL113875" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Geophysical Research Letters, the researchers found that the long waves can be spotted and studied using data from a NASA-French space agency satellite designed to study Earth’s water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UEKR5WO72BAJ7KYQTI2VRDOVUI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study used satellite data from the &lt;a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/science/overview/?page=0&amp;amp;per_page=40&amp;amp;order=position+asc&amp;amp;search=&amp;amp;hover=false&amp;amp;show_institution=true&amp;amp;show_email=false&amp;amp;category=214" target="_blank"&gt;Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)&lt;/a&gt; mission.

The hormone doesn’t just raise or lower self-esteem—it actually changes how much social evaluation influences a person’s moment-to-moment feelings of self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research sheds light on how testosterone shapes what psychologists call “state self-esteem”—a person’s temporary sense of self-worth that fluctuates in response to social cues. The results could help explain why men with lower self-esteem sometimes show increased vulnerability to mood disturbances or antisocial behavior. The study also opens the door to potential new treatment strategies that combine hormonal and behavioral approaches to boost mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-esteem isn’t static. While people often talk about self-esteem as a fixed trait, psychologists distinguish between trait self-esteem, which reflects someone’s overall self-worth, and state self-esteem, which can rise or fall in response to recent experiences. These fluctuations can have real consequences. People with low or unstable self-esteem are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and even aggressive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men’s self-esteem, in particular, may be more sensitive to changes in social status or perceived rejection. Previous research has suggested that testosterone, a sex hormone known to influence dominance behavior and sensitivity to status, might also affect self-esteem. But the evidence has been mixed. Some studies have shown that testosterone increases self-esteem in certain groups, such as men with low baseline levels, while others have found no clear link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was designed to provide more precise evidence by focusing on how testosterone changes the process of self-esteem updating. In other words, do men on testosterone respond differently when they receive approval or disapproval from others?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 120 healthy young men, aged 18 to 26, and randomly assigned them to receive either a dose of testosterone gel or a placebo. The study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, meaning neither the participants nor the researchers knew who received the real hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After applying the gel, participants waited three hours to allow testosterone levels to rise. They then completed a task designed to mimic real-world social evaluation. Before the experiment, each participant provided personal information used to create a profile. They were told that 184 strangers would view this profile and either approve or disapprove of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the task, participants predicted whether they would receive approval from each “rater” and then received feedback in the form of a thumbs-up, thumbs-down, or no response. After every few trials, they rated how good they felt about themselves at that moment. This rating served as a measure of state self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to the participants, the feedback they received was pre-programmed. Raters were grouped into categories with different approval probabilities: very likely (85% approval), somewhat likely (70%), somewhat unlikely (30%), or very unlikely (15%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that testosterone changed how participants formed expectations about social feedback. Men who received testosterone were more optimistic when anticipating approval from high-approval raters, but also more pessimistic with raters known to give negative feedback. In other words, testosterone sharpened the contrast between positive and negative social expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, testosterone also made men more sensitive to the feedback itself. When men in the testosterone group received positive feedback, their self-esteem increased more than it did in the placebo group. But when they received negative feedback, their self-esteem dropped more sharply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand these patterns, the researchers used computational modeling. They applied a model that treats self-esteem updating as a learning process—similar to how people adjust their beliefs based on feedback in other situations, like predicting rewards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model showed that participants on testosterone gave more weight to two key components: their expectation of social approval and the difference between what they expected and what they actually received, also known as a prediction error. This suggests that testosterone enhances the brain’s attention to social outcomes, making people more responsive to the highs and lows of social evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while testosterone increased sensitivity to both approval and disapproval, it did not affect the basic learning rate—that is, how quickly people adjusted their beliefs based on prediction errors. Instead, testosterone influenced the importance participants assigned to the feedback and their expectations when forming self-esteem judgments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings help explain why testosterone is often linked with behaviors related to social dominance or status. If testosterone heightens sensitivity to approval and rejection, it could amplify the motivation to seek positive social outcomes—or avoid negative ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also support the idea that self-esteem functions like a “sociometer,” tracking how accepted or rejected someone feels. Testosterone appears to modulate this system, increasing the emotional impact of social signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has clinical implications too. Low self-esteem is linked to a variety of mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal. In some cases, testosterone therapy has been used to treat mood symptoms in men with low testosterone. This study suggests that combining testosterone with positive social environments or feedback-based therapies might improve self-esteem more effectively than either approach alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study had some limitations. All participants were young men, so it’s unclear whether the findings would generalize to women or to older adults. Some studies have found that testosterone affects men and women differently, especially in social and emotional contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also did not measure participants’ natural testosterone levels before the experiment. Since baseline levels may influence how people respond to additional testosterone, future studies could examine whether individual differences in hormone levels change the effect of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is the artificial nature of the task. While the social feedback was designed to mimic real-world interactions, participants knew they were in a study and may have reacted differently than they would in daily life. Nonetheless, the task captured meaningful fluctuations in self-esteem and allowed for precise measurement of the psychological processes involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore how testosterone affects social learning in more natural settings or in people with mental health conditions linked to low self-esteem. It could also investigate whether similar effects occur with other hormones or in response to different kinds of feedback, such as praise from peers or criticism from authority figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.02.008" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Testosterone Administration Increases the Computational Impact of Social Evaluation on the Updating of State Self-Esteem&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jixin Long, Junsong Lu, Yang Hu, Philippe N.
