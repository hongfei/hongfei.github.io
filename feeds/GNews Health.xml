					&lt;p&gt;Ben-Gurion University of the Negev’s Prof. Alon Monsonego says he has discovered a set of immune cells that may hold the secret to prolonging longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The immune system deteriorates with time, and that process may dictate the pace of aging,” said Monsonego, 61, of Ben-Gurion’s Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics in the Faculty of Health Sciences. Monsonego, who is also affiliated with the school of Brain Sciences and Cognition, heads the university’s Neuroimmunology lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking with The Times of Israel via Zoom, Monsonego explained that as people age, senescent cells — cells that can no longer divide and cause inflammation — accumulate, leading to tissue damage and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p id="gpt-passback"&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;However, Monsonego’s team discovered that certain lymphocytes, or white blood cells, known as cytotoxic T helper cells, can identify and destroy infected or cancerous cells within the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team didn’t realize the unique qualities of these T helper cells until a Japanese study showed that the immune systems of super-centenarians — people who live to be over 100 years old — were full of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter newsletter-article" data-website="timesofisrael" data-from="Medical Holy Grail: Israeli researchers isolate elusive cells that may slow down aging"&gt;

	&lt;p class="newsletter-error newsletter-article-error"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
		
&lt;p&gt;“We found these cytotoxic T helper cells can be very effective in reducing the burden of senescent cells, allowing tissues to regenerate and recover,” the researcher said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were published this month in the respected peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00953-8"&gt;Nature Aging,&lt;/a&gt; in a paper led by Monsonego’s lab researcher Dr. Yehezqel Elyahu, in collaboration with Ben-Gurion’s Prof. Esti &lt;a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-team-uses-tool-that-finds-fake-online-profiles-to-detect-abnormal-protein-activity/"&gt;Yeger-Lotem&lt;/a&gt;, and Prof. Valery Krizhanovsky of the Weizmann Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope this research will lead to diagnostic tools and then therapy treatments to track and improve healthy aging,” Monsongego said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emphasizing ‘health span’ and not ‘life span’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“About five years ago, we started looking at the differences between the lymphocytes of young and old mice,” Monsonego said. “We know that with aging, you get more inflammation and a less capable immune system. We were curious to know why.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that these days, scientists talk less about life span — how long someone will live — and focus more on health span, which is how long a person remains healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientist pointed out that aging-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease often begin in the fourth decade of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you say ‘aging,’ people think of their seventies, but it actually starts much earlier,” he said. “If you want to preserve health span, you need to start early.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough to live to 90 with five different diseases,” Monsonego said. “We need to think about living healthy, not just living long.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The importance of cytotoxic T helper cells&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsonego’s earlier work, published five years ago, helped define what he called a “roadmap” for how lymphocytes change with age.&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;“No one ever did that before,” he said. “We were pioneers in identifying, in detail, the dynamic changes of cytotoxic T helper cells in aging mice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is when we realized the surprising and significant accumulation of these cells,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest experiment, the team generated genetically modified mice that did not have the cytotoxic T helper cells and compared them with mice that did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Without these cells, the mice lived shorter lives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the researchers first identified these cells, they thought there was some kind of mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It surprised me, because I used to think that if you have something that appears late in life, it probably means something goes wrong,” Monsonego said.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figure id="attachment_2888959" class="wp-caption  alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2022/12/F220911NS03.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-2888959" src="https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/www/uploads/2022/12/F220911NS03-640x400.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsonego said that he is now attempting to study the immune system of super-centenarians living in Blue Zones, areas around the world where the population has a life expectancy much higher than the global average, since “our study suggests that the immune system of healthy older individuals may have properties which we weren’t aware of before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these super-centenarians, it’s not only a matter of “extremely good genes,” Monsonego said. “For most of us, it depends on how we live. Increasing your lifespan means being aware that you need to work hard at it. You need to make sure that you have a good diet and exercise. People need to change their lifestyle early enough, before they develop a chronic disease. Medicine alone can’t do magic.”&lt;/p&gt;
               
           
           
        
&lt;p&gt;Asya Rolls, professor of neuroscience at Tel Aviv University’s School of Neurobiology, Biochemistry and Biophysics, who was unconnected to the study, told The Times of Israel that Monsonego’s research on the discovery of these T Helper cells suggests that “aging might be more controllable than we thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Strengthening this natural immune mechanism could eventually open new ways to slow down age-related decline and keep tissues healthier for longer,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monsonego said that his lab is continuing the research to see how these cells can slow down age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s the goal,” he said. “To develop a diagnostic tool that can identify the changes in the T helper cells, and then, of course, to follow it with therapeutic strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A combination of obesity and low levels of the nutrient &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choline"&gt;choline&lt;/a&gt; could contribute to accelerated brain aging and potentially some early triggers of neurodegenerative diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183784" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline is well established as one of the most vital nutrients for a healthy body, so a lack of it, together with stresses associated with obesity, might act as warning signs for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-speech-trait-that-foreshadows-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; long before actual symptoms appear, according to researchers led by a team from Arizona State University (ASU).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This research adds to the growing evidence that choline is a valuable marker of metabolic and brain dysfunction – and reinforces the importance of sufficient daily intake, as it is essential for human health," &lt;a href="https://news.asu.edu/20251125-health-and-medicine-surprising-connection-between-obesity-choline-and-brain-inflammation"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurobiologist Ramon Velazquez, from ASU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/speaking-multiple-languages-may-slow-brain-aging-study-suggests"&gt;Speaking Multiple Languages May Slow Brain Aging, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several new reports published this month further link reduced blood choline levels to behavioral changes, including anxiety and memory impairment, as well as broader metabolic dysfunction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 15 people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/to-tackle-our-obesity-crisis-experts-say-everything-we-do-must-change"&gt;with obesity&lt;/a&gt; with an average age of 33.6, matching them against 15 healthy controls, before analyzing key chemical levels and biomarkers in the systems of all participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183787" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183787" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ObesityWheel.jpg" alt="Obesity study findings" class="wp-image-183787 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ObesityWheel.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/ObesityWheel-600x604.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183787" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Obesity was linked to a variety of other biomarkers. (Ramon Velazquez Lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with obesity were found to have several noticeable differences, including less choline circulating through their bodies, an increased number of biomarkers linked to inflammation, and higher levels of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/neurological/depts/multiple-sclerosis/ms-approaches/neurofilament-light-chain"&gt;neurofilament light&lt;/a&gt; (NfL) – a blood protein indicating neuron damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a strong correlation between lower choline and higher NfL in those with obesity, and crucially, the same pattern was observed in analyses of post-mortem brain tissue from older people who had died with Alzheimer's or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/millions-of-americans-have-cognitive-impairment-and-dont-know-it"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data isn't comprehensive enough to prove cause and effect, but the big picture is that obesity, choline, and accelerated brain aging leading to dementia could all be connected. Choline could be part of the reason why obesity &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-obesity-protect-against-dementia-or-increase-risk"&gt;is a risk factor for Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results suggest that, in young adults, good metabolic health and adequate choline contribute to neuronal health, laying the groundwork for healthy aging," &lt;a href="https://news.asu.edu/20251125-health-and-medicine-surprising-connection-between-obesity-choline-and-brain-inflammation"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ASU behavioral neuroscientist Jessica Judd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the latest study to highlight the multitude of variables and factors involved in brain aging and dementia. Untangling the knotty combination of causes and consequences is a real challenge for scientists, and discoveries like this can bring clarity to what's happening &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/aging-scrambles-brain-proteins-and-diet-could-partly-reverse-it"&gt;as brains get older&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies are required to understand the details of this three-way link between obesity, choline, and neurodegeneration, but the researchers suggest that low levels of the nutrient could be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-early-speech-related-signs-youre-at-risk-of-alzheimers-disease"&gt;an early warning sign&lt;/a&gt; of diseases such as Alzheimer's, suggesting a boost to choline levels might work as a preventative measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the liver produces a small amount of choline naturally, our daily recommended intake can be easily managed by eating eggs, fish, poultry, beans, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/broccolis-anti-cancer-compound-could-have-a-whole-other-health-benefit"&gt;cruciferous vegetables&lt;/a&gt;.

The health department said it became aware of the infection "over the weekend," and began looking into where the resident may have visited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resident visited three different locations, the department said, and warned that anyone at the following locations at the indicated times may have been exposed to the virus:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kid Zone, 340 W. Antelope Drive, in Clearfield on Nov. 26, from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Treehouse Children's Museum, 347 22nd Street, in Ogden on Nov. 26 from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Walmart Supercenter, 745 W. Hill Field Road, in Layton on Nov 26 from 6:20 p.m. to 7:20 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area, and anyone at these locations during the aforementioned times may have been exposed, even without direct contact with the resident, the health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Willardson, the department's communicable disease and epidemiology division director, said the illness can be prevented with the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Being fully vaccinated against measles does more than just protect the person who receives the vaccination; it also protects their family and friends, including children who may be too young to be vaccinated, and it helps limit the spread of disease in the community, " she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department urges anyone who believes they may have measles or has been exposed to someone with measles to stay home and call their health care provider before seeking care so the provider can prevent exposure to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection marks the first case of measles in Davis County, though the state of Utah has reported 102 confirmed cases of measles as of Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The small molecule &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermine"&gt;spermine&lt;/a&gt; has the potential to stop the toxic build-up of proteins in the brain that characterizes diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="183646" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="183646" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;, researchers have found – and it works a bit like melting cheese on spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've known about spermine for more than 150 years: its regular job has to do with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-a-few-minutes-of-daily-activity-can-boost-your-metabolism-study-reveals"&gt;the body's metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, the business of converting food into energy, and keeping all of the key biological functions running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers led by a team from the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) in Switzerland found that extra spermine given to worms with Alzheimer's and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;Parkinson's-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; showed improved health in old age, with cells less likely to lose power and wear out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switch-turns-brains-defenses-into-protectors-against-alzheimers"&gt;Switch Turns Brain's Defenses Into Protectors Against Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A close analysis of cells in test tubes showed what was happening: the spermine encourages tau and alpha-synuclein proteins, typically misbehaving in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, to condense together into liquid-like droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, in turn, makes these toxic proteins easier for the body's waste recycling system, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autophagy"&gt;known as autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, to clear out, maintaining normal cell function. There's even a cooking analogy that describes what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The spermine is like cheese that connects the long, thin pasta without gluing them together, making them easier to digest," &lt;a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/news/media-releases/spermine-against-alzheimer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biophysicist Jinghui Luo, from PSI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183649" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/WormScans.jpg" alt="Worm spermine scans" class="wp-image-183649 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/WormScans.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/WormScans-600x412.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183649" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;When spermine was given to worms (bottom row), it reduced the level of protein clumping (brighter spots). (Sun et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tau and alpha-synuclein are what's known as amyloid proteins, and when these proteins malfunction, they can form hard, sticky aggregates that go on to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-study-reveals-how-toxic-clumps-warp-neurons-at-their-core"&gt;damage brain cells&lt;/a&gt; in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not fully clear if these clumps are a cause or consequence of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, but they're definitely involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spermine creates clumps of a kind, too, but they're softer and more mobile. This makes them easier to wipe away through the body's clean-up system, while also preventing the proteins from making solid plaques – which then become like crusted food stuck to the bottom of a pan, and much harder to remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Autophagy is more effective at handling larger protein clumps," &lt;a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/news/media-releases/spermine-against-alzheimer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Luo. "And spermine is, so to speak, the binding agent that brings the strands together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are only weakly attractive electrical forces between the molecules, and these organize them but do not firmly bind them together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the researchers showed that spermine only interferes with tau and alpha-synuclein when they're at too high a concentration, and are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-first-synthetic-mini-prion-could-help-study-diseases-like-alzheimers"&gt;more likely to misfold&lt;/a&gt; under stress, leading to toxic clumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it's a long way from test tube and worm experiments to seeing all of this working in a human brain with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, but these early signs are good ones. Extra spermine might help the brain clear problematic proteins more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spermine was chosen for the study because it has &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/15384101.2014.973309"&gt;previously been shown&lt;/a&gt; to protect against damaging processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/speaking-multiple-languages-may-slow-brain-aging-study-suggests"&gt;Speaking Multiple Languages May Slow Brain Aging, Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After these results, the researchers are hopeful that spermine and molecules like it could be used to tackle multiple diseases, including  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="183646" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; – almost like special sauces mixed together to remove toxic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we better understand the underlying processes, we can cook tastier and more digestible dishes, so to speak, because then we'll know exactly which spices, in which amounts, make the sauce especially tasty," &lt;a href="https://www.psi.ch/en/news/media-releases/spermine-against-alzheimer"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Luo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-65426-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/thrush-22389"&gt;Thrush&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most common infections in the world. It's caused by the fungi &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;– specifically, the yeast &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a019778"&gt;yeast infections&lt;/a&gt; are normally treated easily with antifungal drugs, a growing number of &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;species are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8020154"&gt;developing resistance&lt;/a&gt; to these drugs – including the species that causes thrush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/candidiasis/antimicrobial-resistance/index.html"&gt;about 7%&lt;/a&gt; of all &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;blood samples tested are resistant to the &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/fluconazole.html"&gt;antifungal drug fluconazole&lt;/a&gt;, the first-line drug used to treat most &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-fungi-live-inside-you-and-they-may-affect-your-health"&gt;These Fungi Live Inside You, And They May Affect Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means there are &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/25-10-2022-who-releases-first-ever-list-of-health-threatening-fungi"&gt;fewer treatment options&lt;/a&gt; for even routine thrush infections – making them more difficult to treat. It also means that &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/cmr.00029-06"&gt;more severe &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; infections&lt;/a&gt;, which can occur in people who have a weakened immune system or are taking long courses of antibiotics, will become even harder to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics16121555"&gt;Antifungal resistance&lt;/a&gt; may also be contributing to the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30103-8"&gt;rise in recurrent thrush&lt;/a&gt; (thrush infections that continue to come back). This affects around 138 million women worldwide, but is expected to rise to 158 million people by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why resistance is growing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antifungal resistance landscape has changed dramatically over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early to mid-2000s, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00029-06"&gt;antifungal resistance was rare&lt;/a&gt;. Fluconazole worked well for most&lt;em&gt; Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; infections, less than 5% of which being resistant to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; is a highly adaptable microorganism, which can easily develop resistance to antifungals under the right conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that resistance among &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jof11030232"&gt;trending upwards&lt;/a&gt; over the past eight years at least. A small study of patients in Egypt found that in 2024, nearly 26% of &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt; isolates from blood samples were resistant to fluconazole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, more research is needed to understand whether this picture is the same worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jacamr/dlaf106"&gt;develop resistance&lt;/a&gt; to antifungal drugs through genetic mutations, which make them less susceptible to antifungals or help them reduce the drug's effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;can also protect itself from antifungal drugs by forming &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb.13.101"&gt;tough biofilms&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2217/fmb.13.101"&gt;slimy layers&lt;/a&gt; of fungal cells block drugs from getting in, help the fungus pump any drugs that have penetrated the barrier back out, and allow some cells to hide in a resting state until treatment is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183799" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183799" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/candida_colonies_642.jpg" alt="candida colonies on an agar plate" class="wp-image-183799 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/candida_colonies_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/candida_colonies_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183799" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; can grow a tough, protective biofilm.

There are several factors that are contributing to the problem, including the misuse and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1354757"&gt;overuse of antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt; (not just by people but in agriculture too) and the &lt;a href="https://en.fungaleducation.org/blog/2025/04/28/who-publishes-report-on-fungal-diagnostics-and-antifungal-treatments/"&gt;limited number&lt;/a&gt; of effective antifungal drugs that are available (which are difficult and expensive to develop).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasing environmental temperatures, ecological stress, and fungicide use are also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01397-19"&gt;creating conditions&lt;/a&gt; that favour heat-tolerant and drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;strains – such as &lt;em&gt;Candida auris&lt;/em&gt;, which is highly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S249864"&gt;resistant to multiple classes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/apm.13336"&gt;antifungal drugs&lt;/a&gt;, and can cause severe infection in people who have a weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing antifungal resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1258837"&gt;primarily transmitted&lt;/a&gt; through person-to-person contact, sexual contact, and contact with contaminated objects or surfaces. In healthcare settings, &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;can also spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1258837"&gt;contaminated medical equipment&lt;/a&gt; and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airborne transmission is not common with &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt;. However, an alarming &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00795"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; reported that species of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; resistant to common antifungal drugs were detected in urban air samples in Hong Kong. This included &lt;em&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;in air could increase the likelihood of community spread and elevate the risk of inhalation – particularly in hospitals, crowded areas, or care homes with immunocompromised people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a potential route of exposure that has previously been underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183801" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183801" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/care_home_642.jpg" alt="care home" class="wp-image-183801 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/care_home_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/care_home_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183801" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Presence of &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; in crowded care homes and hospitals can increase its spread.

Maintaining a healthy microbiome is key to protecting yourself: the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2021.1979877"&gt;beneficial bacteria&lt;/a&gt; in your body help keep &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;levels under control and prevent it from overgrowing and becoming problematic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the balance of your friendly bacteria is disrupted – for example, by antibiotics, poor diet, a weakened immune system, or high stress – &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13099-025-00755-8"&gt;grow out of control&lt;/a&gt;, leading to illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microbiome disruption can also create conditions where antifungal-resistant &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;can overgrow, form resistant biofilms, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00610-24"&gt;become harder to treat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/powerful-new-antibiotic-was-hiding-in-plain-sight-for-decades"&gt;Powerful New Antibiotic Was 'Hiding in Plain Sight' For Decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10020183"&gt;Looking after your microbiome&lt;/a&gt; can make a significant difference in reducing the risk of Candida and other infections. This involves eating a diverse, fibre-rich diet – including fermented foods – and limiting highly processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only take antibiotics when prescribed. Probiotics and prebiotics may also help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1187831"&gt;maintain your microbiome balance&lt;/a&gt;, especially after antibiotic use or recurrent infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most &lt;em&gt;Candida &lt;/em&gt;infections are treatable, drug-resistant strains and infections in vulnerable people can be serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we can all do our part to prevent resistant strains from developing – including by only taking antifungal medicines exactly as prescribed, completing the full course, and maintaining good hygiene.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267915/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

He was 46. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just weeks earlier, he had undergone genetic testing that came back positive for Lynch syndrome - a condition caused by hereditary genetic mutations which increases the risk of colon cancer even in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15208783/Colon-cancer-rising-young-people-study-global.html"&gt;young, otherwise healthy, adults&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As such, Tiffany's widowed aunt urged her and the rest of her family to also get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the time, it wasn't even a thing I knew to be scared of,' Tiffany, now 43, told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But testing confirmed the worst: Tiffany - and her brother too - had Lynch syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Ohio native - who had just turned 30 and was pregnant with her youngest of two sons at the time - was now up to 80 percent more likely than her peers to develop colorectal, endometrial, breast, stomach, esophageal, pancreatic and skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tiffany Graham Charkosky (pictured here as a child with her mother) was just 11 years old when her mother died of colon cancer. Two decades later, Tiffany learned she has Lynch syndrome, which dramatically raises her risk of several forms of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was pretty shocking. I was right around the age that my mom had gotten sick,' she told the Daily Mail. 'That definitely sent me into a tailspin of worrying about my own health, then the health of my family.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 300 Americans (roughly one million people) are born with Lynch syndrome. However, upward of nine in 10 don't know they have it since genetic testing is the only detection method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For that testing to happen, patients generally have to wait until they or a family member are diagnosed with one of the forms of cancer it is linked to, leaving hundreds of thousands unaware of their risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lynch syndrome is caused by a mutation in the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 genes, which are responsible for repairing mistakes in DNA. Mutations in these raise the risk of cells multiplying uncontrollably and becoming cancerous.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lynch syndrome most often raises the likelihood of developing colorectal cancer, which has skyrocketed in young Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the past two decades, the rate of colorectal cancer in people under 50 has risen from 8.6 cases per 100,000 people in 1999 to 13 cases per 100,000 people in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer diagnoses in 20 to 34-year-olds are estimated to increase by 90 percent between 2010 and 2030, and rates for teenagers have already surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average American has a five percent risk of developing colorectal cancer, but for a patient with Lynch syndrome, that likelihood jumps to anywhere from 40 to 80 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women, according to MD Anderson Cancer Center, are also at a 40 to 60 percent greater risk of developing ovarian and breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before being diagnosed with the syndrome, Tiffany and her siblings were undergoing colonoscopies every five years to check for colorectal cancer due to their mother's early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, unless a patient has a relevant family history, colonoscopies are only recommended every 10 years and not until age 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tiffany is pictured here as a child with her uncle, who died of colon cancer at age 46. His death prompted the family to be tested for Lynch syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tiffany (pictured) now gets regular screenings for colon, breast, skin and esophageal cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since being diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, Tiffany now gets colonoscopies every year, along with endoscopies to check for esophageal cancer every one to three years, along with annual mammograms for breast cancer and exams to check for skin cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had a hysterectomy six months after her diagnosis to prevent uterine and cervical cancer. Just after her 40th birthday, doctors removed her ovaries to prevent ovarian cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer is also often caused by diets high in red and processed meats, fat and sodium, so Tiffany tried to focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Graham Charkosky's book, Living Proof, was released last month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just try to live a life of moderation,' she told the Daily Mail. '[I try] to sleep as well as I can and try to make exercise a priority. It's more about trying to live a balanced life than it is about trying to restrict my diet. That has been what makes me feel best in the long run so far.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is currently unclear if Tiffany's two sons, who are 13 and 16, also have Lynch syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors recommend waiting until they become adults to test them so they can better cope with the 'emotional weight' of the disorder, if they have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The recommendation is to let your children get older so that they can make informed medical decisions and process that information in an age-appropriate way,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early years after her diagnosis, Tiffany searched for literature on Lynch syndrome but with little luck. So in 2015, three years after her diagnosis, she wrote the book herself, titled 'Living Proof: How Love Defied Genetic Legacy'. It came out in October this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was like three years past the initial shock and "newborn phase", and all of that really struck me - that I wasn't done thinking about this and felt like I was maybe in a position of trying to organize my thoughts and share what that journey looked like,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tiffany says she hopes that, by reading her book, other people with Lynch syndrome are able to 'take some agency' back when the cancer risk feels uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I want them to know that they didn't do anything wrong, that they're still who they've always been and that in facing their risks head on, as scary as it is, they're setting themselves up for a better future,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Living Proof: How Love Defied Genetic Legac&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;y on Amazon, Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and others through Little A publishing.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The State Department issued a terse statement last week saying, "an awareness day is not a strategy." The result is that on December 1, the United States is not commemorating World AIDS Day. It's the first time the U.S. has not participated since the World Health Organization created this day in 1988 to remember the &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/UNAIDS_FactSheet_en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;millions of people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who have died of AIDS-related illnesses and recommit to fighting the epidemic that still claims the lives of more than half a million people each year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By contrast, last year former President Joe Biden held a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House with the &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmemorial.org/quilt-history" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AIDS Memorial Quilt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — with coffin-shaped patches each honoring someone who had died of AIDS-related causes — spread out on the grass. And this year, despite the Trump administration's change of heart, countries around the world are marking the day with proclamations, public health campaigns and commemorative ceremonies.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then and now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;President Trump has nothing planned for this year and the State Department has instructed employees not to mark the day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, confirmed the decision not to commemorate the day, writing in a statement that the country is "modernizing our approach to countering infectious diseases" and that "under the leadership of President Trump, the State Department is working directly with foreign governments to save lives and increase their responsibility and burden sharing."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some HIV/AIDS activists reacted with frustration to the news — and with protests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's emblematic of an administration that doesn't seem to care," said &lt;a href="https://avac.org/mitchell-warren/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mitchell Warren&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of AVAC, a global HIV prevention organization based in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has consistently been the top financial supporter of the global fight against HIV/AIDS, primarily through President George W. Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which has invested more than &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$110 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into the global effort since it launched in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, since the start of President Trump's second term, almost a year ago, his administration has made major cuts to global health spending and programing as it champions an America First approach and emphasizes countries being weaned off aid. This has disrupted HIV/AID care in many parts of the world — including making it challenging for some HIV-positive individuals to get their medication in places such as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/04/14/g-s1-59863/hiv-aids-drugs-usaid-zambia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zambia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and Kenya, according to UNAIDS.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Is this a symbolic act? Yes, it is and it symbolizes something that is actually devastating and chaotic," says Warren.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. is not alone in reducing international aid, as other countries – including France, Germany and the United Kingdom — have scaled back on foreign assistance as they shift priorities. The &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/november/wad-2025-report" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UNAIDS report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for World AIDS Day this year warned of "ruinous consequences."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Protesters gathered outside the White House on Monday, demanding that funding be restored. Asia Russell – executive director of Health GAP, a global HIV advocacy organization – was one of them. She says the decision not to mark the day was reminiscent of the early days of the HIV/AIDS fight when the disease was highly stigmatized and overlooked as a public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In recent years, medical advances have meant there's been progress in the combatting new HIV/AIDS injection and getting those who are already infected on treatment. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So what's missing is political will, and that lack of political will was on devastating display when the White House announced that it would ban commemoration of this pandemic. It's truly depraved and outrageous," Russell says, adding that there were about 100 other people at the protest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The decision not to mark World AIDS Day is in line with the administration's broader approach to WHO and the United Nations more broadly. Trump has been critical of multilateral organizations like the U.N. and of WHO's handling of COVID. One of his first moves, on inauguration day, was to start the process of &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;removing the U.S. from the WHO&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Trump Administration has marked other days designated by the UN, such as World Autism Awareness Day. The White House issued a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/world-autism-awareness-day-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;proclamation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for that day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;World AIDS Day "only exists on the calendar because of pressure from people with HIV and their communities fighting back against stigma," Russell says. "A commemorative day, as minor as that might sound, is actually life-saving work to chip away at that deadly stigma."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Health care providers in Portland and elsewhere in Maine have been preparing for a potential spike in cases, with some telling the Bangor Daily News last month that they expected the outbreak to spread beyond the Bangor area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely not the news we want to hear, and it’s also something we’ve been bracing for for a while,” Katie Rutherford, executive director of the Portland-based Frannie Peabody Center, said Monday. Her organization is a nonprofit focused on HIV/AIDS services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maine CDC directive noted that the agency is working with community organizations and medical providers to increase access to HIV and hepatitis C testing in Cumberland County, link people to care, and offer prevention services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alert also encouraged providers statewide to “ensure these services are available in communities throughout Maine” and recommended testing every three months for people at higher risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rutherford said she is in close contact with the Maine CDC and other organizations in the area that are working on “spreading our capacity as much as possible so that we can reach as many people as we can” with resources like HIV testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These groups will aim to reach populations that are at the highest risk of infection while also “just generally getting the message out to the community that HIV testing is really important and should be part of routine care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The directive from Maine CDC did not use the word “cluster” to describe the new set of cases in Cumberland County, the most populated county in the state, although public health officials referred to the earliest cases in Penobscot County as a cluster when case numbers were at similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Cumberland County, Penobscot County previously saw an average of one HIV case per year in people who inject drugs before the outbreak began, according to the Maine CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. CDC does not define HIV clusters or outbreaks based on any specific number of cases, but more generally as “groups of people that are experiencing rapid HIV transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsay Hammes, a spokesperson for the Maine CDC, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BDN previously reported that organizations outside of Penobscot County have been ramping up HIV testing efforts, including expanding access to self-test kits, in response to the ongoing outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frannie Peabody Center provides free HIV test kits via mail and sends them out in discreet packaging, Rutherford said. They are available to order on the organization’s website. Rutherford also noted that HIV tests are not always included in routine care at medical offices, so people who want to be tested with their provider may have to ask specifically for an HIV test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maine-based public health organizations have raised concerns about proposed cuts to HIV services at the federal level and how those could limit the state’s efforts to contain the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The House appropriations bill for next year proposed cutting $1.7 billion in funding for HIV programs, including completely eliminating HIV prevention programs and reducing care and treatment funding by 20 percent, according to the HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just an important reminder that the AIDS epidemic is not over,” Rutherford said, noting that Monday is World AIDS Day. This is the first year the federal government has not recognized the day since it was first designated in 1988.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WGME</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:54:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxORkZZbW1IRGU4V0E2U2RxbndrV21zbllsSncyMVhHTU5qbldELUh0Rlptc0tOSjE2Ql9vWkNLSzJtbzhObmhfOW9ibDdnZjI5ZEJpaUxlbHNOYWtFdURPOTRsb2wxSjlBNmtiXzM3Z1lRbjZCMnpoUkdQMWtWc3ZrTEhyeExlU1p2ZzVGWmZUTzg3Wm5FQjFadHdfemQ1OENk</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家揭示如果您患有高血压，最好戒掉的饮食习惯-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cardiologists-reveal-top-food-habit-to-stop-if-you-have-hypertension/articleshow/125704193.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects more than a billion people worldwide and remains one of the leading risks for heart attack and stroke. The American Heart Association (AHA) stresses that lifestyle choices play a crucial role in managing it, and cardiologists say the first step is identifying one common eating habit that quietly worsens blood pressure for millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The top habit to stop in hypertension&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important dietary change for people with hypertension is lowering sodium intake, especially by avoiding the excess sodium found in processed, packaged and restaurant foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Understanding hypertension as a major risk factor for the heart&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 70–75 percent of the sodium Americans consume comes from hidden sources, not from the salt shaker. The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK highlights the same trend, noting that most salt is added during food manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess sodium increases blood pressure by causing the body to retain water, which raises blood volume and increases pressure on artery walls. This mechanism is widely documented in cardiovascular research, including studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine and Hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)02181-6/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Exercise regularly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AHA advises 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity improves vascular elasticity and lowers blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Manage stress and prioritise sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific studies show that chronic stress and irregular sleep patterns elevate blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness, breathing exercises and consistent sleep routines can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Limit alcohol and avoid smoking&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both habits stiffen arteries and increase hypertension risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Monitor blood pressure consistently&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends home monitoring and following prescribed medication schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension is serious but highly manageable. Cardiologists and public health agencies agree that reducing excess dietary sodium, especially from processed and restaurant foods, is the most impactful dietary change for controlling blood pressure. Combined with exercise, better sleep, and regular check-ups, a lower-salt diet can significantly reduce long-term cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

Rehabbers cannot legally accept animals for treatment not covered by their state and federal licensing, but we will always try and point you in the right direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be honest and truthful when asked for information. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rabies in humans has a &amp;gt;99% fatality rate without treatment, and post-exposure vaccinations must be started within 48-72 hours of exposure. Fewer than 35 people in the last 50 years have survived rabies once symptoms appeared. These individuals were treated with a variety of highly experimental protocols, and there is not yet a validated, accepted treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a minute and assess the situation before attempting to capture wildlife without direction. You can reach out to licensed rehabilitators through Animal Help Now and also receive guidance from your state wildlife resource division. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;b&gt;[SIGN UP: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters" target="_self" rel="" title="https://membercenter.whio.com/newsletters"&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 lofITx body-paragraph body-copyright"&gt;©2025 Cox Media Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WHIO TV</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:29:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>古巴说，随着流行病的蔓延， 33人死于蚊子传播的疾病--路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cuba-says-33-have-died-mosquito-borne-illnesses-epidemic-rages-2025-12-01/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 21:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxOM1k3TEttck0xX3lUMUFHeGtWLUtBMW1ackpyR2VicjZic0FrR0puN0hvRHVONllXV0E3T3g3NjQ1S3pFNEV0SGdzRzJVRmF1bGVHcXZIY1VyLTNoU0hkZjVhOXBtRXZzSHp6eDhxZUxGNDRLUngwMGluZW94T2tYRXhWTkhQQkJpeGR0Z245ZFJLNU9fMXBiY2VHOFpqT09Mc0RaRGltUXI3Z3YzRTFPMGU2T3RlS3I3Z0pudV9fV2d6ZFo0alJlUjJJNkFIZTg</guid></item><item><title>新任ACIP主席将新冠肺炎疫情要求与大屠杀进行比较，称枪击导致癌症、流产- Endpoints News</title><link>https://endpoints.news/new-acip-chair-claims-covid-19-vaccines-caused-cancer-miscarriages/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="epn_content"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-072941/205716/Smartphone-Ownership-Age-of-Smartphone-Acquisition?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the &lt;a href="https://abcdstudy.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study&lt;/a&gt; (ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as "the largest long-term study of brain development and child health" in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone," Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. "We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results," Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' "The Daily Report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/childrens-hospital-of-philadelphia-study-links-smartphone-ownership-in-childhood-to-increased-risk-of-depression-and-obesity-in-youth-302627044.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having "a significant factor in teen health" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones "can play a constructive role" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/surgeon-general-social-media-teen-health-vivek-murthy/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"tech-free zones"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and encouraging kids to "foster in-person friendships." Meanwhile, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-york-school-cellphone-ban-hochul-budget/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;several states&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have taken steps to &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cellphone-bans-in-schools/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ban cellphones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-tech-acknowledgments/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone," said Barzilay. "Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep."&lt;/p&gt;

The drug, called CPACC, changes how magnesium moves inside cells. In mice, it stopped both weight gain and liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work, led by Dr. Madesh Muniswamy at The University of Texas Health Center at San Antonio (&lt;a href="https://uthscsa.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UTHCSA&lt;/a&gt;), used mice fed a Western-style diet for most of their lives, similar in calories to fast-food meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the world, obesity is climbing. It brings a higher risk of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-disease-kills-differently-now-than-five-decades-ago/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, and type 2 diabetes – a pattern doctors often group as cardiometabolic disease, a mix of heart and metabolic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, a large national survey found that about 40 percent of adults had obesity between 2021 and 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra body fat strains the heart and can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease – fat buildup in the liver not caused by drinking alcoho&lt;strong&gt;l.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside almost every cell sit mitochondria, tiny structures in cells that make most of our usable energy. When these power stations fail, the body struggles to burn sugar and fat, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/unexpected-weight-gain-linked-to-a-common-cooking-oil/"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; and high blood sugar become more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-magnesium-s-role-in-energy"&gt;Magnesium’s role in energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mineral &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/seeds-rich-in-protein-and-magnesium-help-grow-muscle-mass-fenugreek/"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, a charged mineral that helps many enzymes work, is essential for life. It supports muscle function and takes part in hundreds of reactions that turn food into cellular fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move magnesium in and out, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/damaged-mitochondria-recycled/"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; use a special ion channel, a protein tunnel that lets charged atoms cross a membrane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main channel that pulls magnesium into mitochondria is called MRS2. It sets how much of this ion enters the organelle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When too much &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/magnesium-threonate-is-best-supplement-for-improving-brain-health-says-neurologist/"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; collects inside mitochondria, their energy output can slow down instead of speeding up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this slowdown can feed into metabolic syndrome. That’s a cluster of high blood sugar, unhealthy cholesterol, and raised blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some body fat is especially active. So-called brown fat, a type of fat that burns energy to make heat, can help protect against weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-cpacc-controls-weight"&gt;How CPACC controls weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new mouse study, researchers blocked MRS2 so that less magnesium entered the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-loss-is-reversed-by-activating-mitochondria-in-the-brain/"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;. Mice that lacked this protein or had it blocked burned sugar and fat more efficiently, even though they ate the same rich food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then designed CPACC, a lab-made, cobalt-based molecule that blocks MRS2. Animals given CPACC showed reduced weight and white adipose tissue – the usual body fat under the skin – that resembled heat-producing fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that giving the drug to mice for a short period led to quick weight loss and a slimmer appearance. Such a treatment could cut cardiometabolic risks and lower liver cancer odds, creating a major health impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cpacc-is-not-a-junk-food-pass"&gt;CPACC is not a junk-food pass&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these experiments are preclinical – early lab and animal research done before human testing – and they were carried out only in mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice share many metabolic features with humans. But drugs that work well in mice often fail when researchers test them in people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPACC contains cobalt, and certain inorganic cobalt salts can be toxic at high &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK587403/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exposures&lt;/a&gt;. Any future human version will need very careful safety checks to make sure it does not harm the heart, nerves, or other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people, no pill can replace healthy food and regular movement. Even if a magnesium-targeting drug eventually reaches clinical trial, it would likely treat severe obesity or liver disease, not excuse junk food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouse results are still important because they reveal a new way to regulate metabolism. By tuning how magnesium flows into mitochondria, scientists may be able to shift the body from storing energy toward burning it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cpacc-and-weight-control"&gt;CPACC and weight control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will test different doses and schedules of CPACC and related molecules and explore how they affect weight, heart, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/astronauts-kidneys-may-not-survive-a-roundtrip-to-mars/"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt;, and brain health in animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also want to see whether similar strategies can protect against insulin resistance, the state when the body stops responding well to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In time, magnesium handling inside mitochondria could become a target for personalized medicine, tailoring treatments to a person’s unique biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some people might have variants in the MRS2 gene or related pathways that make them respond better to this kind of drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same pathway could also matter for people at high risk of heart attack, stroke, and liver cancer because of long-standing &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/obesity-is-much-more-complicated-than-we-thought-manifesting-in-11-different-forms/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If safe blockers of mitochondrial magnesium uptake can be designed, they may one day sit alongside diet and exercise to reduce obesity-related disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124723001663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 19:23:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNcldwUzdrMFlrSGFSV1paTF9rRTdlV05qbDU2WDBpY2t4bjJZZmsySWpOcVJ1Rmc1XzBpcHpwRHhRMEFNWXp2TGEwSmlYakVhdzBOU3hvOUszM2txaWpJS1NxVGtsRWpjOFh4UXZhMDM0MWxjQzNpa3YwUFg0aTNHTmVSdXdSV2xsdm5PTUJmeEhfNHN1TWpZSW1XaFlkWVU</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现运动对大脑健康最重要的确切年龄-男性健康</title><link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69545958/exercise-age-dementia-risk-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt7"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="body-dropcap css-1xzgd0b emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.0"&gt;EVERYONE KNOWS EXE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.1"&gt;RCISE &lt;/strong&gt;is good for you.

People who did higher levels of moderate or heavy activity in midlife—defined as ages 45 to 64—had a 40 percent lower risk of developing dementia compared to their counterparts who weren’t physically active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The researchers also saw a huge reason for people in midlife to continue exercising into their golden years.

But in this current study, researchers determined the real benefits to cognition were in people who kept exercising in midlife and beyond. People in early adulthood (26-44 years old) showed no link between being physically active in early adulthood and a reduction in Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-does-exercise-matter-more-later-in-life" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;Why Does Exercise Matter More Later in Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Doctors say there are a couple of reasons behind this. “Exercise in midlife drives improved cardiovascular health through late life,” explains &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amit Sachdev, MD, MS" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD, MS&lt;/a&gt;, medical director in the department of neurology at Michigan State University. Your brain health and heart health are connected, he points out. So, if your &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a68016190/the-new-science-of-building-a-high-performance-healthy-heart/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a68016190/the-new-science-of-building-a-high-performance-healthy-heart/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart" data-node-id="13.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; is in good shape, your brain likely is, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Working out also improves blood flow to the brain. And that's important, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil, DO" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center, in reducing the risk of vascular dementia. People with this type of dementia have trouble with memory and concentration because of a blockage or reduction of blood flow to the brain. In general, regular movement improves brain structure and function, reduces inflammation, and enhances blood vessel function, Hwang adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Physical activity may directly affect other elements that lead to Alzheimer's disease as well, such as the buildup of beta-amyloid, adds Hwang. Still, there's more work to be done to see whether this is the main way exercise protects against Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-you-delay-exercise-until-your-forties" data-node-id="16" class="body-h2 css-1ju5ws3 emevuu60"&gt;Can You Delay Exercise Until Your Forties? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The findings don’t mean that you should slack on fitness when you’re younger, Segil emphasizes. “The benefits of exercising earlier in life are what will allow you to get old,” he says. “A sedentary life as a young adult causes more health issues than memory loss as we age. Starting healthy habits early will allow you to live long enough to worry about getting memory loss when you are old.” As a bonus, those good habits will help your body from future &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69528457/vitamin-d-supplement-heart-attack-november-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69528457/vitamin-d-supplement-heart-attack-november-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="heart attacks" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; and stroke as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;So if you’re consistently active, keep carrying on—you can feel good knowing you’re doing your brain a solid by exercising throughout life. But if you’ve slacked on working out lately, these findings may provide that extra motivation you need to &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a63069031/how-to-get-back-into-working-out/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a63069031/how-to-get-back-into-working-out/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="get back to the gym" data-node-id="18.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;get back to the gym&lt;/a&gt;.

Every year, people around the world remember the early epidemic as a medical and moral tragedy, a time of too many funerals and too few medical breakthroughs. But the economic story — about how government abandonment led to the marketization of survival — is largely untold. That missing story matters, especially because its logic is resurfacing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early years of the AIDS crisis, when thousands of people were losing their jobs, housing, and health insurance, the American government didn’t intervene to stop the bleeding. Instead, a new, little-understood financial instrument emerged: people with AIDS began selling their life-insurance policies to investors for quick cash, often just to afford rent, medication, or a measure of comfort in their final months. An investor would pay a patient a portion of their life-insurance “death benefit” — maybe 80 percent of the policy’s value, maybe 30 percent, depending on how soon the patient was expected to die. After the patient’s death, the investor would collect the full insurance payout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These transactions, called viatical settlements, were often portrayed as a macabre curiosity of the epidemic — a clash between “bankrupt” sellers and “morally bankrupt” buyers. Gawking anchors on corporate news shows found a new favorite word: &lt;em&gt;ghoulish&lt;/em&gt;. But the viatical market wasn’t an aberration. It was a predictable outcome of austerity and abandonment, a textbook example of what happens when the social safety net is deliberately dismantled and private capital rushes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently directed a documentary about this industry, &lt;em&gt;Cashing Out&lt;/em&gt;, which also explores my own unexpected connection to it: my father was one of the early investors who bought life-insurance policies from people with AIDS. He profited when they died; unbeknownst to me, those profits helped fund my adolescent years — when, incidentally, I was figuring out I was gay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to fixate on the personal drama of this story, but that reaction obscures what viaticals actually reveal: investors weren’t the source of the cruelty; the state was. It created conditions in which people with AIDS had to make bets on their own deaths in order to survive, and in which ordinary people could be easily recruited into profiting from that precarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made viaticals possible was the deliberate erosion of public infrastructure under Ronald Reagan and, later, Bill Clinton — the hollowing out of Medicaid eligibility, disability benefits, and public housing — paired with the privatization of health care and the cultural decision to relegate queer people and drug users to destitution and death. The epidemic created new needs at precisely the moment the state was retreating from them. Markets could only fill the void because the state had left it wide open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was interviewing survivors for my film, I met Dee Dee Chamblee, a black trans activist in Atlanta who, while getting by as a sex worker, didn’t have a life-insurance policy to sell. She told me she viewed viaticals as the logical endpoint of a system that abandons people and then shames them for surviving however they can. What struck Dee Dee about my father’s involvement, she said, was less its grotesquerie than its banality — inequality reproduces itself not through exceptional villains but through routine transactions that feel apolitical or even benevolent. Dee Dee illuminated what capitalism had worked to keep hidden from me as a white gay man from a well-off family: the American project has privatized survival and normalized extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, the political lessons of the epidemic have been softened and repackaged. Pharmaceutical companies sponsor World AIDS Day commemorations. Corporations wrap themselves in red ribbons. A once-militant care network and expansive political movement — born of mutual aid, tenant organizing, and anti-racist struggle — has been professionalized into a philanthropic–nonprofit industrial complex. ACT UP’s core insight — that AIDS was a political crisis created by austerity, racism, and homophobia — has been replaced by narratives of individual resilience, medical heroism, or depoliticized awareness (“So sad what happened. . .”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this sanitized remembrance makes it harder to recognize echoes of AIDS history when we hear them in the present. HIV programs now face deep cuts under a second Trump administration. Obamacare tax credits are set to expire, threatening the only affordable coverage millions have. The unwinding of Medicaid has thrown millions more off the rolls. Long COVID patients are being denied disability benefits at staggering rates. Medical-debt start-ups, private equity–backed emergency rooms, and for-profit hospice chains repeat the viatical logic in updated form: when the state abandons people, the market monetizes the fallout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As public infrastructure is gutted once again, new markets will continue to form around the needs the state refuses to meet. Our most pressing question isn’t whether individuals will behave well within those markets. It’s why we’ve allowed our politics to make markets the arbiters of who gets to live with dignity — and who gets to live at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This World AIDS Day, we must resist a sentimental remembering of the epidemic. As we sink into another period of austerity, another effort to dismantle the minimal protections won through decades of struggle, we must remember accurately. The political lesson that AIDS activists fought to teach us was simple: the market alone cannot keep people alive, housed, and cared for. That is a collective responsibility — and a political choice. To honor the millions lost to the epidemic, we must confront the conditions that made the logic of viaticals possible, then and now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Jacobin</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 18:20:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5lX1lsM092MzI3MDFsSEpZbWRNeS1mN256R1RLc21KYWliTUw3czAtSzI5SkUxazNtT1A5WWNrSlhuTXFzNGQwbEtDT2JBSWdjY29vZnhnWXA0bVZYV2hiVm1PSDQ5T1UxREF6UzhDNA</guid></item><item><title>流行的Alt-Med彩信在“治疗性”剂量下有毒，科学家警告- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/popular-alt-med-mms-is-toxic-at-therapeutic-doses-scientists-warn-2000693940</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A remedy popular in the world of alternative medicine known as “Miracle Mineral Solution”—or MMS—is anything but a miracle, recent research finds. Rather, it could be dangerous to users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Wroclaw Medical University in Poland examined the effects of acidified sodium chlorite, the base ingredient of Miracle Mineral Solution, on various bacteria. Though the compound could effectively destroy bacteria, it did so at doses that also killed off living cells and lab animals. The findings suggest that MMS is far from the safe cure-all that its advocates claim it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have shown that the dosage recommended by alternative medicine proponents cannot lead to the achievement of safe and therapeutic concentrations,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-01852-z"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Scientific Reports.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The miracle that isn’t&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;MMS was first popularized in the mid-2000s by author and former Scientologist &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/205434855158"&gt;Jim Humble&lt;/a&gt;. The concoction mixes sodium chlorite distilled in water with an acid, which then results in chlorine dioxide, a bleaching agent that’s commonly used as a disinfectant.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Humble and other proponents have claimed that chlorine dioxide/MMS can treat just about every medical condition under the Sun, from autism to HIV. But these claims have never been verified by rigorous studies, nor has MMS ever been approved for medical use.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Health officials have long &lt;a href="https://www.empr.com/home/news/safety-alerts-and-recalls/fda-warns-of-cure-all-products-that-actually-contain-bleach/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; the public to stay away from MMS, while law enforcement agencies have periodically gone after its marketers. In 2023, for instance, several members of the Grenon family in Florida were &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/doj-press-releases-involving-fda-oci/leaders-genesis-ii-church-health-and-healing-who-sold-toxic-bleach-fake-miracle-cure-covid-19-and"&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to federal prison for illegally promoting and distributing MMS as a cure for covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The scientists behind the new study say not enough work has been done to verify the medicinal effects of MMS, particularly on bacteria. So they tested out two different forms of MMS (created with two different acids) on several bacterial species, including disease-causing strains of &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, as well as probiotic bacteria. MMS was also tested for its cytotoxicity, or its ability to harm eukaryotic cells (cells containing a nucleus).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MMS could reliably destroy harmful bacteria, the researchers found, and even break apart bacterial biofilms, hardy clumps of bacteria that are usually much more resistant to antibiotics. But the dosages required for this effectiveness appeared to be toxic to human cells, while moth larvae exposed to the compound often died. MMS also killed off probiotic bacteria, suggesting it could disturb the body’s normal microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings imply that MMS “applied in humans can lead to damage to the mucous membrane of the gastrointestinal tract,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A toxic cure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000693998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000693998" class="wp-caption alignright"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000693998" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/mms-miracle-cure-or-t-1.jpg" alt="Mms Miracle Cure Or T 1" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/mms-miracle-cure-or-t-1.jpg 1414w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/mms-miracle-cure-or-t-1-238x336.jpg 238w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/mms-miracle-cure-or-t-1-905x1280.jpg 905w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/mms-miracle-cure-or-t-1-768x1086.jpg 768w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/mms-miracle-cure-or-t-1-475x672.jpg 475w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/mms-miracle-cure-or-t-1-679x960.jpg 679w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/12/mms-miracle-cure-or-t-1-1131x1600.jpg 1131w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000693998" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An educational graphic prepared by the Wroclaw Medical University team. © Wroclaw Medical University&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge it could theoretically be possible to create a form of acidified sodium chlorite helpful against bacteria that isn’t harmful to people. But it’s certainly not the version that people today are taking. And much like other experts, they’re advising everyone to not fall for the hype beyond MMS.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“In pharmacy and medicine, the benefit-risk ratio is considered. In the case of MMS, the benefit is zero, and the risk is high, especially since the dosage is often administered using non-standardized droppers, which can achieve 1 ml by applying 15 or 30 drops. Such fluctuations in the oral dosage of a corrosive substance are extremely irresponsible,” said study author Ruth Dudek-Wicher, a pharmacologist specializing in microbiology and parasitology, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-11-miracle-mineral-solution-amazing-toxic.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the old adage goes: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

But while eligible adults generally should get them, pregnant women should not use them, the WHO stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Limits on global production capacity mean that now only at most about 100 million people could receive the drugs – only 10% of the 1 billion who could benefit. The number of people deemed obese – based on a body mass index of 30 or more – is due to double from 1 billion to 2 billion by 2030, and the costs worldwide to hit $3tn by the same date, it warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also warned that pharmaceutical companies would have to lower the prices they charge for Mounjaro, Ozempic and similar drugs and hugely expand production of them to avoid people in the world’s poorer countries being denied them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“While medication alone won’t solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO set out its thinking on the drugs for the first time in a “special communication” aimed at health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“GLP-1 therapies mark more than a scientific breakthrough. They represent a new chapter in the gradual conceptual shift in how society approaches obesity – from a ‘lifestyle condition’ to a complex, preventable and treatable chronic disease,” its statement in the Journal of the American Medical Association said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“GLP-1 therapies … have emerged as an important innovation in addressing the global obesity challenge. The advent of these medications represents a tipping point in the treatment of obesity, its complications and related co-morbidities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO’s statement was written by three leading doctors: Francesca Celletti, Luz De Regil and Jeremy Farrar, its assistant director for health promotion and disease prevention and control, who was previously its chief scientist and also the director of the Wellcome scientific institute in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It stressed that the drugs on their own were not enough to reverse obesity and that people using them should also eat more healthily, exercise more and have counselling about their lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The WHO accepts the growing evidence that GLP-1s can help reduce the risk of a range of serious and potentially fatal events and conditions including heart attacks and strokes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, bad cholesterol, sleep apnoea and kidney and arterial disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Three “major barriers” must be overcome to ensure that everyone globally whose health would benefit from GLP-1s can get them: lack of production capacity, availability and affordability; health systems’ preparedness to provide them; and universal access to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Weight loss drugs have an important role to play, but they are not a silver bullet,” said Katherine Jenner, the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 health, medical and children’s organisations in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In the UK right now, access is still limited, supply is fragile, and NHS use is tightly targeted.

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial vaccine advisory committee will be meeting later this week under a new chairperson, federal officials announced Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Kulldorff is leaving the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to take a leadership role within the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, who has blamed vaccines for causing cardiovascular disease, will become the new chair. He had been appointed to the committee in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later this week, the committee is scheduled to discuss the pediatric vaccine schedule and hepatitis B shots given to newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HHS officials issued a press release praising Kulldorff and his work while leading the panel but did not answer additional questions about the changes. Kulldorff did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy has remade the committee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee makes recommendations to the director of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-director-susan-monarez-50dfbec849b53b4593755d2e6e616687"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee’s recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;replaced it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Kulldorff’s leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/thimerosal-mercury-vaccine-preservative-7626ec1455ad98228cf8b041f6388bab"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the group recommended &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-vaccines-acip-hepatitis-b-chickenpox-21623ff8ead38ae1b21db488ee82a1f8"&gt;new restrictions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-advisers-vaccines-hepatitis-b-covid19-a1fb61ef7e29d93d2828618d890cceb3"&gt;unprecedented step&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations — not even for high-risk populations like seniors — instead making it a matter of personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several doctors’ groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-vaccines-aap-cdc-33896013e1d7b3ad06dbd0d99d300bff"&gt;follow guidance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that was previously in place.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Kulldorff is moving to an HHS role &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff’s departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rfk-gold-standard-science-research-autism-6e4c6bc2534252ab1e7add0942043778"&gt;traditional&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “evidence-to-recommendation” framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new role, Kulldorff will become chief science officer within the HHS planning and evaluation office. Officials described the office as the department’s “in-house think tank.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to contributing to the science-based public health policies that will Make America Healthy Again,” Kulldorff said in the HHS press release.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Committee is expected to vote on hepatitis shots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine committee is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday in Atlanta, with a vote expected on whether to change the recommendation on shots for newborns against hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s unclear exactly what the committee plans to vote on. HHS officials have not responded to repeated questions seeking details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current recommendations call for a first dose to be given to newborns within 24 hours of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, 15 state governors submitted public comments suggesting the committee was hurting public trust in vaccines and the ability of people to get affordable shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles while injecting drugs. But the virus can also be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections that can lead to a lifetime of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccinations are considered a success, and experts say no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in September, Kennedy’s ACIP members discussed whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination — something doctors and parents already can choose to do. The panel pulled back from taking a vote amid criticism from independent pediatric and infectious disease specialists who say the vaccine is safe and has helped infant infections drop sharply.&lt;/p&gt;

But a sweeping new review of 121 studies suggests that approach may miss the real picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Neurophysiology (&lt;a href="https://ihna.ru/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IHNA&lt;/a&gt;) in Moscow report that OCD is better explained as five tightly related conditions. Each one is linked to its own neural circuits, genetic signatures, and cognitive traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift could reshape how clinicians understand the disorder and how they tailor treatment for the people living with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-five-subtypes-reshape-ocd"&gt;Five subtypes reshape OCD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades of independent research show four stable clusters, including contamination and cleaning, doubt and checking, symmetry and ordering, and unacceptable thoughts with mental rituals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review adds a fifth group focused on taboo &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-helps-prevent-unwanted-memories-from-popping-up/"&gt;intrusive thoughts&lt;/a&gt;, helping clinicians tell OCD cases apart more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with OCD – a condition of unwanted thoughts and repetitive actions – often feel trapped by a cycle of fear and relief. Symptoms can consume hours each day and push aside school, work, and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review organizes findings across the five groups without mixing them into a single average. That design lets differences stand out instead of being lost in the noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-distinct-brain-signatures-emerge"&gt;Distinct brain signatures emerge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One functional magnetic resonance imaging study showed distinct activity maps for washing, checking, and hoarding triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“OCD may be best conceptualized as a spectrum of multiple, potentially overlapping syndromes rather than a unitary nosologic entity,” said D. Mataix-Cols, the study’s lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contamination and cleaning concerns often stir the insula, which helps encode disgust and bodily unease. Symmetry and ordering more often recruit sensorimotor networks that judge whether actions feel complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taboo, intrusive thoughts tend to engage emotion-focused frontal areas and the amygdala. That matches how intensely shame and threat can register when those images strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genetic-clues-behind-ocd"&gt;Genetic clues behind OCD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the surface, brain cells talk using neurotransmitters, chemical messengers that carry signals between neurons in the brain. Evidence suggests that glutamate, serotonin, and dopamine play different roles across the five groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One glutamate transporter gene called SLC1A1 has been tied to the condition in families and population samples. The signal is strongest when hoarding features are present, pointing to an altered balance in excitatory signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well-known enzyme variant, the COMT Val158Met genotype, shows up more often when hoarding is the dominant problem. Lower enzyme activity can raise dopamine tone in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/prefrontal-cortex-treating-alcoholism/"&gt;frontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks with difficulty switching gears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin-related variants may be more common in people with symmetry and ordering compulsions. A growth factor signal called brain-derived neurotrophic factor may also affect how threat memories stick or fade with practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-tying-brain-to-action"&gt;Signals tying brain to action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists use the word endophenotype – a measurable trait that links genes to symptoms – to describe mid-layer signals that bridge biology and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/neurobiotic-sixth-sense-gut-brain-connection-flagellin-plays-vital-role-behavior-appetite/"&gt;behavior&lt;/a&gt;. Examples include reaction-time patterns, brain-wave rhythms, and resting-activity maps in specific circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the five groups, certain traits repeat enough to be clinically useful. People who check a lot report more doubt about mistakes, while those drawn to symmetry often report a nagging sense that things are not “just right.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cognitive tests also split by group. Planning, inhibitory control, and flexible thinking vary in small but consistent ways that match the main complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the signals across imaging, genetics, and behavior point in the same direction. The five groups look distinct at each level of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-paths-for-ocd-therapy"&gt;New paths for OCD therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medication that boosts &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-dopamine-and-serotonin-shape-behavior/"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; remains a standard first-line treatment. Many people benefit and then relapse less, but some still need more help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most supported talk therapy is exposure and response prevention, a form of cognitive behavioral therapy that teaches new habits by facing triggers without rituals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence across symptom dimensions shows solid gains, with special planning needed for taboo-thought cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing the leading subtype can shape what to try first and how to adjust. A person high in symmetry and ordering may need exercises that target not just fear, but the drive for exactness and the relief of a “just right” feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When hoarding is central in this condition, clearer decisions about possessions often require slower pacing and choices in the actual home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When unacceptable thoughts dominate, sessions may spend more time on shame, guilt, and hidden mental rituals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-next-steps-in-ocd-research"&gt;Next steps in OCD research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five-group map is not a label to carve in stone. People carry mixes of symptoms, and the pattern can shift over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the categories are steady enough to plan better studies and treatment trials. A clear map also helps families understand why two people with the same diagnosis can respond to very different tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will test whether blood-based markers or task-based &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/neuromorphic-computing-where-ai-meets-human-brain/"&gt;brain signatures&lt;/a&gt; can sort people before treatment begins. That step could speed recovery by matching strengths and needs from day one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians also need screening questions that catch hidden rituals in unacceptable thoughts. Early recognition can prevent months of confusion and delayed care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/17/8578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 17:25:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNNVNqbFV5RDdmMG1fV0R3UFdsRWVfbFczODBEeWNCQ3paRWtoSm5lNzNJaE9Gb1hSN0JFOEIxSnhLSmFsNkxGLWctMEljWm1ibDVhc3JrQVdWYXpfQ1dfTGt0Z0MtdUxpRVl2VnJWa0ZhakZtQ09DUmNCbnFjNXR0N1NnSWpNRUQ5cXdrVnV3MHltcnIzZ1FpbnJPaTNaSFZYNi1OUnY4TDd3TmdyT1RWbjljU0c</guid></item><item><title>专栏|作为一名医生，以下是我以科学为基础的简单健康日程安排--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/12/01/scientific-daily-routine/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IA4CMWEZ2RBPHNI2JEJLSHQCKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can I organize my day so I can feel as good as possible?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B546VOV7ABGCTCGYKRWVNFCVZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The morning routines and “biohacks” you see on social media can seem extreme and often oversell the science.

It has &lt;a href="https://www.americangene.com/blog/why-is-it-so-difficult-to-find-an-hiv-cure/"&gt;a few strategies&lt;/a&gt; that make it extremely difficult to treat, including rapid mutation and an ability to &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/drug-resistance"&gt;evolve drug resistance&lt;/a&gt; if therapy isn't maintained perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183528" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-micrograph.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-183528" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-micrograph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-micrograph-600x446.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183528" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;3D-printed model of an HIV particle (right) next to a colored micrograph image of an infected cell. (&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HIV_Virus_-_2.jpg"&gt;NIAID/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV exploits a receptor called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.296.7.815"&gt;CCR5&lt;/a&gt; to attach to and enter the host's cells. Once inside, it buries its DNA in the genome. The virus can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hivs-cunning-strategy-for-hiding-in-our-body-finally-revealed"&gt;remain dormant within&lt;/a&gt; some long-lived immune cells for years, creating a &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/what-latent-hiv-reservoir"&gt;latent reservoir&lt;/a&gt; of the virus in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reservoirs of HIV are essentially invisible to the immune system and untouched by antiretroviral therapy (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/antiretroviral-therapy"&gt;ART&lt;/a&gt;), the drugs that stop HIV from replicating. If a patient stops taking regular doses of ART, any remaining virus hiding in that reservoir can re-emerge and reignite the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full stem cell transplants uniquely primed to circumvent these strategies have had a proven record in depleting these reservoirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the patient undergoes an aggressive course of chemotherapy to wipe out most of their immune system, including a significant number of the cells containing hidden copies of the HIV genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, a transplant of donor stem cells rebuilds the immune system from scratch. Those new cells can recognize the few remaining HIV hideouts and wipe them out through a phenomenon known as a graft-versus-reservoir response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In five of the seven known cases of long-term HIV remission –  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-first-person-to-be-cured-of-hiv-has-passed-away-from-cancer"&gt;the Berlin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv-cured-london-man-still-has-no-trace-of-infection-nearly-3-years-after-treatment"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/another-person-has-been-cured-of-hiv-almost-a-decade-after-treatment"&gt;Duesseldorf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-us-woman-could-be-the-third-person-cured-of-hiv-this-time-using-umbilical-blood"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-fourth-person-is-effectively-cured-of-hiv-following-a-stem-cell-transplant"&gt;City of Hope, California&lt;/a&gt; patients – the stem cell donors had two copies of a rare mutation called CCR5 Δ32.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_183527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-183527" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-attachment.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-183527" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-attachment.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/hiv-attachment-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-183527" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;An illustration of HIV (left) attaching itself to a cell. (&lt;a href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/enep9d4h/images?id=w7u2swun"&gt;David S. Goodsell, The Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation essentially breaks the CCR5 'keyhole' HIV attaches to, preventing the virus from entering in the first place. With two mutated copies of CCR5 – one inherited from each parent – donated immune cells lack any functioning CCR5 receptors, preventing HIV from unlocking the door and depriving the virus of new places to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B2 already had one copy of the CCR5 Δ32 mutation that he'd inherited from a parent. Nonetheless, he was diagnosed with HIV in 2009 and, after falling ill in 2015, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors found a matching stem cell donor, though they also had just one copy of the mutation. So B2 underwent chemotherapy and a full stem cell transplant later that year. His condition improved to the point that, in 2018, and against medical advice, he stopped taking ART. This marks the beginning of his remission timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the virus levels in B2's body have remained undetectable and may even be nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case suggests that double copies of CCR5 Δ32 are not a requirement for durable HIV remission after stem cell treatment, and that the graft-versus-reservoir response may work in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggestion is supported by the sixth patient, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sixth-hiv-patient-declared-in-remission-will-need-to-be-watched-closely"&gt;a man from Geneva&lt;/a&gt; whose stem cell donor lacked the CCR5 Δ32 allele entirely. He stopped taking ART in 2021 and remains in remission at the time of reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.aidsmap.com/news/mar-2014/boston-patients-experience-hiv-rebound-after-stem-cell-transplants"&gt;two patients from Boston&lt;/a&gt; who also received stem cell transplants from regular CCR5 donors experienced viral rebound, indicating the need for further investigation to understand what's happening in these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCR5 Δ32 stem cell procedure is unlikely to become a standard treatment for HIV patients. Chemotherapy and full stem cell transplant are tough on the body, with a relatively high risk of lifelong health complications and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, its success could inform treatments that exploit similar mechanisms. The Geneva patient and B2's cases are exciting because they shift the focus away from finding rare unicorn donors to the question of how to replicate reservoir reduction, partial CCR5 protection, and graft-versus-reservoir responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These may all be achievable through pharmaceutical treatments and gene editing, and research is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI144486"&gt;already underway&lt;/a&gt; to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the case of the second Berlin patient B2 suggests that significant reductions of persistent reservoirs can lead to HIV cure independent of homozygous CCR5Δ32-mediated viral resistance," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09893-0"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This underscores the critical importance of modulating and potentially eliminating the HIV reservoir in strategies aimed at long-term remission and cure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results have been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09893-0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A third infant death from pertussis &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/pertussis/third-infant-kentucky-dies-whooping-cough-national-cases-stay-high-second-year-row" target="_blank"&gt;In Kentucky&lt;/a&gt; comes as cases are high for the second year in a row.  The national total this year is over 25,000, which is believed to be an undercount.  Many cases go unrecognized or unreported, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bactrim or Septra is associated with a heightened risk &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/common-antibiotic-linked-risk-acute-respiratory-failure-kids-young-adults" target="_blank"&gt;Of acute respiratory failure&lt;/a&gt; in children and teens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts are now warning that the H5N1 bird flu &lt;a href="https://cambodianess.com/article/a-mutating-threat-scientists-warn-h5n1-bird-flu-is-evolving-faster-than-ever" target="_blank"&gt;Is mutating rapidly&lt;/a&gt;, splitting into multiple strains, and infecting mammal species at an unprecedented scale.  This makes preparation for any potential pandemic harder because we don't know what the strain will look like that makes the breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And viable virus has been &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.11.28.689408v1" target="_blank"&gt;Isolated from soft-bodied ticks feeding on infected gulls.&lt;/a&gt;  It is not yet clear if ticks could be a vector or if this is a dead-end host for the virus.  But ticks are good at spreading lots of other things...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food recalls:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The world is a few steps closer to a cure for HIV, a hopeful sign illuminated by two studies published Monday that feature the work of several Seattle researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The papers, which appear in the journal Nature, present new evidence of long-term, potential treatments for the virus that causes AIDS. The work was published on &lt;a href="https://worldaidsday.org/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt;, an international event marked every year on the first of December, when people aim to raise awareness of the epidemic, salute ongoing efforts toward a cure and remember lives lost. This year is the first since 1988 the United States will not commemorate the day, per a U.S. State Department directive, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/health/trump-us-world-aids-day.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;The New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies bring together formidable teams of more than 40 scientists, clinicians, pharmacologists, statisticians and others from all over the world who have dedicated much of their careers to HIV research, including two researchers at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and two from the University of Washington. The findings are cause for celebration, said Lillian Cohn, an immunologist and assistant professor at Fred Hutch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the country’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/25/health/hiv-lenacapavir-vaccine-trump-cuts-africa.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;fading support&lt;/a&gt; of crucial HIV programs is hard to ignore, said Cohn, who studies how the immune system works to fight the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in a very paradoxical moment in the world,” she said. “The science is at the best point it’s ever been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, researchers are watching an “incredible pullback in both leadership positions within the government that support this kind of work and in actual funding,” she said. “For those of us in the field, it honestly feels very dire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09929-5" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;paper Cohn worked&lt;/a&gt; on highlights work toward a new treatment — a combination immunotherapy — that merges three separate, previously studied approaches, and appears to effectively mean long-term remission for people living with HIV without having to take ongoing medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, scientists have made lifesaving advances around prevention and treatment, including the creation of medication that suppresses HIV to undetectable levels, blocks transmission and prevents the development of AIDS. That medicine, known as antiretroviral therapy, was a turning point for the fight against the virus and is still used today, most commonly as a daily pill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if people living with HIV stop that treatment, most will immediately rebound, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the goal of this study was to try several back-to-back strategies that could hopefully help the immune system better fight the virus on its own, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead investigators, based at the University of California, San Francisco, “basically threw the kitchen sink at this problem,” Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, researchers gave participants a therapeutic vaccine. Next, they received a compound designed to help wake the sleeping infected cells. Then, they were given a broadly neutralizing antibody, or bnAb, which are powerful antibodies that block many strains of the quickly mutating HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then they stopped treatment in these people and watched what happened,” Cohn said. “And what happened was honestly pretty miraculous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that 7 in 10 participants were able to control their virus in a “completely different way,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size is small, and there are still questions about how widespread this treatment could be, Cohn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it’s a proof-of-principle that it’s possible to do this,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09893-0" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;other paper published Monday&lt;/a&gt; reveals a finding around another rare case of a possible “cure” in a patient from Berlin, said Daniel Reeves, who worked on the study and researches infectious disease and evolutionary biology using mathematical models at Fred Hutch. To date, there are fewer than 10 known instances of long-term remission from HIV without ongoing treatment, Reeves said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study centers on an emerging treatment that involves stem cell transplants from donors with an uncommon genetic mutation — but a version that differs slightly from one scientists had studied in the past. This therapy targets a specific group: people living with HIV who also have cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 20 years, various transplant methods have played a key role in the search for an HIV cure. The first person in the world reported to be cured of the virus, &lt;a href="https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2020/09/timothy-ray-brown-obit.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;a man originally from Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, underwent a bone marrow transplant in Berlin in 2007 after being diagnosed with leukemia. The procedure involved receiving stem cells from a donor who carried a mutation that provides natural resistance to HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation, known as delta 32, occurs in about 5% to 10% of northern and some southern Europeans, Reeves said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study offers a notable difference from past transplants. &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;The Seattle man, Timothy Ray Brown — who was initially introduced to the world as the “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/health/timothy-ray-brown-first-patient-cured-of-hiv-dies-at-54.html" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;Berlin patient&lt;/a&gt;” — received stem cells from someone with a particular type of delta 32, a homozygous version that means there were two copies of the mutation in their genome, Reeves said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this most recent patient, who also underwent care in Berlin, received a transplant from a donor with a heterozygous delta 32, meaning they had just one copy of the mutation, which is about 10 times more common. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That opens the door to a bigger donor pool,” Reeves said. “There’s a lot more people that have just one copy of this mutation versus both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure is very expensive and dangerous, involving full-body radiation and chemotherapy to deplete a person’s cells, which is why it’s not widely accessible to the average person living with HIV, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Fred Hutch researchers noted the process has been attempted many times over the years, following the success of Brown’s case, and few have worked out the same way. There’s still much to be understood about why. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, another Berlin patient appears to have reached long-term remission, with no detectable virus for at least six years, Reeves said. This person is not currently being identified, but is a man who received a stem cell transplant for leukemia in 2015; in late 2018, he stopped taking antiretroviral medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both papers demonstrate valuable strides, Reeves and Cohn emphasized these treatments are not yet scalable or realistic for all 40 million-plus people living with HIV throughout the world. The work continues, they say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the future of related projects is at risk, largely due to &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-pepfar/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;freezes on programs like PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, first authorized in 2003 by then-President George W. Bush. PEPFAR is &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar-latest-global-results-factsheet-dec-2024/" target="_blank" class="content-link external"&gt;credited&lt;/a&gt; with having saved 26 million lives and providing HIV treatment for millions of people across 55 countries, according to the State Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The community is so strong and interconnected now,” Reeves said. “The amount everyone knows is just amazing, and all that feels optimistic and hopeful. So to imagine pulling back from that — the de-prioritization of this work — feels extra painful.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It may be best to take vitamin D in the morning because taking it at night might reduce melatonin production. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most foods do not have enough vitamin D to meet people's needs, so supplements can help fill the gap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider taking vitamin D during darker months when the sun is less intense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Taking vitamin D in the morning is most beneficial, as evening intake may interfere with melatonin production and impact sleep quality. For most adults, a daily dose of 600 IU to 800 IU is typically recommended; however, individual needs may vary.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that taking vitamin D in the morning may be more effective than in the evening, as evening intake can reduce melatonin production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Melatonin helps you feel sleepy, while vitamin D and melatonin work in opposition. Sun exposure affects your vitamin D levels, which in turn regulate melatonin production.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Conversely, melatonin production increases when there's less sunlight, such as during winter or at higher latitudes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, your vitamin D levels can influence your sleep, with &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-deficiency-3014720" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low levels&lt;/a&gt; contributing to poor sleep quality and duration.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While your body absorbs vitamin D within 24 hours, peak levels typically occur 7 to 14 days after supplementation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additional research is needed to understand the interaction between vitamin D and your circadian rhythm, as well as whether this influences the optimal time of day for supplementation.

Excessive vitamin D intake can lead to very high calcium levels, which may cause vomiting, muscle weakness, dehydration, and kidney stones, among other symptoms. In severe cases, vitamin D toxicity causes kidney failure, irregular heartbeat, soft tissue calcification, and even death. Vitamin D toxicity occurs from regularly taking high-dose vitamin D supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-d-8348470" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods naturally contain vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, whereas others are fortified. Natural sources of vitamin D include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cod liver oil&lt;/strong&gt; (450 IU per teaspoon)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Farmed rainbow trout&lt;/strong&gt; (645 IU per cooked 3-ounce serving)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mushrooms&lt;/strong&gt; (0.4 IU per cup of sliced white mushrooms)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sardines&lt;/strong&gt; (180 IU per 3.75-ounce can serving)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sockeye salmon&lt;/strong&gt; (570 IU per cooked 3-ounce serving)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortified foods have vitamin D added to boost the nutritional content. Fortified sources of vitamin D include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almond milk&lt;/strong&gt; (105 IU per 8-ounce serving)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast cereals&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;2% cow’s milk&lt;/strong&gt; (110 IU per 8-ounce serving)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orange juice&lt;/strong&gt; (105 IU per 8-ounce serving)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy milk&lt;/strong&gt; (110 IU per 8-ounce serving)&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on your current vitamin D levels, you may need a supplement. They come in various dosages, with some exceeding the tolerable upper limit of 4,000 IU per day. Avoid taking more than 4,000 IUs of vitamin D daily unless your healthcare provider advises.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D supplements are available as &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/vitamin-d-two-vs-d-three-7095309" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)&lt;/a&gt;. Some research suggests that vitamin D3 is better at maintaining circulating nutrient levels during the fall and winter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you live in the northern hemisphere, you may want to consider evaluating your vitamin D levels and possibly supplementing from October through March.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most multivitamins contain 400 to 600 IU of vitamin D, around the daily amount needed for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, choose a supplement based on your vitamin D blood test results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Sunlight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight. Ultraviolet (UV) rays activate &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/does-vitamin-d-supplement-make-skin-darker-11680093" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin D3 in the skin&lt;/a&gt;, turning it into its active form. To get vitamin D from the sun, expose your face, arms, hands, and legs to sunlight between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. for at least five to 30 minutes, twice a week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, balancing skin damage from the sun with vitamin D production is challenging. Using sunscreen can prevent your body from producing vitamin D.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-who-needs-a-vitamin-d-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Who Needs a Vitamin D Supplement? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specific populations are particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency. Understanding these risks can help inform your dietary choices and the need for supplementation to support your overall health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; People with the following should consider their vitamin D intake and, potentially, a supplement:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited sun exposure&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Vitamin D levels are impacted by clothing, sunscreen use, latitude, and season. People covering their bodies or using high SPF sunscreens absorb less vitamin D from sunlight. In winter, particularly at latitudes above 37 degrees, decreased sunlight and increased clothing lead to lower vitamin D synthesis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dark skin pigmentation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Melanin, the compound responsible for skin pigmentation, causes individuals with darker skin to absorb less UV light, making it more challenging to produce vitamin D.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt;: Vitamin D needs are not increased during pregnancy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Most prenatal supplements contain some vitamin D to ensure a pregnant person gets enough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism&lt;/strong&gt;: Some studies suggest that people with autism may have lower vitamin D levels and would benefit from supplementation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At risk of type 1 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the pancreas fails to produce insulin. Research suggests that vitamin D may help protect insulin-producing cells. Maintaining adequate vitamin D levels may reduce the risk of developing type 1 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Vitamin D supports glucose metabolism, and low levels are linked to an increased risk and progression of type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conditions that impact fat or vitamin absorption&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Changes to the gastrointestinal tract that affect absorption impact vitamin D levels. People with short bowel disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, and, to a lesser extent, ulcerative colitis, tend to have lower circulating vitamin D levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastric bypass surgery&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Bariatric surgery (weight loss surgery) changes the structure of the gastrointestinal tract. This affects nutrient absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Older adults&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The body’s ability to produce vitamin D from the sun decreases with age. Additionally, older adults may be less likely to spend significant time outdoors, especially during peak sun hours.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The risk of bone loss increases with age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity&lt;/strong&gt;: Low vitamin D levels can occur among people living with obesity due to multiple factors, including less time outdoors in the sunlight, reduced vitamin D intake, impaired liver production of vitamin D, and increased storage of vitamin D in fat (adipose) cells.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian or vegan diet&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;A vegetarian or vegan diet may provide inadequate vitamin D, especially if it excludes eggs, dairy, and fortified foods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol use disorder (AUD)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Vitamin D deficiency is common among people with AUD. Moreover, vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for liver damage and impaired blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific medications&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Taking vitamin D with statin medications that lower cholesterol may reduce the medication’s effectiveness. Thiazide diuretics decrease the removal of calcium from the body. Vitamin D supplements increase calcium absorption, so taking vitamin D with thiazide diuretics may lead to elevated calcium (hypercalcemia).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;When Prof Bullmore joined King’s College in the 1990s, the view was very much that schizophrenia was a mind problem, because unlike Alzheimer’s – where “the brain will be visibly shrunken” – in schizophrenia, “there’s nothing you can see under the microscope that’s a clear-cut abnormality.” In the 2010s, when new brain scan methods first emerged and big statistical analyses could be carried out on a number of different studies using them, scientists found a definitive difference in the brains of people with schizophrenia: reduced grey matter and cortical thickness (the outer layer of the brain), in the frontal and temporal lobes in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Prof Bullmore’s work has shown that the most important thing is the connections between neurons, which are not directly visible in brain scans. In childhood, these networks form very quickly and are pruned back during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s where you get into trying to understand, how do our brains normally develop? And that shifts your attention to the early years of life, because that’s the prime time for brain development.” Around 10 years ago, it was discovered that this pruning is actually done by the brain’s own immune cells. In Alzheimer’s too, “the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/the-best-supplements-healthy-ageing/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; starts getting inflamed and effectively attacking these odd proteins [amyloid plaques] that have appeared in the brain, and that probably contributes to the damage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding explained a lot of strange discoveries in the field. Such as that “if you were born in the winter, you had a higher risk of developing schizophrenia. It was very difficult to say why – it sounded a little like astrology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missing link, Prof Bullmore believes, is that infections contracted in childhood (or even in the womb) are interrupting the normal pruning of these networks, in children who already have a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia. According to twin studies, the condition seems to be about 70 per cent down to genetics, the remaining 30 per cent leaving space for whether these genes are “switched on” or not. Viral infections that affect the central nervous system, such as influenza and rubella, are especially likely to be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/08/childhood-trauma-expert-benjamin-perks/"&gt;Childhood trauma&lt;/a&gt; seems to have a similar effect. “Like infection, trauma could impact on brain development at that particularly critical early phase,” Prof Bullmore explains. And like an infection, early trauma “marks your genome, and it makes a difference to which of the genes you’ve inherited are expressed and turned into proteins, and become part of who you are”. Somehow it “literally gets under the skin”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How cannabis and AI can could pose a danger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Prof Bullmore’s ideas about schizophrenia were formed when he was a young man, in the canteen of the institute of psychiatry at King’s. That was where he’d hear about new kinds of technology, such as MRI scans, or new statistical methods that could reveal clues about how schizophrenia develops. In some ways the canteen has changed – there’s a neon sign and the walls are painted orange, “and it’s much busier with students than it used to be” – but in many ways it feels like his old stamping ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Prof Bullmore recently heard from a colleague over lunch that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/artificial-intelligence/"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) chatbots have reportedly been causing psychosis across the world. Like many experts, he thinks that the technology really could pose a danger to young people’s developing minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think it’s ultimately causal, but I think it’s another thing that could nudge the expression of risk to a clinical manifestation in the form of psychotic symptoms,” he says, much like cannabis use, which has long been blamed for cases of schizophrenia in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, “teenage cannabis use is associated with a modestly increased risk of later psychotic illness” – but, he insists, “it’s not a massive effect.” While smoking increases a person’s risk of lung cancer 20-fold, for example, cannabis use might increase risk of psychosis by two or three times in people already vulnerable to it through genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which could be more dangerous in the long run? “It’s too early to say,” he admits. When it comes to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/27/doctors-fear-chatgpt-fuelling-psychosis/"&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, “I can easily imagine how [deluded thoughts] could come back to you reinforced, corroborated, so you begin to put more evidential weight on that way of thinking about things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Can schizophrenia be cured?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is usually thought of as a lifelong condition, but “the rule of thumb we used to share with people was that a third of people will make a complete recovery after a first psychotic illness,” Prof Bullmore says. At present, “another third might have intermittent psychotic symptoms at times throughout the rest of their lives, but it really won’t have a major impact, and the final third will show long-term disability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Bullmore has also worked with the pharmaceutical company GSK. An exciting new drug for the depressive symptoms of schizophrenia is about to hit the market, he says, and he has a lot of hope that old drugs for different treatments could be repurposed. When it comes to Alzheimer’s, he is even more optimistic. He expects to see “a new drug to slow down the neurodegeneration of Alzheimer’s quite soon, perhaps within a decade”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes for people diagnosed with schizophrenia could also change, and numbers of cases could come down, with the right public health policies focused on prevention. Prof Bullmore points to phenylketonuria (PKU), a serious condition all babies are screened for at birth in Britain. Children born with PKU are put on a special diet to help them avoid phenylalanine, a compound found in protein-rich food such as meat and eggs, as eating it causes them &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/01/31/three-mild-blows-head-linked-lifelong-damage-attention-span/"&gt;brain damage&lt;/a&gt;. Those who avoid large amounts of phenylalanine go on to live normal, healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to illnesses thought of as mental health issues too, “I think there are proper opportunities for taking everything that comes out of universities and turning it into meaningful innovations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Divided Mind: Uncovering Psychiatry’s Dark Past – and Reimagining Its Future, published by New River, is out now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Without decisive action, the number of people with obesity is projected to double by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 2025, WHO added GLP-1 therapies to its Essential Medicines List for &lt;a href="/news/item/05-09-2025-who-updates-list-of-essential-medicines-to-include-key-cancer--diabetes-treatments"&gt;managing type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; in high-risk groups. With the new guideline, WHO issues conditional recommendations for using these therapies to support people living with obesity in overcoming this serious health challenge, as part of a comprehensive approach that includes healthy diets, regular physical activity and support from health professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obesity is a major global health challenge that WHO is committed to addressing by supporting countries and people worldwide to control it, effectively and equitably. Our new guidance recognizes that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “While medication alone won’t solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity is a complex, chronic disease and a major driver of noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. It also contributes to poorer outcomes of patients who have infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its health impacts, the global economic cost of obesity is predicted to reach US$ 3 trillion annually by 2030. The guideline can help efforts to reduce skyrocketing health costs associated with managing the condition and associated health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Landmark policy change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new WHO guidance contains two key conditional recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;GLP-1 therapies may be used by adults, but excluding pregnant women, for the long-term treatment of obesity. While the efficacy of these therapies in treating obesity and improving metabolic and other outcomes was evident, the recommendation is conditional due to limited data on their long-term efficacy and safety, maintenance and discontinuation, their current costs, inadequate health-system preparedness, and potential equity implications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intensive behavioural interventions, including structured interventions involving healthy diet and physical activity, may be offered to adults living with obesity prescribed GLP-1 therapies. This is based on low-certainty evidence suggesting it may enhance treatment outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Medication alone won’t reverse the obesity challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While GLP-1 therapies represent the first efficacious treatment option for adults with obesity, the WHO guideline emphasizes that medicines alone will not solve the problem. Obesity is not only an individual concern but also a societal challenge that requires multisectoral action. Addressing obesity requires a fundamental reorientation of current approaches to a comprehensive strategy built with three pillars:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creating healthier environments through robust population-level policies to promote health and prevent obesity;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protecting individuals at high risk of developing obesity and related comorbidities through targeted screening and structured early interventions; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensuring access to lifelong, person-centred care.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementation considerations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guideline emphasizes the importance of fair access to GLP-1 therapies and preparing health systems for use of these medicines. Without deliberate policies, access to these therapies could exacerbate existing health disparities. WHO calls for urgent action on manufacturing, affordability, and system readiness to meet global needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with rapid expansion in production, GLP-1 therapies are projected to reach fewer than 10% of those who could benefit by 2030. The guideline calls on the global community to consider strategies to expand access, such as pooled procurement, tiered pricing, and voluntary licensing among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHO action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO developed the guideline in response to requests from its Member States looking to address the challenges posed by obesity. The process to develop the guideline involved extensive analysis of available evidence, and consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including people with lived experience. This guideline is a key deliverable under the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/newsroom/feature-stories/item/turning-the-tide-with-who-s-plan-to-stop-obesity" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;WHO acceleration plan to stop obesity&lt;/a&gt; and will be updated regularly as new evidence emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During 2026, WHO will work closely with relevant stakeholders to encourage development of a transparent and equitable prioritization framework to ensure those with the highest need are reached first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About GLP-1 therapies for obesity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHO defines obesity as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher in adults. GLP-1 receptor agonists are a class of medicines that help lower blood sugar, support weight loss, reduce the risk of heart and kidney complications, and can even lower the risk of early death in people with type 2 diabetes. This guideline provides recommendations specifically for three agents used in the long-term treatment of obesity in adults: liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Falsified and substandard medical products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The global demand for GLP-1 therapies has fueled the spread of falsified and substandard products, threatening patient safety and trust. Ensuring quality requires regulated distribution and prescription by a qualified health care providers, strong oversight, patient education, and global cooperation to protect public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium is essential for many bodily processes, and not getting enough of it can negatively impact your health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People may take magnesium supplements for blood pressure, anxiety, and migraine prevention, but it isn't a guaranteed way to treat any health conditions or worrisome symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Before taking a magnesium supplement, you should talk to a healthcare provider to make sure it’s the best option for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium has recently been touted as a potential treatment for a wide range of health issues, from high blood pressure to migraine to anxiety. While it is an essential mineral, it can interact with certain medications, and you should check with a healthcare provider before starting a supplement.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
“Supplements can be helpful, although it’s best to review with a provider first,” &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zumpano-julia-4757482a/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Julia Zumpano, RD&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian at Cleveland Clinic, told Verywell. She notes:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; Some studies have shown that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/the-surprising-ways-magnesium-helps-to-lower-blood-pressure-8759666" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplementation can modestly reduce blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, but more research is needed to confirm the benefit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety and depression:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium may also reduce &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/anxiety-attack-5088600" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;symptoms of anxiety&lt;/a&gt; by balancing levels of cortisol, a hormone that affects your stress levels, Zumpano added. Preliminary research also suggests magnesium may help people with mild depression.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migraine prevention:&lt;/strong&gt; Some users on TikTok also claim that daily &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/magnesium-for-migraines-11834187" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;magnesium supplements can help prevent migrain&lt;/a&gt;e, but research on this connection is inconclusive. “Some studies show benefit, and some do not,” Zumpano said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical performance:&lt;/strong&gt; While animal studies have suggested magnesium may impact physical performance—by boosting glucose availability in the brain, muscle, and blood—there’s not enough evidence to show the same benefit in humans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-happens-when-you-have-low-magnesium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Happens When You Have Low Magnesium? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people don’t get enough magnesium, partly because so much of the food we eat is processed, said &lt;a href="https://www.memphis.edu/healthsciences/about/faculty/marievandermerwe.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Marie van der Merwe, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, coordinator of the applied physiology and nutrition doctoral program at the University of Memphis College of Health Sciences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/low-magnesium-11764364" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low on magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, you may start feeling less than your best. “Having lower magnesium creates a negative feedback loop” in the body, van der Merwe said. "It’s like a domino effect,” she added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium deficiency might be seen in people under a lot of stress, van der Merwe explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Typically magnesium is inside your cells, but what happens when you’re under stress is the magnesium moves from inside the cell to outside the cell in your bloodstream, and it’s very easy to get excreted through your kidneys,” causing you to be low on magnesium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When this happens, you may notice symptoms like headache or muscle spasms caused by your magnesium levels. This can make your stress even worse and create a vicious cycle.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women need 310 to 320 milligrams (mg) of magnesium a day, while men need 400 to 420 mg.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For reference:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;1 ounce of dry roasted almonds contains 80 mg of magnesium&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1/2 cup of boiled spinach contains 78 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons of smooth peanut butter contain 49 mg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re experiencing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/low-magnesium-symptoms-7968593" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;symptoms of low magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, you should try to increase your magnesium through food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I approach nutrition with a ‘food first’ mentality, in that we should get as many nutrients as possible from our foods before adding in supplements as needed,” Core said. “The nutrients in foods are easier for our bodies to use and absorb, as opposed to their elemental form in supplements.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts say that &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/best-magnesium-supplements-8579258" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium supplements&lt;/a&gt; shouldn’t be used as a cure-all in place of healthy lifestyle habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Before you try a supplement, you can try to manage your stress level, prioritize sleep and exercise, and reduce intake of alcohol, caffeine, and processed foods, Zumpano said.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you have covered all these bases but are still experiencing concerning [symptoms], that is where supplements can help,” Zumpano added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re dealing with anxiety, high blood pressure, or migraine, a healthcare provider may suggest medication in addition to—or in place of—supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “While proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle are key for preventing a myriad of conditions, you may require medication as a treatment,” Core said. “Supplements can help to improve health, but are not meant to cure any conditions.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, it’s worth talking to a provider before making any changes, no matter how harmless they seem. “Always discuss your concerns with your doctor,” Core said.

It's easy to think that medicine, science, and modern living have made us "perfect" or immune to natural selection. It's a widespread belief that once we established civilization, eliminated certain diseases, and extended our life spans, we reached the peak of evolution. But anthropologists and geneticists strongly disagree. &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/humans-still-evolving-science-research/" target="_blank"&gt;Evolution never stopped&lt;/a&gt;; it simply shifted its direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although modern medicine allows fewer people to die before reproducing, natural selection still acts on our genes. In fact, some scientists believe modern living has accelerated our evolution. A faster lifestyle leads to faster changes and even faster adaptations. Homo sapiens is far from being a finished stage of human development. What once shaped us in the wild now comes through sanitation, diet, and social structures. But the story is far from over. All we have to do is take a glance at our genomes and see the footprints of an ongoing evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-2b6c1502-7fff-1f85-58e0-aea2ee14c79d"&gt;Evolution is the change in the genetic makeup of a population over generations. Pressures, such as environmental changes, infectious diseases, food availability, predators, and competition for resources, are the primary drivers for these changes. The individuals that fail to adapt don't procreate, thus their genes aren't passed on. That's how natural selection works. In the past, this evolutionary pressure was intense and consistent. Our &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/an-entirely-new-form-of-ancient-human-may-have-been-discovered/" target="_blank"&gt;ancient human ancestors&lt;/a&gt; carried genes that helped them adapt to different climates, resist pathogens, and process foods that were not part of their typical diet (think lactose tolerance). Today's humans carry the signature of those past adaptations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-2b6c1502-7fff-1f85-58e0-aea2ee14c79d"&gt;Modern anthropology teaches us that evolution didn't stop once humans developed agriculture, culture, or cities. In fact, the process of evolution is ongoing. However, its shape has changed. Although modern medicine, technology, and our cultural practices have eliminated the need for certain survival traits we developed in the past, new sources of selective pressure have appeared. Genetic studies show that allele (versions of genes) frequencies continue to change. This is hard proof of an ongoing evolution. Our environment is constantly changing due to climate, culture, diseases, and dietary preferences. Humans still have to adapt to these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In short, our species remains a "work in progress." However, we must understand that the drive behind evolution somewhat changed. It's no longer the wild landscape of survival-based selection that forces evolution forward. It's the modern world we have built.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-c5de611e-7fff-7743-499d-7268ff9df0ea"&gt;The first agricultural settlements had a pivotal influence on changes in our diet, social structures, and disease resistance, but anthropologists argue that city living imposed new selective pressures, and human genomes responded to them. For instance, genetic studies of ancient city dwellers show that populations with a long history of urban settlement show a higher frequency of a particular variant of the SLC11A1 gene. This gene helps resist pathogens such as tuberculosis or leprosy. That means that tightly packed, dense human settlements shaped the human immune system in ways that rural settlements couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The influence of cities on human evolution isn't limited to the disease ecology. Cities fragment the population and restrict the flow of genes, but at the same time, it accelerates genetic drift. In other words, city population has a tendency to grow fast, but from a very restricted genetic pool. The result is a constant shift of genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Although modern life reduces the old challenges that used to drive evolution, it also creates new challenges. Clean water, hygiene, reliable food, and medical care protect us from many dangers humans once had to face, but new pressures, such as air pollution, chronic stress, and densely packed living conditions, are now pushing human evolution in new directions. Evolution in cities is not always straightforward. It can be unpredictable due to high migration rates and different cultural habits we develop. Who knows &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/this-is-what-humans-might-evolve-to-look-like-in-the-year-3000/" target="_blank"&gt;what humans will look like in 1000 years&lt;/a&gt;. Modern life is not simply a backdrop on which evolution unfolds. It's an active agent that shapes us in subtle but real ways.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;On Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel like every time I write about ultraprocessed foods, I say something like “It’s a hot topic.” Well, that’s still true. And a few weeks ago, the scientific journal The Lancet took on the issue in a big way, with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/series-do/ultra-processed-food" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;a three-part series&lt;/a&gt; of articles looking at what we know about the impact of ultraprocessed foods on human health based on the available evidence, as well as broader-scale systemic issues that drive people to eat these foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have always been several points that concerned me about the UPF debate, and I think The Lancet has largely addressed them. One key point is the gaps in the research on UPFs and health. Ideally, when assessing whether doing or not doing something affects health, researchers do a randomized controlled trial to find proof, but that’s challenging to do when you’re studying eating patterns and health. That’s why so much nutrition research is epidemiological, or “observational,” which looks for &lt;em&gt;associations&lt;/em&gt; between diet and health outcomes over a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, associations can’t prove cause-and-effect. However, there is a set of criteria used to infer causality from observational studies, and the Lancet report says the existing evidence — including consistent results from large, high-quality observational studies and from short-term randomized controlled trials — meets most of those criteria. That accumulated evidence, the authors write, “supports the thesis that the displacement of long-established dietary patterns by UPFs is a key driver of the escalating global burden of multiple diet-related chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational research has found that diets with higher percentages of UPFs are also higher in calories, total fat, saturated fat and added sugar — all of which, in excess, have been linked to chronic disease — as well as several toxic compounds, including endocrine disruptor chemicals that may leach from packaging. High-UPF diets are also lower in health-protective nutrients such as fiber, protein, potassium, zinc, magnesium, several vitamins and phytochemicals. This appears to be largely because UPFs displace the primary food sources of those nutrients, such as fruits, vegetables and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I’m not in favor of demonizing individual foods, it’s hard to argue that a diet high in UPFs, which can support life, also supports health. Do we need overstuffed snack food aisles? Do we need nearly 20 flavors of a certain chip with a name that starts with “D” and ends with “itos”? Of course, not all UPFs are snack foods, and the reality is that not everyone has access to fresh foods, the money to buy those fresh foods, or the time or energy or equipment or knowledge to cook fresh foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want our fellow humans to eat better, then we can’t hold them to unrealistic expectations — we need to meet them where they’re at. So when outspoken &lt;a href="https://www.jessicawilsonmsrd.com/makingitawkward" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;doctors and researchers&lt;/a&gt; say that starving is better than eating “bad food” and that soda, Cheetos and baby formula have the same impacts on the body as crack cocaine, they’re showing the elitist and out-of-touch side of the UPF debate that will never help anybody be healthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the loudest anti-UPF voices think we should just ban them outright. The Lancet report acknowledges in a more nuanced way that getting to a place where an estimated average of more than 50% of the human diet is UPFs is a systemic problem, not a personal problem. The report notes that our collective increased consumption of UPFs is driven by both supply and demand — we want food that’s convenient, affordable and palatable, and companies have supplied that food, then made it easy and enticing to buy more, because that’s what businesses do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This is why I am in favor of restrictions on marketing UPFs to children, because like it or not, we are influenced by marketing and advertising — companies wouldn’t spend so much money on it if it didn’t work — and children are more easily influenced.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the authors call for policies that reduce the production and availability of UPFs — including curtailing the political power wielded by the global food conglomerates that produce and profit from these foods the most — they also call for policies that increase the availability, affordability and appeal of fresh and minimally processed foods without creating more burden for those who have limited time or money. They point to a notable gap that remains in the availability of healthy, timesaving, ready-to-eat and ready-to-heat meals, but it’s this statement from &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01566-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Part 2 of the report&lt;/a&gt; that I want to frame:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ensuring equitable access to affordable, nutritious, and convenient foods requires confronting entrenched socioeconomic, gender, and racial inequalities that restrict people’s access to income, housing, time, cooking facilities, and food preparation skills. Reducing reliance on UPFs demands a cultural shift: valuing domestic cooking, redistributing food-related responsibilities — particularly from women to men — and challenging entrenched gender roles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always shaken my head at the cluelessness, however well-intentioned, of statements like, “There’s no reason to buy cheap processed food when it’s inexpensive to buy dry beans and cook them from scratch.” While beans are good food, and both inexpensive and nutritious, they aren’t a universal solution. There’s money poverty, but also time poverty. Also, someone may not have access to a stove or slow cooker, they may not like beans, they may not to be able to comfortably eat beans (hello, IBS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One final point, and one The Lancet did not address: I’ve watched the discourse on UPFs lead to anxiety and rigidity around these foods, with some people turning “I never eat ultraprocessed foods” into an identity, and sometimes into an eating disorder. If this sounds like you, please know that reducing UPFs isn’t the same as eradicating them, and you don’t need to eat perfectly to be a “healthy” eater.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This decision comes on the heels of recent federal funding cuts that threaten to disrupt hard-earned progress combatting this global epidemic. Despite significant scientific advancements in HIV treatment and prevention, many people worry about our efforts to end this ongoing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1988, Dec. 1 has been recognized as World AIDS Day by communities throughout the world. It is a day to remember the people who have died of HIV/AIDS, demonstrate our continued support for people living with HIV and strengthen the global efforts to end this epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. presidents have recognized the day in various ways. Seventeen years ago, &lt;a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081201.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081201.html" aria-label="President George W. Bush"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081201.html"&gt;President George W. Bush&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; discussed the unparalleled success of his signature initiative, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. He also noted that the red ribbon displayed at the White House was, “a symbol of our resolve to confront HIV/AIDS and to affirm the matchless value of every life.” Just a year ago, &lt;a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/" aria-label="President Joe Biden"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/12/01/a-proclamation-on-world-aids-day-2024/"&gt;President Joe Biden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remarked that, “we renew our commitment to accelerating efforts to finally end the HIV/AIDS epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the &lt;a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743" aria-label="U.S. State Department"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://substack.com/home/post/p-179940743"&gt;U.S. State Department&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sent an email to employees that stated, “The U.S. Government will not be commemorating World AIDS Day this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;HIV/AIDS Funding Cuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;One could argue that a day of commemoration does not save lives. But funding does. And the HIV/AIDS funding landscape has changed dramatically during the Trump administration. Winnie Byanyima, executive director of &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437" aria-label="UNAIDS"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-114186437"&gt;UNAIDS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, noted in a recently released report that, “this year’s disruption to the global response has exposed the fragility of the progress we have fought so hard to achieve.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The numbers are stark. According to the UNAIDS report, 60% of women-led HIV organizations have been significantly affected by recent funding disruptions. The number of people accessing pre-exposure prophylaxis has dropped in many countries. NGOs in the U.S. and globally have scaled back their services because of a loss of funding. The result? The number of new HIV infections per year could rise after &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" aria-label="several years of declines"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet"&gt;several years of declines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="subhead-embed"&gt;Current HIV/AIDS Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Today, about 40 million people worldwide are living with HIV. Roughly 1.3 million people became newly infected in 2024 and over 600,000 people died. In the United States, about 1.2 million people are living with HIV. And roughly 32,000 people become newly infected each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Globally and domestically, the number of new infections per year has dropped in recent years. In the U.S., for example, the number of new infections declined 12% between 2018 and 2022. Recent advancements in HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention certainly have contributed to these declines. The long-acting injectable lenacapavir, for example, is a highly effective pre-exposure prophylaxis drug. Just two injections per year can provide nearly complete protection from the sexual transmission of HIV. For people infected with HIV, various drug regimens can effectively reduce one’s viral load to undetectable levels. And we know that U = U. If your viral load is undetectable, then you cannot transmit the virus sexually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MWrh7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;But the gains that we have made in recent years easily can be lost. Stigma, discrimination, and inequalities prevent people from accessing services. Decreased funding will negatively impact the availability of HIV/AIDS services. Now is not the time to relax our efforts to ending the HIV epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;World AIDS Day may not directly save lives. But it is an opportunity for us to remember the gravity of the problem. As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U" aria-label="Beatriz Grinsztejn"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pInv-c2Ub8U"&gt;Beatriz Grinsztejn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, president of the International AIDS Society, recently remarked, “On this World AIDS Day, let us honor the strength of communities, the power of science and the courage of everyone working with, living with or affected by HIV.” On this World AIDS Day, the U.S. declines to participate. Let’s hope this decision does not contribute to a resurgence of HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Forbes</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 13:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOeUtYSDVpbEZ1alFiVk04NzhBNmlMZ0ZUdEo5eG84MHgwcE5McnQ2ckRNeTFodzRaQ2ZuRk9rOFotV09hOTdoTDdhSVlWdlhsUHhBZGNuY0Y3UHFtcmNMN3BnX3QxVDlERXg5ZWVhQmlRTFJPM0ZvUGtHaXdzTEUtclA4ak9rYUkwT1BjeWluSTkzNkw2Y3JLYjRiQTdIUWl0Z2lUS1FwcjNUZw</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织推荐GLP-1药物治疗肥胖症- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/recommends-glp-1-drugs-obesity-rcna245919</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1adfc5" class="body-graf"&gt;The World Health Organization on Monday recommended GLP-1 drugs as a tool to manage obesity in adults, marking a shift in the way the U.N. agency has historically framed obesity treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70f12" class="body-graf"&gt;The WHO said that GLP-1 drugs can be part of a long-term treatment strategy that combines medication with counseling on healthy diets and physical activity.

&lt;p&gt;Some hunters in California made a seriously weird discovery: several wild pigs had &lt;strong&gt;neon blue fat&lt;/strong&gt; under their skin. Reported by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the strange find has sparked public warnings and raised real concerns about toxic contamination in the area. The&lt;strong&gt; bright blue color &lt;/strong&gt;wasn’t caused by a lighting trick or a rare mutation. The unusual hue appeared &lt;strong&gt;only in the pigs’ fat&lt;/strong&gt;, while the rest of the meat looked completely normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Poisoned Fat, Hidden Risks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pigs were found in Monterey County by local trapper &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan Burton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who’s been dealing with wildlife for years—but even he had never seen anything like this. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not talking about a little blue,” he told &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-05/exposure-to-rat-poison-turns-meat-of-wild-pigs-blue-authorities-in-monterey-county-warn" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “I’m talking about neon blue, blueberry blue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After some digging, state officials figured out that the bright blue came from &lt;strong&gt;diphacinone&lt;/strong&gt;, a rodent poison that’s often dyed for easy ID. As stated by the&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://wildlife.ca.gov/News/Archive/poison-detection-in-wild-pigs-brings-attention-to-pesticide-exposure-in-hunter-harvested-wildlife" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this chemical works by stopping blood from clotting, which causes animals to bleed internally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It breaks down faster than newer rodenticides, but it can still hang around in an animal’s tissues, long enough to be dangerous to predators and even people who&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/when-humans-started-eating-meat/" data-type="post" data-id="81593"&gt; eat the meat&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-bourbour-b08491b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ryan Bourbour&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pesticide investigator at the CDFW: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hunters should be aware that the meat of game animals, such as wild pig, deer, bear and geese, might be contaminated if that game animal has been exposed to rodenticides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When Local Wildlife Pays the Price&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diphacinone&lt;/strong&gt; is commonly used in farming to control rodent problems, but even with new rules rolled out in 2024, it’s still hard to keep the poison from reaching animals it wasn’t meant for. Over time, traces of the chemical have shown up in &lt;strong&gt;mountain lions, bobcats, foxes&lt;/strong&gt;, and even endangered species like the &lt;strong&gt;San Joaquin kit fox&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;northern spotted owl&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Predators often get exposed without even touching the bait—just by eating prey that already has the poison in its system. And even when it’s used properly, the effects can &lt;strong&gt;spread through entire food chains&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wildlife experts have raised red flags for years about the long-term risks. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/wild-pigs-turned-neon-blue-in-california-triggering-warnings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Science Alert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports that animals poisoned by diphacinone frequently show no obvious signs until it’s too late, unless someone catches it early and gives them &lt;strong&gt;vitamin K&lt;/strong&gt; as treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pushing for Safer Pest Control Methods&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calls for alternative pest control strategies have intensified in light of these events. As noted in the same source, integrated pest management, an approach that reduces reliance on chemicals, has been proposed as a more sustainable solution. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes the use of&lt;strong&gt; physical barriers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;traps&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;strong&gt; natural deterrents&lt;/strong&gt; like essential oils or predatory species. CDFW has urged pesticide applicators to &lt;strong&gt;take&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;extra precautions&lt;/strong&gt; before setting rodenticides in areas frequented by wildlife. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is important to ensure non-target wildlife are not using the area where the pesticide is to be applied,” &lt;/em&gt;the department advises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proper bait stations and careful application can minimize exposure, but enforcement and awareness remain inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do people get headaches? – Evie V., age 10, Corpus Christi, Texas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether sharp and stabbing or dull and throbbing, a headache can ruin your day. But your &lt;a href="https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/m/s2/chapter06.html"&gt;brain doesn’t actually feel pain&lt;/a&gt;. So what is going on when it feels like your head is in a vise or about to explode?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pediatrics.pitt.edu/people/katherine-cobb-pitstick"&gt;I am a child neurologist&lt;/a&gt; – that is, a doctor who specializes in diseases of the brain in kids. Most of my patients are kids and adolescents who are struggling with headaches.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00034.2015"&gt;Head pain&lt;/a&gt; is complicated, and there is still a lot to learn about what causes it and how it can be treated. But researchers know there are a few key players that take part in generating pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are headaches?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nerves &lt;a href="https://openbooks.lib.msu.edu/introneuroscience1/chapter/pain/"&gt;communicate information like pain&lt;/a&gt; through electrical signals between the body and the brain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the brain itself doesn’t have any nerve sensors to feel pain, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-823356-6.00001-9"&gt;blood vessels in the head and structures&lt;/a&gt; that protect and surround the brain do sense pain. When these tissues detect injury or damage, they release chemicals that trigger transmission of electrical signals through nerves to tell the brain the head is hurting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain will also use nerves to signal the body to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-024-01914-z"&gt;respond to pain with symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like feeling tired, teary eyes, runny nose, upset stomach and discomfort in bright or loud environments. It’s not clear &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1468-2982.2002.00437.x"&gt;why humans evolved to feel these symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, but some scientists theorize that this can lead to healthier lifestyle choices to decrease the chance of future headache attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Weather changes are one of the most commonly reported migraine triggers.  Danielle Wilhour, a neurologist and headache specialist at University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, explains why shifts in weather can bring on migraines — and what you can do to ease the pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What causes headaches?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, headaches are a sign that the body is under some kind of stress. That stress triggers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14786"&gt;chemical and physical changes&lt;/a&gt; to the nerves and blood vessels around your brain, head and neck that can cause headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/top-10-migraine-triggers/"&gt;Many types of stresses can cause headaches&lt;/a&gt;, including an infection, allergies, hormone changes during puberty and menstrual cycles, not getting enough sleep, not drinking enough water, skipping meals or drinking too much caffeine or alcohol. Sometimes, headaches happen with emotional stress, like feeling anxious or depressed. Even &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/barometric-pressure-headache"&gt;pressure in your sinuses&lt;/a&gt; due to changes in the weather can cause your head to hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11916-013-0341-z"&gt;One in 11 kids&lt;/a&gt; have had a type of severe headache called a migraine. They feel like a pulsing and pounding pain in your head and come with other symptoms, including nausea or being sensitive to lights and sounds. During a migraine, it can be hard to do everyday activities because they can make the pain worse. It is also very common to feel unwell or irritable &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40265-018-0865-y"&gt;before the head pain starts&lt;/a&gt; and after the pain is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/702985/original/file-20251117-62-ml4kpw.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Migraines and chronic headaches can be debilitating.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/frustrated-depressed-millennial-girl-lying-in-royalty-free-image/1778015136"&gt;Viktoriya Skorikova/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migraines occur when the nerves and other structures used in signaling and interpreting pain aren’t working properly, leading to pain and discomfort from stimulation that wouldn’t normally provoke this. There are many &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111557"&gt;environmental and genetic&lt;/a&gt; factors that contribute to this dysfunction. Some people are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S282562"&gt;born with a higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing migraines. Most people with migraines have someone in their family who also experiences them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What can treat and prevent headaches?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying what type of headache you’re experiencing is crucial to making sure it is treated properly. Because migraines can be severe, they’re the type of headache that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000001414"&gt;most often leads to doctor’s visits&lt;/a&gt; for both kids and adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to &lt;a href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/lifestyle-changes-for-migraine/"&gt;reduce your chances of having headaches&lt;/a&gt;, such as drinking plenty of water and limiting caffeine. Eating, sleeping and exercising regularly are other ways you can help prevent headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/702990/original/file-20251117-84-ee27nr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Sleep deprivation can worsen headaches.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/tired-teenager-resting-on-a-pile-of-books-royalty-free-image/866310120"&gt;DjelicS/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While painkillers like ibuprofen are often enough to relieve a headache, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/con.0000000000001414"&gt;prescription medications are sometimes necessary&lt;/a&gt; to make head pain more bearable. Some medications can also help control or prevent headache episodes. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-024-03833-7"&gt;Physical therapy&lt;/a&gt; to exercise the body or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14914"&gt;behavioral therapy&lt;/a&gt; to work on the mind can also help you manage headache pain. There are even &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/life14020173"&gt;electronic devices&lt;/a&gt; to treat headaches by stimulating different parts of the nervous system.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to talk with a doctor about headaches, especially if it’s a new problem or you experience a change in how they usually feel. Sometimes, brain imaging or blood tests are needed to rule out another health issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing a headache problem early will help your doctor get started on helping you figure out the best way to treat it.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a death sentence then but now you can live long and well with HIV so that it doesn’t develop into Aids. With treatment, your viral load can be undetectable so you can’t pass it on to another person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“If you continue to take medication, you will not transmit because it wont be detected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“There shouldn’t be any fear attached to having a diagnosis in this day and age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Annabel Overton, a midwife, added: “It’s important that people know that because that could be part of the barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Speaking to the rise of false information online, Ms Moore said: “I want people to rise above the misinformation and seek advice from reputable sources such as ourselves. Don’t use social media to get your information because a lot of that is personal opinion rather than evidence-based research. That will hinder the progress towards 2030 and beyond where we might see the elimination of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“Fear is driving a lot of the stigma. Because HIV is lifestyle linked, people may misconstrue how you caught HIV. You don’t have to be promiscuous to catch it, it can be the one and only time that you have sex that you pick that up. We are all at risk of getting HIV if we indulge in sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said that within the island’s small population, fears persist about lack of confidentiality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“People don’t need to worry about confidentiality when they come here. Information is kept safe and secure,” Ms Overton insisted. “What comes into these four walls, stays in these four walls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore said it was also important to raise awareness of treatment and support services including the Sexual Reproductive Health at the Department of Health where she works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;She said: “We have free services that include healthcare, emotional support and access to life-saving treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We have in-house social workers, we work closely with the infection specialist as well as the Mid Atlantic Wellness Institute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Overton said: “Testing is free at the clinic whether you are insured, uninsured or underinsured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore added: “Treatment is funded so that you will be able to get your medication at very little cost to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids, and from a mother to her baby. It can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy where as untreated HIV can progress to Aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore said Bermuda was fortunate to have eliminated mother-to-child transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Overton explained: “We screen very regularly during pregnancy, at the beginning, in the middle and towards the end as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore added: “So if it is detected, the mother can be treated and it can prevent that transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Ms Moore and Ms Overton said that the facility it is working with LGBTQ+ support and advocacy charity &lt;a href="https://outbermuda.org/" id="link-1d25ee535fe0066dd9ee8e1912bceca4" target="_blank"&gt;OutBermuda&lt;/a&gt; as well as with HIV/Aids charity &lt;a href="https://helpingservices.bm/listing/star-supportive-therapy-for-persons-with-aids-and-their-families/" id="link-5082f6c99308f791532fb5c6f75da4dc" target="_blank"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;“We work through schools, health fairs, pop-ups events, Sexual Health Awareness Week and other events throughout the year to ensure everyone has the information they need,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox desktop hidden"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Health awareness events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-00d89de499c3b7452add720ba9ca8c2a"&gt;December 1:&lt;/strong&gt; World Aids Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-12d9f5a7fe9944d7a8c05c15276168cd"&gt;Mid-February:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual Health Awareness Week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-36a1cf30f9749117646d9b028c9092ea"&gt;April 7:&lt;/strong&gt; World Health Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-a44eb03af3ca1302e27828cb82b4b959"&gt;June:&lt;/strong&gt; HIV Pop-Up Testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox-mobile d-lg-none"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Health awareness events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-00d89de499c3b7452add720ba9ca8c2a"&gt;December 1:&lt;/strong&gt; World Aids Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-12d9f5a7fe9944d7a8c05c15276168cd"&gt;Mid-February:&lt;/strong&gt; Sexual Health Awareness Week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-36a1cf30f9749117646d9b028c9092ea"&gt;April 7:&lt;/strong&gt; World Health Day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;&lt;strong id="strong-a44eb03af3ca1302e27828cb82b4b959"&gt;June:&lt;/strong&gt; HIV Pop-Up Testing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;A report published at the end of 2022 contains information received by the Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit from 1982 through to January 31, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;It showed that as of December 31, 2022, it was estimated that there were 295 persons known to be living with HIV in Bermuda, giving an overall prevalence of 0.5 per cent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-factbox desktop hidden"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Report’s findings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="text"&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Since 1982, HIV has been diagnosed in 792 persons in Bermuda. Of these, 606 persons have had a diagnosis of Aids and 497 have died either from or with HIV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;As of December 31, 2022, it is estimated that there are 295 persons known to be living with HIV in Bermuda, giving an overall prevalence of 0.5 per cent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;HIV incidence peaked from 1984 to 1987 followed by a steady decline over the next 15 years. There was then an increase in persons diagnosed from 2005 to 2008. This increase may be partly due to improved awareness of the availability of testing. Since then there has been a general decline with less than ten new HIV diagnoses reported per year from 2011 to 2022. There were two new HIV diagnoses reported in 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body"&gt;Aids incidence peaked in 1995 with 49 persons reported with HIV diagnoses in that year. This has declined since then with ten or fewer persons reported with an Aids diagnosis annually since 2004.

Despite dealing with an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation and muscle weakness, she has steadily rebuilt her strength. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a conversation with Nutrition coach Ryan Fernando, Samantha shared how weight training changed her life. In the podcast she shared her workouts 5 to 6 days a week and mornings are her personal favorite, as it “sets up the mood for the day”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On social media, Samantha’s fitness routine doesn’t give off the image of an easy journey.

			&lt;p&gt;A recent study points to a key bone-strengthening mechanism at work in the body, which could be targeted to treat the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968"&gt;bone-weakening disease, osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by researchers from the University of Leipzig in Germany and Shandong University in China, the study identified the cell receptor GPR133 (also known as ADGRD1) as being crucial to bone density, via bone-building cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast"&gt;called osteoblasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Variations in the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene had previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108145"&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to bone density, leading scientists to turn their attention to the protein it encoded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-deep-inside-human-bones-scientists-warn"&gt;Microplastics Found Deep Inside Human Bones, Scientists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team ran tests on mice in which the gene was either absent or could be activated using a chemical called AP503.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of the &lt;em&gt;GPR133&lt;/em&gt; gene, the mice grew up with weak bones, resembling the symptoms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/osteoporosis-is-a-silent-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;of osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;. However, when the receptor was present and activated by AP503, bone production and strength improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Using the substance AP503, which was only recently identified via a computer-assisted screen as a stimulator of GPR133, we were able to significantly increase bone strength in both healthy and osteoporotic mice," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; University of Leipzig biochemist Ines Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, AP503 serves as a biological button that gets the osteoblasts working harder. The researchers were also able to show that it could work in tandem &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-can-provide-relief-for-backpain-if-you-do-it-safely"&gt;with exercise&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen bones even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the GPR133 cell receptor is a crucial link in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/green-spaces-may-have-a-powerful-effect-on-the-bones-of-children"&gt;keeping mice bones strong&lt;/a&gt; is an important finding. While the results are based on an animal model, the underlying processes are likely similar in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this receptor is impaired by genetic changes, mice show signs of loss of bone density at an early age – similar to osteoporosis in humans," &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Liebscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg" alt="Bone diagram" class="wp-image-174316 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-633x415.jpg 633w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/BoneDiagram-600x393.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174316" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;With GPR133 activated (on the left), the osteoblasts (orange) are more dominant.

While available treatments can &lt;a href="https://theros.org.uk/information-and-support/osteoporosis/treatment/"&gt;slow the condition's progress&lt;/a&gt;, there's no way to reverse or cure the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments also tend to come with risky side effects (like an increased risk of other diseases) or become less effective over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are actually &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-hormone-that-makes-super-strong-bones"&gt;numerous factors&lt;/a&gt; that have an influence on bone strength, and that gives scientists plenty of scope for finding methods &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-bones-could-soon-heal-a-whole-lot-better-thanks-to-polymer-nanoshells"&gt;that ward off&lt;/a&gt; issues like osteoporosis and promote a healthier old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/living-material-made-from-blood-can-repair-bones-study-shows"&gt;In 2024, scientists developed a blood-based implant&lt;/a&gt; that supercharges this mechanism for bigger repair projects: broken bones. When skin tissue is wounded, our blood &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-synthetic-blood-clotting-system-could-help-stop-internal-bleeding"&gt;starts clotting&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/how-wounds-hea"&gt;the healing process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international team of researchers behind the implant called it a "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202407156"&gt;biocooperative regenerative&lt;/a&gt;" material: it uses synthetic peptides to improve the structure and function of the barrier naturally formed by blood when it clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests on rats, the gel-like substance – which can be 3D-printed – was effective in repairing bone damage.

The global burden is rising, and CVDs resulted in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;19.8 million deaths globally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in 2022, as per the WHO. Placing heart health should be the topmost priority today. In a newsletter, Dr Jeremy London, a board-certified cardiovascular surgeon trained at the Joseph Hospital in Denver and Carolinas Medical Center, NC, talks about the common traits found in heart surgery patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Common traits found in heart surgery patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The surgeon, who has over 25 years of clinical experience, revealed that these common traits are often the driving force behind heart diseases in those who require heart surgery. He also explained why focusing on the modifiable factors is important. “The harsh truth is that surgery resolves the acute problem but does not address the underlying chronic problem. Behaviour modifications are the most effective treatment of the why or the root cause,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What are these traits? Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smoking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smoking is the worst thing to do to your body, especially the heart, according to Dr London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smoking damages the lining of your blood vessels, which has been directly shown to lead to atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in your arteries). This hardens and narrows your blood vessels, restricting blood flow to your heart and other organs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “In addition, the carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke binds to haemoglobin in the blood more readily than oxygen, reducing the amount of oxygen that reaches the heart and the rest of your body.” You don't have to be a chain-smoker to damage your heart. Even occasional smoking can lead to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A recent study published in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004561" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;even low-intensity smokers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have a substantially higher risk of heart disease and death compared to people who never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The good news is the solution is simple: stop smoking,” the doctor advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Obesity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second trait that most heart surgery patients share is obesity. “I have seen the rise of obesity firsthand. With fast food and processed foods increasing in popularity, obesity has become the silent killer,” the doctor said. He explained how obesity leads to high blood pressure and chronic inflammation that damages the blood vessels, resulting in atherosclerosis and elevating heart disease risk. A 2024 study by the American Heart Association found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/obesity-related-heart-disease-deaths-increased-in-the-u-s-over-the-past-two-decades?preview=cd9c&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;obesity-related heart disease deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; increased by 180% in the US between 1999 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr London noted that type 2 diabetes could also lead to severe heart disease that requires surgery. “Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle-induced disease. That means it will take lifestyle changes to reverse it,” he said. Simple changes such as weight loss, eating a healthy diet and physical activity can reverse the condition. Another study by the American Heart Association in 2023 found that one in three adults with type 2 diabetes may have &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/1-in-3-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-may-have-undetected-cardiovascular-disease?preview=cd9c&amp;amp;preview_mode=True" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;undetected cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genetics&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fourth factor that increases the risk of heart disease is your genetics. “You can't run from your genes. However, you do have power over how they are expressed,” the cardiologist said. Yes, you read that right. You can still control how your genes express by making three simple changes in your lifestyle: diet, exercise and stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The key is not to eat healthily once, go to the gym once or get a good night's rest once. Those are small victories. The key is to build a routine where, if you miss those things, you crave them,” the doctor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If these are some of the traits you observe in your life, this is your sign to make changes. Just as Dr London emphasised, focus on the lifestyle factors you can improve to keep your heart healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

The condition, that stems from the gradual breakdown of cartilage at the ends of bones, eventually causes swelling, stiffness, and persistent discomfort. While it can affect any joint, knee osteoarthritis is particularly widespread, studies show that nearly 30% of adults over 45 display signs of it on x-rays, and almost half of them go on to face daily pain or movement challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has remained unclear is which type of exercise offers the most reliable relief. Although movement is considered essential in osteoarthritis care, treatment guidelines often stop short of naming one approach as the most effective. To resolve that gap, researchers conducted an extensive analysis comparing different forms of exercise used by people with knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to Choose the Right Diet for Arthritis Management&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/391/bmj-2025-085242" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, point strongly toward aerobic activity. After reviewing 217 randomized clinical trials conducted between 1990 and 2024, involving 15,684 participants, the researchers concluded that exercises such as walking, cycling, and swimming consistently outperformed other methods in easing pain, improving function, and enhancing overall quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared aerobic routines with flexibility training, strengthening work, mind-body exercises, neuromotor programs, and mixed approaches, using control groups as a baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team evaluated outcomes through the internationally recognized GRADE system, examining pain reduction, physical function, gait performance, and quality of life at four-week, 12-week, and 24-week intervals. Across nearly every measure and timeframe, aerobic exercise ranked at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate-certainty evidence showed that aerobic activity reduced short, and mid-term pain, improved physical function in the short and long term, and boosted both gait performance and quality of life in the early and mid stages. Other exercise styles had their strengths, mind-body workouts appeared to support short-term function, neuromotor exercises improved short-term gait, and strengthening or mixed routines offered mid-term functional gains, but none matched the broader and more consistent benefits of aerobic movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety was also a priority in the analysis, and the researchers noted that none of the exercise categories caused more adverse events than the control groups. At the same time, they acknowledged limitations such as reliance on indirect comparisons, limited long-term data for certain outcomes, and the influence smaller studies may have had on early findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, aerobic activity should be used "as a first line intervention for knee osteoarthritis management, particularly when the aim is to improve functional capacity and reduce pain." They add that if aerobic exercise is not feasible because of individual limitations, "alternative forms of structured physical activity may still be beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.

It’s hard to isolate because larger chest and back muscles take over, and a weak mind–muscle connection often leaves it underdeveloped, creating the look of “wingless” lats. Schoeff emphasizes focused exercises like protraction pushups and cable pulldowns, which research shows produce higher electromyography activation than standard pressing movements. Neglecting the serratus anterior can lead to shoulder instability and poor mechanics over time. Viewers appreciate this callout, noting how serratus training improves posture, enhances arm definition, and supports stronger, more stable movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>开创性的艾滋病毒预防注射将在非洲开始- Barron's</title><link>https://www.barrons.com/news/groundbreaking-hiv-prevention-shots-to-begin-in-africa-c2be984a</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body" class="emotion-fbhy65 ex10ign10"&gt;&lt;section class="emotion-yfonvn-Container ef4qpkp0"&gt;&lt;p data-type="paragraph" data="[object Object]" class="emotion-1akm6h5-Paragraph e1e4oisd0"&gt;South Africa, Eswatini and Zambia were to begin on Monday administering a groundbreaking new HIV-prevention injection in the drug's first public rollouts in Africa, which has the world's highest HIV burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;div class="emotion-14l2doh ex10ign0"&gt;&lt;p data-id="standard_index_p"&gt;The Barron's news department was not involved in the creation of the content above.

			&lt;p&gt;The bumpy trajectory of human aging may have a tipping point as we enter our twilight years, a new study has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past the age of around 75, our bodies can no longer easily recover from injury or illness – a sharp decline in resilience that comes with a corresponding rise in the risk of dying, according to researchers at Dalhousie University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model looks at aging as a balance between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dying-cells-play-a-vital-unexpected-role-in-healing-study-shows"&gt;damage and repair&lt;/a&gt;, with the breakdown of that balance marking the point of no return into frailty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could help researchers and clinicians &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/standing-on-one-leg-can-reveal-a-huge-amount-about-your-health"&gt;better understand&lt;/a&gt; and plan for people's health care needs as they approach this tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-surprising-age-at-which-your-brain-reaches-its-peak"&gt;Study Reveals The Surprising Age at Which Your Brain Reaches Its Peak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We find that natural aging dynamics are non-trivial and include a tipping point near age 75 where robustness and resilience become insufficient and after which individuals tend towards worse health over time, marking an end to a robust and resilient youthful period," writes a team led by physicist Glen Pridham of Dalhousie University, in a preprint available on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.07795"&gt;arXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As several recent studies have revealed, the course of human aging isn't as smooth as you might think. Rather, the human body appears to undergo periods of accelerated aging while we're alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a recent study into the molecular changes associated with aging, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-aging-two-sharp-peaks"&gt;humans experience two drastic lurches forward&lt;/a&gt;, one at the average age of 44, and the other at the average age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, research also suggests there's at least one turning point during life when organ aging accelerates. A study published this year found &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;this turning point occurs at age 50&lt;/a&gt;, after which your tissues and organs age more rapidly than the decades preceding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we enter our twilight years, there's no denying that health problems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shockingly-common-injury-linked-with-increased-risk-of-dementia"&gt;become more serious&lt;/a&gt;, both in their frequency and severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increased vulnerability and susceptibility to health setbacks is clinically referred to as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cger.2010.08.009"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;, and doctors often use a tool called the &lt;a href="https://www.health.vic.gov.au/older-people-in-hospital/frailty/identifying-frailty"&gt;Frailty Index&lt;/a&gt;, based on the number of health deficits a patient has, to predict that patient's health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging.jpg" alt="Graph showing trajectories of normal and accelerated aging where people become increasingly frail." class="wp-image-181856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TrajectoriesOfHealthAndFunctionalDeclineWithAging-600x453.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Research is revealing that &lt;span&gt;aging isn't a steady process, as depicted here, but one with accelerations and tipping points. &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302593532_Cardiac_Senescence_Heart_Failure_and_Frailty_A_Triangle_in_Elderly_People"&gt;Shinmura, &lt;em&gt;The Keio Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2016&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pridham and his colleagues used the Frailty Index in a different way: to construct a new mathematical model of human aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they needed a robust dataset. They used data from the University of Michigan &lt;a href="https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about"&gt;Health and Retirement Study&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/"&gt;English Longitudinal Study of Ageing&lt;/a&gt;, which have tracked the health of thousands of people over many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;Scientists Reveal Turning Point When Your Body's Aging Accelerates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From those surveys, the researchers included data on 12,920 individuals who visited medical facilities 65,261 times between them, with a median age of 67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They quantified each participant's health using a Frailty Index comprising more than 30 attributes, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-key-way-to-slow-chronic-illness-in-old-age"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt;, difficulties performing tasks and activities, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;cardiovascular conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they built a mathematical model to analyze changes over time in two key health areas: adverse health events, such as illness or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-biomaterial-could-finally-repair-damaged-cartilage-in-injured-joints"&gt;injury&lt;/a&gt;, and the time it takes for participants to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-in-hospital-appears-to-speed-up-patient-recovery"&gt;recover from them&lt;/a&gt;, using the Frailty Index as a measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Frailty Index rose, it meant the participant was experiencing more health setbacks and recovering from them less effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, they found that both health setbacks and recovery time increased with age, until the participant reached a tipping point at which the recovery rate could no longer keep up with the rate of health setbacks. The age range for this tipping point was about 73 to 76 years for both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Beyond this tipping point, the ongoing loss of both robustness and resilience leads to a sharp increase in the Frailty Index and a commensurate increase in risk of mortality," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.07795"&gt;the researchers write in their preprint&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We infer that robustness and resilience mitigate environmental stressors only up to an age of 75, beyond which health deficits will increasingly accumulate, leading to death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not exactly cheery, but the good news is that this information could help soften or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-who-live-to-100-have-a-unique-relationship-with-disease"&gt;mitigate the effects&lt;/a&gt; of this tipping point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181858" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic.jpg" alt="Illustration of a grey-haired man with walking stick standing in front of a bed with a window to the right." class="wp-image-181858 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic.jpg 612w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/TipsOnHowToPreventFallsNIHInfographic-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181858" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Falls can lead to sharp declines in overall health, but they are preventable.

These differences were not driven by repetitive responding that is typical of autism. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251385029"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Autism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and patterns of behavior that may include strong interests and a preference for routine. Autistic individuals tend to experience the world with heightened or reduced sensitivity to sensory input, which can influence how they interact with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social behaviors of many autistic individuals differ from typical norms, but these differences often reflect communication styles rather than a lack of social motivation. Research shows that autistic individuals can display strong prosocial behaviors, such as helping, sharing, and comforting, especially when situations are clear and expectations are explicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to non-autistic individuals, autistic people tend to rely more on rules, fairness principles, or empathy based on understanding others’ situations rather than on reading subtle emotional cues. When tasks are structured and communication is direct, autistic individuals often show prosocial responses equal to or greater than their non-autistic peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Paul AG Forbes and his colleagues note that previous studies suggest that autistic individuals show a flatter decline in generosity towards socially distant others compared with non-autistic individuals. In other words, non-autistic individuals tend to be the most generous with the people closest to them, but their generosity decreases relatively quickly when more distant individuals (those they do not know well or at all) are considered. This decline in generosity is present in autistic individuals as well, but it is much slower and less steep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of this study wanted to know whether this less pronounced decline in generosity with social distance is a consequence of autistic individuals’ preference for repetitive responding (whereby they might respond in the same way regardless of how close the person is to them) or is caused by genuinely higher prosociality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 37 autistic and 38 non-autistic adults. They were recruited via a local database of participants at University College London. 36 of them were women. The average age of autistic individuals was 34, and it was 39 for the non-autistic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants first completed the six primary items of the Social Value Orientation (SVO) questionnaire. In these six items, they needed to allocate money to themselves and another person. The items offered various combinations of amounts allocated to the participant and to another individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In each item, combinations of amounts given to oneself and to the other are presented differently on a slider; therefore, choosing the same relative position on the slider in different items results in different distributions of money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants completed this six times with instructions each time to imagine an individual with a specific social distance from them, ranging from people very close to them, to people they barely know, to people who are complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For very close others, participants were told not to think of anyone with whom they share a household or a bank account (as giving money to those people might be like giving money to oneself), nor anyone they have negative feelings toward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the results reflected genuine behavior, the decisions were incentivized: participants were informed that a computer would randomly select choices to be paid out in real money. At the end of the study procedure, participants completed an assessment of attitudes towards money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that as the social distance increased, the generosity of non-autistic participants decreased faster than the generosity of autistic participants. In other words, autistic participants were more generous towards strangers and people they barely knew than non-autistic individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that these differences were not caused by repetitive behavior (i.e., autistic people’s preference to give the same answer every time). There were also no differences between the two groups in their attitudes toward money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Autistic individuals showed enhanced prosocial behavior, replicating previous work. Compared with non-autistic participants, autistic adults were more generous towards people they felt less close to. We extend previous work by showing that these effects were not due to more repetitive responding in autism nor due to differences in attitudes towards money. Our findings support an emerging view that while autistic people often face challenges navigating their social worlds, autism is associated with more prosocial behavior,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of autism. However, it should be noted that the study was conducted on a relatively small group of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613251385029"&gt;Increased prosocial value orientation in autistic adults,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Paul AG Forbes, Gillian Hughes, Leonhard Schilbach, Sarah White, and Tobias Kalenscher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 11:03:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNS1c4aWp2c0lkYUd6ZDM3S0NOeXdMeWNPb2RVbGtYOHJ1R2xIVTd4WlRycDFnSFZNYUtMTnNlMjVPbm9jMkwzNEZRc1BvZUlZd3Y4ZmhMYjU4TVlaVjBkZzdSRzB6WFc5cGxRS2pkMGVodHduRzZFcW1tX1o5cXlwY1h1dWo3dHM5WFNRNU43bjJCd2p1YVl3OVlUTm1MWWstNVQ3bnhqRHlBQUIwTVlN</guid></item><item><title>僧海豹禽流感疫苗试验内幕-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/01/science/hawaii-bird-flu-h5n1-monk-seals.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 10:30:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQZjZuVzhtRTl0Vld4elQ3LVptYV95ajF2VG5qYjJfZS0zZ3lpdjNrRVdfcFdkZDRwUXBERjhRT25xSG8xWjU1MW5hNUttRDBsaGgzZ3ZpaVotejFYQWsxOWEtcXl6aVBNd0R1LXVaVFhLOGsxdUlheXpDVFNKUkYtamhVMzZUdw</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，人类大脑在整个生命周期中有5个“时代” - NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/science/human-brains-eras-lifespans/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Treston, now the executive director of the Association of Nurses in AIDS Care and a member of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV and AIDS (PACHA), still remembers the quiet that fell over her mother as they walked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They moved slowly between the rows of hand-stitched panels, each honoring a life cut short. Her mother stopped in front of a section filled with birth years close to Treston’s own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“She said, ‘most of these have birth dates around the same as you,’” Treston recalled nearly four decades later. She described those early years of the epidemic as “very daunting, there was no hope, there was just an acceptance of death and loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For many younger Americans, the epidemic’s earliest grief-stricken years exist mainly in documentaries and history lessons. They have grown up in a world with antiretroviral therapy, prevention medication and the possibility of an undetectable viral load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As the country marks World AIDS Day, advocates warn that distance from those early epidemic years can obscure how fragile progress remains.

Multiple members also told ABC News the council has not met this year, raising questions about its ability to carry out its advisory role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the letter, members warn that “Although progress has been made, the United States continues to experience over 30,000 new HIV cases every year. Without continued investment, progress toward ending the HIV epidemic will stall, cases will increase again, and the health of Americans will suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;They point to the bipartisan Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative, launched in 2019, which helped drive a 12% drop in new infections. Fully funding the program, the council says, could save up to $100 billion in health care costs by 2030. But members say House proposals would eliminate funding for domestic and global HIV efforts, cut more than $1 billion from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and remove key parts of the Ryan White Program, which supports people living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said, “PACHA is a largely symbolic body whose members are engaging in another useless PR exercise that has no connection to the Trump administration’s robust work to tackle HIV and AIDS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“HHS is strengthening efforts to end the HIV epidemic by advancing next-generation HIV prevention and treatment options, strengthening viral suppression nationwide via HRSA’s Ryan White program, supporting emergency preparedness, and expanding access to trusted HIV information,” Desai added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For Treston, who has treated patients since 1986, the prospect of losing momentum feels painfully familiar, despite modern preventive tools that didn’t exist in those early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Another PACHA member, Tori Cooper, said the stakes are not abstract but matters of life and death for the communities she serves. A longtime HIV advocate, she works as director of community engagement for the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Transgender Justice Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We know that when people have HIV and it goes untreated, they die, and often they die horrible, painful deaths,” Cooper said. “And I'm not just talking about people who do ‘dirty things’ or ‘nasty things.’ I'm talking about people who perhaps were born living with HIV, or people who got it and didn't even know that they had it, or didn't know that their partners had it, folks who have been in monogamous relationships for years, it's all kinds of folks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cooper said she fears a rise in preventable illness if people cannot reach clinics or afford care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Because people aren't able to get tested to confirm an HIV diagnosis, that means they're not getting the care that they need to get to an undetectable viral load,” she said. “If they have detectable viral loads, then it makes it easier to pass HIV along to their sexual partners or during childbirth or through accidents or injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Philip Chan, an HIV physician in Rhode Island who drafted the first version of the letter, echoed those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“HIV is not a partisan issue,” Chan said. “HIV, similar to many other infectious diseases, does not discriminate based on, sex, religion, political party, it is important that we keep up our efforts to address this otherwise, more people will continue to be infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Chan noted that Ending the HIV Epidemic began under the Trump administration with the goal of ending new HIV infections by 75% by 2025 and 90% by 2030. He said progress could be lost without continued investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For Treston, the quilt remains a reminder of the lives her generation lost, but she believes the country still has an opportunity to avoid repeating the past. She points to the bipartisan legacy of HIV policy, from early federal HIV bills to PEPFAR to the Ryan White Program, as proof that the United States can protect its progress if it chooses to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;“We have the tools to stop new HIV infections and keep people who are already positive healthy,” she said. “We can end the HIV epidemic, but only if we continue the federal support that made these gains possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2025 10:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNN1ZsOHFTY2ItQ3h1R1ZYbU1DaEZFeEVzSEFSUlcxMlZLaFlfVDV5RFhETHFrYWdHV1luSkh5VmpxeU1zeDcwb1JZX0UyaHV6ekpVOV85aWhnSXFoVXliMXhJNDhwRXhXVU9XbE83S283ZkZZMkR3VlJDbElpLTBSdUpGWWZ1dmxyRjc4WVl3NkRoOEFON3RtbTViU2k5emZldjVZLTJMWW5ScFFfTkE1VtIBtgFBVV95cUxPRlFlcWx4dzI0WDlUc0VKUGE2TGpaVzdlQVFwTlF0WnB3NW9Bejhjc3REdUxwMTF1RnBvekxuZnAtTlZtdkR1bGwySDNfYVNCSDdVMnNOcTBSVDdCV1hETWlVWmw1Y0NHUXFGTEluMVFuZE5HMGxoemFMNDAtRFJmNUhKUjcxVXZxeFN6VHF3MHFEak5DaE45WnBQYTJpQ29hVl9mZjhWSVBCbUV5eEdWZC1Nd3FBZw</guid></item><item><title>为什么唱歌对你的健康有惊人的好处- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251128-how-singing-can-improve-your-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Singing also activates a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/hbm.21173" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;broad network of neurons on both sides of our brain&lt;/a&gt;, causing regions that deal with language, movement and emotion to light up.

Some anthropologists &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-017-9607-x" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that our hominid ancestors sang before they could speak, using vocalisations to mimic the sounds of nature or express feelings. This may have played a key role in the development of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150221" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;complex social dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2153599X.2023.2197977" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;emotional expression and ritual&lt;/a&gt;, and Street points out that it's no accident that singing is part of every human's life, whether musically inclined or not, noting that our brains and bodies are attuned from birth to respond in positive ways to song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Lullabies are sung to children, and then songs are sung at funerals," he says. "We learn our times tables through chanting, and our ABCs through the rhythmic and melodic structure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="come-together" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="come-together" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Come together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But not all types of singing are equally beneficial.

   &lt;p&gt;Prediabetes is common in the U.S. — around 1 in 3 people have it. And many people may not know they have it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For prediabetic people, their glucose levels are higher than people without diabetes – but not quite in the diabetic range.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You may see higher glucose rises after certain meals," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://medicine.ucsf.edu/people/sarah-kim" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Kim&lt;/a&gt; is a diabetologist and professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco. "And you might see it go up after you eat a cherry pie…. You may see bigger changes in your glucose, whether you're sedentary versus active."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The FDA approved the first over-the-counter &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;continuous glucose monito&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. Since then, more people who are prediabetic or without a diabetes diagnosis have started checking in on their blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Kim says while these devices may not offer much insight for people without diabetes, they can be empowering for those looking to make lifestyle changes or better understand their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more science of the human body?

LEN, a highly effective, long-acting alternative to oral pills and other options, is a transformative intervention for people who face challenges with regular adherence and stigma in accessing health care. WHO released in July this year  &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240111608"&gt;new guidelines recommending the use of lenacapavir&lt;/a&gt; as an additional pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) option for HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp and sudden reductions in international funding this year led to disruptions in HIV prevention, treatment and testing services, with essential community-led programmes, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and harm reduction initiatives for people who inject drugs, being scaled back or shut down entirely in some countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We face significant challenges, with cuts to international funding, and prevention stalling," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “At the same time, we have significant opportunities, with exciting new tools with the potential to change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic. Expanding access to those tools for people at risk of HIV everywhere must be priority number one for all governments and partners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marking &lt;a href="/campaigns/world-aids-day/2025"&gt;World AIDS Day&lt;/a&gt; under the theme &lt;em&gt;“Overcoming disruption, transforming the AIDS response”&lt;/em&gt;, WHO is urging a dual track approach – solidarity and investment in innovations to protect and empower communities most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After decades of progress, the HIV response stands at a crossroads. In 2024:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;HIV prevention efforts stagnated, with 1.3 million new infections, disproportionately impacting key and vulnerable populations; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-50099489" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/2025-WAD-report_en.pdf?utm_source=UNAIDS+Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=b06b95a07b-2025-world-aids-day-report&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_e7a6256e25-b06b95a07b-50099489" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;UNAIDS data&lt;/a&gt; reveal that almost half (49%) of new HIV infections occurred among key populations – including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender women, and people who inject drugs – and their sexual partners; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;while sex workers and transgender women face a 17-fold higher risk of acquiring HIV, men who have sex with men face an 18-fold higher risk, and people who inject drugs – a 34-fold higher risk; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;underlying drivers include stigma, discrimination, and legal, social and structural barriers these groups face to access HIV care; and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;globally, an estimated 40.8 million people were living with HIV, and 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the full scale of the impact of foreign aid cuts is still being assessed, access to PrEP is believed to have declined dramatically. The AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition estimates that, as of October 2025, 2.5 million people who used PrEP in 2024 lost access to their medications in 2025 due solely to donor funding cuts. Such disruptions could have far-reaching consequences for the global HIV response, jeopardizing efforts to end AIDS by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Momentum for innovation&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;“We are entering a new era of powerful innovations in HIV prevention and treatment,” said Dr Tereza Kasaeva, Director of WHO’s Department for HIV, TB, Hepatitis and STIs. “By pairing these advances with decisive action, supporting communities, and removing structural barriers, we can ensure that key and vulnerable populations have full access to life-saving services.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO prequalified LEN for HIV prevention on 6 October 2025, followed by national regulatory approvals that will increase access in South Africa (on 27 October), Zimbabwe (27 November) and Zambia (4 November). WHO’s Collaborative Registration Procedure (CRP) supported these approvals. WHO is also working closely with partners such as CIFF, the Gates Foundation, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and Unitaid to enable affordable access to LEN in countries. Ensuring that long-acting HIV medicines for prevention and treatment reach priority populations must be a global priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Integrating HIV services into primary health care&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;WHO emphasizes that ending the AIDS epidemic depends on a fully integrated, evidence-based and rights-driven approach under the umbrella of primary health care. WHO will continue working with partners and leaders to put those most affected at the centre of the HIV response. Despite funding setbacks, the resilience and leadership of communities offer a clear path forward. By strengthening health systems, increasing domestic investment, and protecting human rights, countries can safeguard gains and ensure no one is left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
