Fans of the so-called fart walk—a short stroll taken up to about an hour after eating a meal—claim it aids digestion and relieves GI symptoms like gas and bloating. But what do doctors think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New name, old concept&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Feeling bloated after a meal is common,” says Dr. David D. Clarke, a clinical assistant professor of gastroenterology emeritus at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and president of the Association of the Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms. That’s because people eat too much, or they eat too quickly and swallow excess air, or they drink beverages with dissolved gas in them like soda or beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter symptoms like these and help relieve gas naturally, walking after dinner can help, doctors agree. Walking can enhance the muscle contractions of the gastrointestinal tract—a wave-like movement called peristalsis—which can help pass the gas as belches or flatulence, explains Clarke. Research has also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9325803/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long supported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;long supported&lt;/a&gt; taking a postprandial walk for a different reason: it helps reduce blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The varied benefits of a fart walk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one social media trend physicians can get behind. A fart walk helps relieve symptoms of bloating and gas and promotes motility of the bowels, says Dr. Shawn Khodadadian of Manhattan Gastroenterology in New York City. Clarke agrees; mild-to-moderate exercise, such as walking, helps the stomach empty more quickly, improving transit through the intestinal tract and clearing out gas and waste through the digestive system, all of which can help alleviate issues like bloating and constipation, he says. “Walking promotes muscle contractions in the stomach and intestines that can lead to belching and farting,” he says. That quicker emptying will also “decrease the time that acid is present in the stomach,” which relieves heartburn in most people, Clarke says. (However, some people with poor tone in the sphincter muscle—at the junction of the esophagus and stomach—might experience more acid reflux when stomach contractions are stimulated by walking, he warns.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://time.com/7269178/what-is-sleepmaxxing-sleep-doctors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Doctors Really Think of Sleepmaxxing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Doctors Really Think of Sleepmaxxing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fart walking may be particularly beneficial for those with medical conditions like &lt;a href="https://time.com/7020813/do-i-have-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:irritable bowel syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (IBS) and &lt;a href="https://time.com/5023122/eating-fast-obesity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. “There have been studies that show that mobility in general can lead to decreased sensation of gas and bloating in patients with IBS symptoms,” says Khodadadian. Plus, a post-meal stroll’s ability to  better regulate blood sugar is especially helpful for people with metabolic syndrome, he says. &lt;a href="https://time.com/6975058/backward-walking-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Short walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Short walks&lt;/a&gt; after eating can also benefit the heart: helping to &lt;a href="https://time.com/4853121/muscle-weight-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stave off weight gain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stave off weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, improve circulation, lower blood pressure, support overall cardiovascular fitness, says Khodadadian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other perks of fart walking might include reducing the risk of diabetes, Clarke says. “Walking after a meal facilitates removal of blood sugar by the muscles and thereby reduces the need for insulin secretion by the pancreas,” Clarke says, which may reduce the risk for the future development of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A postprandial amble can also brighten your mood. “The addition of aerobic exercise has been shown to improve stress, anxiety, and mild depression,” says Khodadadian. “This can happen by reducing baseline &lt;a href="https://time.com/7267244/cortisol-levels-hormones-throughout-the-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cortisol levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt; over time, by improving sleep quality, and by increasing levels of chemicals such as endorphins, dopamine and serotonin in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get the most out of your fart walk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fart walks don’t have to be long to be effective. Aim for at least four to five minutes of light-to-moderate paced walking within about an hour of finishing a meal. (More is better: for more sustained GI benefits, shoot for 30–60 minutes of moderate-paced walking on most days of the week, Clarke says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is generally healthy for everyone, and it should not be strenuous—but if you have had recent surgery, motility issues, abdominal distress, arthritis, or heart or lung issues, you should check with your doctor first before proceeding, adds Khodadadian. Based on your medical history, recommendations may vary for precisely how long you walk, he says, but the goal is ultimately to be able to engage in an appropriate level of exercise—including fart walking—for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20Is%20Taking%20a%20'Fart%20Walk'%20Good%20for%20Your%20Health?&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7299648%2Fwhat-is-fart-walk%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 18:29:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBkX0ZWVFdTaDk4ZlljbTN1eWdoVGluWW81ZUp6aWZZeGRYZ0J4eXVfRWxhRVRneV9icVR3SURMWkVEVzJaRDFFdlR4blY5ZjI2SjBaWkdzaUNiX1Z2c25tOV9VTWI3SnFvblk0b3V1V2g</guid></item><item><title>犹他州宣布更多麻疹病例—大多数感染者都在一个县-盐湖论坛报 | Utah announces more measles cases — and most of those infected are in one county - The Salt Lake Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE1Wd0h3RFZpYXNPRXlzSU9XSGY2azQyR3Z1RS01NjFTOGxHT09zaXRrZ3AtSE03b3EtaEo0S1llV00xbjhFXzJkbUVDSkpLeHpvSlgxNjdnSm8tUEJaME5BaHM4NUxoamtPdUtUZmlCQ2sybUVnTDBtdXNmaUM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-head"&gt;&lt;h1 class="headline"&gt;Utah announces more measles cases — and most of those infected are in one county&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-subheadline"&gt;There have now been nine verified measles infections in the state, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services reports&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="image-rootLeft"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1ez1ofp"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background "&gt;&lt;span class="image-img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption-credit"&gt;(Francisco Kjolseth  | The Salt Lake Tribune) Public health officials warn of the first verified case of measles in Utah as Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, gives an update on a adult from Utah County diagnosed with the highly contagious disease on Friday, June 20, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="f0fvPICkDdVr4HR" data-fusion-collection="features" data-fusion-type="article-byline/default" data-fusion-message="Could not render component [features:article-byline/default]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f0fSQqI7MjYN5RL" data-fusion-collection="features" data-fusion-type="article-group-buttons/default" data-fusion-message="Could not render component [features:article-group-buttons/default]"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-container" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note to readers •&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Salt Lake Tribune is making this story free to all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The Utah Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed nine measles cases in the state of Utah, as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to the department, seven of the people who have been infected reside in Utah County, and two live in the southwest portion of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The two new infections from Utah County were added to the department’s online count on Friday, and the other two were added on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Each of the four newly infected people were known contacts to people who previously had been infected, the department said, “and were being actively monitored for measles symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Each of the nine people infected are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;People who are infected, the department has said, typically see symptoms one to two weeks after they are exposed. Those symptoms can include a fever higher than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as cough, runny nose and red eyes. After about four days of the fever, people then typically start developing a rash. According to state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen, the rash usually starts in peoples’ hairline before spreading across their face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective in protecting people against measles if they are given two doses, according to the state department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Last Thursday, the department announced two cases, which brought the then-total amount of infected people to five, including one child. Health officials said that in both of those new cases, the department knew those people had been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Among those first five cases, two of the infected people had been pregnant, and two had been hospitalized and released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department recommends that people who plan to get pregnant should get vaccinated before becoming pregnant, to protect themselves and their baby through their pregnancy. Women who are pregnant cannot get the vaccine, according to the department, and pregnant people with measles face a higher risk for miscarriages and stillbirth — as well as medical issues for the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Nolen said people who are still unvaccinated should talk seriously with their doctors about their choice, and stressed that adults choosing to get vaccinated help protect babies who are not yet big enough to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;A higher percentage of people in southern parts of Utah are unvaccinated, Nolen said, compared with other areas of the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20not%20a%20seasonal,quarters%20(like%20summer%20camp)." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20not%20a%20seasonal,quarters%20(like%20summer%20camp)."&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, there have been 27 outbreaks and a total of 1,267 confirmed measles cases throughout the country as of Tuesday. Three of those people have died because of the measles. The CDC reports there were a total of 285 confirmed cases in the United States in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Though the CDC says “measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000,” the disease is currently spreading because “U.S. MMR coverage among kindergarteners is now below the 95% coverage target” and is decreasing, and “global measles activity is increasing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In Utah’s 2024-25 school year, about 10% of kindergarteners either had an exemption from receiving the MMR vaccine or did not have documents that showed they were vaccinated, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:59:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1Wd0h3RFZpYXNPRXlzSU9XSGY2azQyR3Z1RS01NjFTOGxHT09zaXRrZ3AtSE03b3EtaEo0S1llV00xbjhFXzJkbUVDSkpLeHpvSlgxNjdnSm8tUEJaME5BaHM4NUxoamtPdUtUZmlCQ2sybUVnTDBtdXNmaUM</guid></item><item><title>性建议：我的嗅觉发生了戏剧性的转变。它让性变得难以忍受。- Slate Magazine | Sex advice: My sense of smell has taken a dramatic turn.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4veju00123b760nvsdws3@published"&gt;I’m a 45-year-old pansexual woman. I’m in the early stages of perimenopause and have noticed some changes to my body. Mostly, they’re not too concerning to me because perimenopause is normal, and most symptoms are easy to deal with. My vagina is a little dryer, so I use more lube and my armpits are more sweaty, so I use more antiperspirant. But there’s one symptom that’s really creating some issues for me. My sense of smell is off the charts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vel900133b76igu8wrqc@published"&gt;If I’m in the car with someone who is talking, their breath is unbearable. I can smell stinky cheese in the fridge when the fridge is closed. Worst of all, the smell of bodies has become extremely off-putting. I’m not talking about bad body odor—just regular human smells. I recently started to get serious with a lovely genderqueer person, and we have great physical chemistry. But the smell of their skin, breath, and hair turns my stomach. If I focus on the sensations in my body, I can sometimes put the smells out of my mind. But other times, I just can’t, and I avoid any physical contact or even sitting too close to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vemw00143b76v4adusbp@published"&gt;I’ve tried showering with them before sex to see if that helps (it doesn’t) and using scented products on my own skin to see if I can drown out their smell (I can’t). I know it’s me, and they smell perfectly normal. I don’t know how to bring this up without making them feel bad or self-conscious. And I’m especially loath to mention something that the other person cannot help or change. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

Though hormonal changes can often result in an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56565-x"&gt;impaired sense of smell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bywinona.com/journal/smell-and-taste?srsltid=AfmBOorXiZVQzk07mKUIqYeTZcF7vkoTqcx8ioVhUxnQFc4FNXK0Q7UO"&gt;anecdotal evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows that some people report a menopause-related heightened sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vesm00183b76ib14sit1@published"&gt;But like many things that affect women, these changes are poorly understood, and thus, there are not a lot of great solutions. You might start by seeing your doctor about any perimenopause-induced changes—there are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354671"&gt;treatments for the vaginal dryness you mention, for example, that they might recommend&lt;/a&gt;. As for the odors, I did see that someone in a Reddit thread recommended &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DY9N6LJ?th=1"&gt;this aromatherapy diffuser&lt;/a&gt;, which is a scented silicone ring that you wear like a septum piercing to mask whatever odors are making your life hell. There are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mini-Essential-Nose-Ring-Inhaler/dp/B0DL615Y69/ref=sr_1_15?crid=2VNM81LP2CVJQ&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lRtwMHia39Q4gQseAOh0VYPc7rP2VgIpXoompMRgREd6Ot-npIR1tJ5xkau-hfYBrMFq8ExZxedjfW_22cci63lk-HQ352H2wxS3n3LffWElewfBknSw8aX81TtN3BEqWNIenOeg_PiNy_2g-XizWTmwLq-p_vrXB9zaujKzQg0v2tq7_8iH7P4vvlfYuOTGRz-pI-m87xNTgnIN1lPmn3g1yTr7FKCtEryn5fLwLA2V9rEdZ6wUswHYHkDtZgdgA2PBEniRE1qI2LCAC60Ugwp4c5pQ8jZ6nJl_W1u3l64.hX-XZ-3mHXcPxIYaljbr1We5rt5H3OuKwLueboKb6NE&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=silicone+nose+ring+for+essential+oils&amp;amp;qid=1751224361&amp;amp;sprefix=silicone+nose+ring+for,aps,116&amp;amp;sr=8-15&amp;amp;th=1"&gt;other options&lt;/a&gt;, too. The hurdle here might be finding an essential oil that doesn’t also turn your stomach. That may be a challenge in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4veu300193b76q487nv4l@published"&gt;I do think that you can bring this up with your new partner in a way that won’t necessarily make them feel bad. You can explain that this is something that many menopausal women have reported. Rarely has “It’s not you, it’s me” been so apt and benign. It is literally the case. This is not about you being particularly sensitive about &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; smell; it is about being sensitive to &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; smells. (Citing the cheese-in-fridge example will be useful to show that. Think about whether there are other disturbing non-human smells that you can also point to.) Perhaps your partner can try to work with fragrance on themself to help mask their musk. Another possible solution? A nose clip that could effectively cut off &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; smells. Swimmers often use these (though you’d have to be pretty confident breathing through your mouth). Of course, wearing one without explanation would be extremely curious, so a conversation would be useful there.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vevq001a3b76vaie8zc5@published"&gt;Your heightened sense of smell is not your fault and it should not be taken personally by an inadvertent offender. Hopefully your partner is mature enough to understand this and attempt to work with you (or at least not hold it against you for working through it yourself). You don’t have to get super specific about being distracted during sex—just keep it general, say it’s something that is affecting all facets of your life, and frame it as an issue to overcome so that you can continue to spend time with this person that you are so fond of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vlwx001n3b76brmvoueb@published"&gt;My boyfriend ejaculates A LOT. We tried condoms early on in our relationship, but I’ve had to switch to the pill after he literally overflowed a condom on more than one occasion. He says this has been going on since he was 20 (he’s 25 now). One time, he jerked off into a disposable measuring cup, and the amount totaled just over a quarter cup. When we have sex, I have to make sure I get to the bathroom fast after we finish to avoid a mess when things begin to leak. Is it normal for him to produce so much?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vlwy001q3b76yua2kgl9@published"&gt;Well, it’s &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; normal! It sounds like he has &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/hyperspermia-8746676"&gt;hyperspermia&lt;/a&gt;, a medical condition that is generally considered benign. Typically, hyperspermia refers to semen volume that is above 6 milliliters or about 1.20 teaspoons (typical volume is &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003627.htm"&gt;1.5 to 5 milliliters per ejaculation&lt;/a&gt;). It may lead to fertility issues, perhaps because of the lower sperm concentration within the high fluid content, and the cause (at least for some) may have to do with an inflamed prostate, but other than that, it’s not really a thing doctors fret over.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vlwy001r3b76hhak56yc@published"&gt;Many people enjoy it—big loads are prized by some. My X feed for a few months has regularly been showing me posts from people who have added zinc to their supplement stack and now are supposedly shooting mega loads (this is anecdotal at best and not going to work for everyone—I’m not convinced it’s even working for those engagement farmers). There are a number of supplements marketed to boost semen volume (for science, I’ve tried some and seen no change in my production). There’s a whole subreddit devoted to people capturing their giant loads on film (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperspermia/"&gt;r/hyperspermia&lt;/a&gt;—NSFW obviously). And porn has done a lot to argue the inherent value in copious cum delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

One &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221892317_Seminal_Volume_in_the_Investigation_of_Male_Infertility"&gt;study of semen volume found&lt;/a&gt; only 7.88 percent of 1,521 participants had what qualified as hyperspermia. So while your boyfriend’s condition may be rare, it’s far from unheard of. Try to find the joy in his gushes of love.&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s certainly possible that your husband is not being truthful or even deceiving you, there are other potential explanations worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vud700293b768a8soqzw@published"&gt;For starters, he could just be telling the truth. Parenthood can be tough for some to navigate, and it can take months or years before elements of both of your lives return to looking like they did previous to the child. The stress of new parenting will affect different people in different ways. It’s completely understandable that some men will experience a swift kick to the libido (stress is, after all, a notorious &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-stress-can-lead-to-low-libido-3145029"&gt;sex drive killer&lt;/a&gt;). It doesn’t mean your husband isn’t attracted to you or that he’s putting his sexual energy elsewhere—he just might not be able to muster it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vud7002a3b76g7mqewqt@published"&gt;For some men, it also takes a while to bounce back after the baby is born. If your husband watched you give birth, he may be experiencing what Dr. Keith Ablow described in a New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/health/a-perilous-journey-from-delivery-room-to-bedroom.html"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; some 20 years ago as a “post-traumatic stress disorder, with its roots in the witnessing of an event that involves a threat to the physical integrity of self or others and responding with intense fear, helplessness or horror.” In the piece Ablow describes having seen “dozens” of male patients presenting this kind of response after seeing their significant others give birth. Recognizing this is the first step—&lt;a href="https://health.cornell.edu/sites/health/files/pdf-library/sensate-focus.pdf"&gt;sensate focus&lt;/a&gt; (mindful touching) and general mindfulness may help ease affected men back toward having sex with their partners.

I think you should give him a bit more time. If you’re feeling insecure, tell him that. Ask for reassurance that he’s still attracted to you and isn’t having an affair. Inquire about what he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; willing to offer intimacy-wise. It could be holding, massaging, kissing, or cuddling. There is some compromise to strike between where you are right now and where he is. If you don’t see progress (or at least an acknowledgement on his part that your sex life has changed considerably and that he’s willing to explore getting back on track) within a few more months, though, consider counseling.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vx72002o3b76pargobe0@published"&gt;I’m a healthy 43-year-old male with a robust sex drive. I take blood pressure medicine that causes my erections to be slightly less than ideal—not all the way ED, but noticeably less than great. My primary care doctor prescribed me Viagra for this, which has been working great for a few years now. About a year ago, mid-pandemic, my wife left me. In the last few months I’ve begun a new relationship with a woman I feel very comfortable with, and our sex life is fantastic. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/07/telling-girlfriend-viagra-use-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, she has no idea I use Viagra…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderna&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRNA" target="_blank"&gt;MRNA&lt;/a&gt;) stock popped Wednesday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the company's RSV vaccine for at-risk adults in their 50s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reportedly sided with the previous Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices which, in April, recommended Moderna's mResvia for adults ages 50 to 59 who have a high risk of developing severe respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The virus causes coldlike symptoms in most people, but can be serious or deadly in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the former ACIP and installed his own panel of experts to weigh the risks and benefits of vaccines. So, the future of Moderna's mResvia remained cloudy. But, on June 25, &lt;a href="https://endpoints.news/cdc-expands-rsv-vaccine-recommendations-siding-with-previous-panel-of-agency-advisors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kennedy adopted&lt;/a&gt; the prior panel's recommendation, industry publication Endpoints News reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Investor's Business Daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trades, Moderna stock 5.8% to 30.30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expanded RSV Vaccine Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSV vaccine is Moderna's second commercial product, following its original Covid vaccine. It competes against shots from &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pfizer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE" target="_blank"&gt;PFE&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;GSK&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSK" target="_blank"&gt;GSK&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was originally approved and recommended for adults ages 75 and older, and for adults ages 60 to 74 with an increased risk of developing severe RSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision Wednesday expands the market for mResvia which, in the first quarter, widely missed sales forecasts. The biopharma industry was watching Kennedy's decision as an indicator of how closely Kennedy could follow the ACIP's nonbinding recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderna stock is currently trading above its &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/"&gt;50-day moving average&lt;/a&gt;, but below its &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/"&gt;200-day line&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq"&gt;MarketSurge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Pop culture references such as Ebenezer Scrooge attributing the ghosts that visit him to “a crumb of cheese” in “A Christmas Carol,” and a 20th-century comic strip depicting people’s unsettling dreams as the result of feasting on Welsh rarebit — a cheese-on-toast dish — have only perpetuated that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1544475/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1544475/full"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology put to the test those long-held assumptions about dairy-related sleeping problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at MacEwan University surveyed 1,082 students to test people’s perceptions of how food impacts their dreams. The survey asked the students about their eating habits in general and before bed, food sensitivity, and sleep habits and quality, including dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-findings-..." class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The findings ...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Almost half of the surveyed participants reported that certain foods either worsened or improved their sleep. While 20% said food improved their sleep, nearly 25% agreed it worsened their sleep, and 5% noted it affected their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the researchers, those who perceived food-dependent dreaming experienced more frequent and disturbing dreams and often ignored hunger cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The majority of participants who attributed their poor sleep to food believed that sweets, spicy foods or dairy were to blame. Sweets were blamed the most, at 31%, whereas dairy was 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5604" data-height="3736"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/E7LSTPGHAFFKRPSK5ZFGTNJC3Y.jpg?auth=564ef522561c9a091513ac826d22ddba1b1d610b493453b4680ef25eb0635172&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/E7LSTPGHAFFKRPSK5ZFGTNJC3Y.jpg?auth=564ef522561c9a091513ac826d22ddba1b1d610b493453b4680ef25eb0635172&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Snickers bars from Brazil are displayed for sale at Economy Candy in New York's Lower East Side, Friday, April 4, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Richard Drew, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;However, worse sleep perceptions were tied to lactose intolerance and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as late-night snacking. About 30% percent of people who believed their diet negatively affected their sleep were lactose intolerant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“These new findings imply that changing eating habits for people with some food sensitivities could alleviate nightmares,” Dr. Tore Nielsen of Université de Montréal, lead author of the article, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1088938?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1088938?"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released with the published article. “They could also explain why people so often blame dairy for bad dreams!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Consuming dairy might trigger gastrointestinal disturbances, and the resulting discomfort could impact people’s dreams and the quality of their rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Foods-that-improve-sleep" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Foods that improve sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As recorded in the study, some participants reported improved sleep when consuming fruits and vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nearly 18% of people that eat fruit regularly reported improved sleep, as did 12% of those who consume a lot of vegetables and 13% of those who drink herbal tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5472" data-height="3648"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CY5JOSK34ZETFMAJ57QDTFYS4U.jpg?auth=9fde9b4a12f29d0f15b80c239a7825c253dfee235e587ac00da68c8df4295c01&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CY5JOSK34ZETFMAJ57QDTFYS4U.jpg?auth=9fde9b4a12f29d0f15b80c239a7825c253dfee235e587ac00da68c8df4295c01&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Vegetables are displayed for sale at a grocery store in River Ridge, La., on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Gerald Herbert, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Dietary-restrictions" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Dietary restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The research confirmed a strong link between food and sleep, with food sensitivities such as lactose intolerance as contributors to nightmare prevalence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;However, the exact relationship between diet and sleep is unclear. People might sleep poorly due to poor diet, or vice versa, or another factor could affect both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Suggesting that tummy troubles from dairy could cause strange or unsettling dreams, these findings opened the door for new research into how food affects dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, the implications might be enough for some individuals to adjust their own diets without professional intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3696" data-height="2862"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HJRUD3M56ZHXNMZFEOAA5E6ELY.jpg?auth=6187501911ff23f7584efe5c8e3bd6eab2688888d23bae897b06959627d9196e&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=619" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HJRUD3M56ZHXNMZFEOAA5E6ELY.jpg?auth=6187501911ff23f7584efe5c8e3bd6eab2688888d23bae897b06959627d9196e&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1238 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;A shopper peruses cheese offerings at a Target store on Oct. 4, 2023, in Sheridan, Colo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| David Zalubowski, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:15:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9fa2YzTEcxaVdPcHJDZFkydkZZQmZ4T0lGY290T1hDbU1EYk1uVWZZckNhSlZCZDV6VXdsb2xkdDlWLURNb0RkYUpGNHVSY3I0YXpnTkVjNldJT0luQ3VJajJRTGQtdllUaXZ3MGlmQ250Qm5VQURWYQ</guid></item><item><title>专家警告不要使用有望消除压力和疲劳的病毒性鸡尾酒- dailymail.co.uk | Experts warn against viral cocktail that promises to banish stress and exhaustion - dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZWE3dURPUXdKbjE4Y3czd1lMWEc0eDhiODAyazN5WHFWcXdRbW03QjRPRDhOQmM4djVwVzZyeG1kTGttcHFfTVN6WlNqRGtMMTNQV3VINW1iU0R4clEza0VkaFk3cFh4Z0psTDNrZHlqbHpUSThFYUI4dkp0ZEQ0dF9mcEF3SzllTWljTTBGelNlMHZycmRfcVdKcVpwOS03YmlReVUyMnA0QdIBrwFBVV95cUxNSm1fbExGTzF1YXlUVkxXQ1hPcmlZWC1YOWgzVUFzQ1U3R011N2hBTFZ2SExtNklHSG12LUVzeURqV0FjYzVrMWJzUnVhUk93YzlVNDNBZmRCSDBqT3h4VGZxY0JQampnSXM4eEtabUpxMG1hM0xNZjZIQ3Q2YlBOMjE1MGZkcmJ4SDRCR2twQktDTVM0NXEteUtuYy1ROE5QSW5xV1JqR2VsNUEwN3Nv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A cocktail of fruit juices, sparkling water and vitamin powder might be the key to slashing stress hormones, influencers claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social media influencers say they've concocted a viral 'cocktail' that lowers levels of cortisol, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13951165/what-addisons-disease-causes-symptoms-overview.html"&gt;stress hormone that triggers the body's 'fight-or-flight' response&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also regulates metabolism, blood sugar, blood pressure, inflammation and sleep, among other functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But too much cortisol can throw these processes into overdrive, leading to weight gain, heart disease, high cholesterol and infertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 'cortisol cocktail' contains ingredients that could keep cortisol under control with a mix of coconut water, lemon, orange juice, sea salt and sparkling water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The finishing touch is about a teaspoon of magnesium, a mineral that supports nearly 300 bodily processes, including immune health, muscle function and energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told DailyMail.com that while the drink's ingredients all support relaxation and mood, they're unlikely to significantly lower cortisol levels on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggested people with consistently high cortisol should instead focus on more proven strategies like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-12350731/I-dropped-44LBS-menopause-weight-targeting-cortisol-levels-using-four-simple-hacks.html"&gt;exercise and eating a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Influencers have claimed a viral 'cocktail' lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol, but doctors speaking to DailyMail.com expressed doubts (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Charles Carlsen, an OBGYN and chief technology officer at DRSONO Medical, told this website: 'While ingredients in the cortisol cocktail, like magnesium and coconut water, have recognized medical properties — magnesium stimulates a feeling of calm and coconut water is a hydrator — there is not a lot of scientific evidence to support arguments that a given drink lowers stress hormones significantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The nutrients in these drinks may support overall good health but are not a cure-all when it comes to stress hormones.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jeffrey Ditzell, a psychiatrist in New York City, added: 'There is likely more hype than help with cortisol cocktails.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cortisol is known as the 'stress hormone' because it increases blood pressure and heart rate to put the body into 'fight-or-flight' mode and raises blood sugar levels to provide energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Atkinson, clinical lead at healthcare service company Treated, told DailyMail.com: 'When you encounter stress, your body raises its cortisol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cortisol also plays a part in regulating your blood pressure, immune system, and sleep-wake cycle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hormone is produced by the adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys. Too little cortisol can send the body into an adrenal crisis, leading to low blood pressure, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, fever and trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But high cortisol levels can slow metabolism, raise cholesterol levels, increase heart rate and blood pressure and disrupt sleep, Dr Carlsen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Concerns arise when someone has persistent symptoms like fatigue, insomnia, mood changes, or unexplained weight changes; especially if accompanied by physical signs like high blood pressure or abdominal weight gain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlsen noted doctors can test for elevated cortisol with blood, saliva and urine samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Angela Downey, a family physician at The Codependent Doctor, told DailyMail.com: 'The tests are often done at specific times during the day as your cortisol naturally changes through the day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the cortisol cocktail's main ingredients is about 200 milligrams of magnesium powder, which costs anywhere from $15 to $30 per tub, depending on the size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended daily dose is about 400 to 420 milligrams for men and 310 to 320 milligrams for women.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Atkinson said while magnesium deficiency has been linked to high cortisol, 'raising your magnesium levels won't happen instantly by including around 200 milligrams of it in a drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's no guarantee how much magnesium in a supplement form your body will absorb, so if you know your magnesium levels are low, you'd probably be better off trying to include more magnesium-rich foods in your diet, such as whole grains, legumes and nuts.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The cortisol cocktail contains coconut water, lemon and orange juice, magnesium powder, sea salt and sparkling water (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, drinking multiple cortisol cocktails in a day could raise the risk of magnesium toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlsen told this website: 'Over intake of magnesium leads to diarrhea, stomach discomfort, and various gastrointestinal symptoms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also added 'excessive magnesium is also not good in kidney disease patients,' as they can't properly filter out magnesium and other nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even ingredients like fruit juice and sparkling water, Dr Atkinson said, could cause gastrointestinal discomfort, especially in people who have one of these drinks every day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Orange juice and coconut water, meanwhile, are hydrating and packed with inflammation-lowering vitamin C, they can also be high in added sugars, 'which might not be ideal for people with insulin resistance, diabetes or PCOS,' Dr Downey told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlsen instead points to habits like diet and exercise and tried and true ways top lower cortisol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderate exercise like cycling, tennis and yoga, for example, is thought to reduce cortisol by producing mood-boosting hormones called endorphins and improving sleep quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods rich in antioxidants like berries, dark chocolate and green tea also lower inflammation and prevent stress-induced cell damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlsen added: 'While there is possible benefit with the hydrating and refreshing ingredients of a cortisol cocktail, it is not a definitive fix to low cortisol. Evidence-based remedies like a good-health lifestyle and stress relief are superior long-term fixes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Always consult with a healthcare specialist should you be concerned with your level of cortisol or general health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:43:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZWE3dURPUXdKbjE4Y3czd1lMWEc0eDhiODAyazN5WHFWcXdRbW03QjRPRDhOQmM4djVwVzZyeG1kTGttcHFfTVN6WlNqRGtMMTNQV3VINW1iU0R4clEza0VkaFk3cFh4Z0psTDNrZHlqbHpUSThFYUI4dkp0ZEQ0dF9mcEF3SzllTWljTTBGelNlMHZycmRfcVdKcVpwOS03YmlReVUyMnA0QdIBrwFBVV95cUxNSm1fbExGTzF1YXlUVkxXQ1hPcmlZWC1YOWgzVUFzQ1U3R011N2hBTFZ2SExtNklHSG12LUVzeURqV0FjYzVrMWJzUnVhUk93YzlVNDNBZmRCSDBqT3h4VGZxY0JQampnSXM4eEtabUpxMG1hM0xNZjZIQ3Q2YlBOMjE1MGZkcmJ4SDRCR2twQktDTVM0NXEteUtuYy1ROE5QSW5xV1JqR2VsNUEwN3Nv</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，与肺癌驱动DNA突变相关的空气污染-《卫报》 | Air pollution linked to lung cancer-driving DNA mutations, study finds - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOUFJqUEZMVDRyTVVxMm4yZWZJM3JVQ1E0RlZFcDVLVm5JbTd2N0JGWTZGazBjRzkxOFRjdnlNV0JJdkpRV01PeE1kNThBUFQtcmttcHpaLVA3dlgyMkxha3YtZ0xzXzVZdDVmcWhmTlkyWHE5UE93WFpvekFpSWJuRVY4RlVWZjA2NncybUZ1UkNjeC04OEVIQw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Air pollution has been linked to a swathe of lung cancer-driving DNA mutations, in a study of people diagnosed with the disease despite never having smoked tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings from an investigation into cancer patients around the world helps explain why those who have never smoked make up a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/03/lung-cancer-never-smokers-rise-worldwide-air-p" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rising proportion&lt;/a&gt; of people developing the cancer, a trend the researchers called an “urgent and growing global problem”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"science","tags":[{"id":"science/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer research"},{"id":"society/lung-cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Lung cancer"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"environment/air-pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Air pollution"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/iansample","type":"Contributor","title":"Ian Sample","twitterHandle":"iansample","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/11/15/Ian_Sample.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=8e4848b5cd47215a09f2a5d1f2d4dd9d","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/11/15/Ian_Sample,_L.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9455f2ae800441cdaea2f1e216d52ea5"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"science/2025/jul/02/air-pollution-lung-cancer-dna-mutations-study","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Ludmil Alexandrov, a senior author on the study at the University of California in San Diego, said researchers had observed the “problematic trend” but had not understood the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our research shows that air pollution is strongly associated with the same types of DNA mutations we typically associate with smoking,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scientists analysed the entire genetic code of lung tumours removed from 871 never-smokers in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia as part of the &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/lung/sherlock-lung-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Sherlock-Lung study&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the higher the levels of air pollution in a region, the more cancer-driving and cancer-promoting mutations were present in residents’ tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fine-particulate air pollution was in particular linked to mutations in the TP53 gene. These have previously been associated with tobacco smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People exposed to greater air pollution also had shorter telomeres, protective strands of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes, which are often compared with the caps on shoelaces. Premature shortening of telomeres is a sign of more rapid cell division, a hallmark of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is an urgent and growing global problem that we are working to understand,” said Dr Maria Teresa Landi, an epidemiologist on the study at the US National &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With smoking in decline in many parts of the world, including the UK and the US, people who have never smoked are making up a larger proportion of lung cancer patients. Current estimates suggest that 10-25% of lung cancers are now diagnosed in this group. Almost all such cancers are a form known as adenocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 2.5m new cases are diagnosed globally each year. More than a million of the deaths occur in China, where smoking, air pollution and other environmental contaminants are factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/09/air-pollution-causing-lung-cancer-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that the highest rates of adenocarcinoma attributable to air pollution were in east Asia. While cases in the UK were much lower, they still amounted to more than 1,100 new diagnoses a year, scientists found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest work, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09219-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, identified only a slight rise in cancer-causing mutations in people exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the study highlighted a significant risk from certain Chinese herbal medicines that contain aristolochic acid. Signature mutations linked to the herbal medicines were seen almost exclusively in never-smokers from Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another mysterious mutational signature was seen in people who had never smoked but not those who did, and was now the focus of “intense investigation”, Landi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOUFJqUEZMVDRyTVVxMm4yZWZJM3JVQ1E0RlZFcDVLVm5JbTd2N0JGWTZGazBjRzkxOFRjdnlNV0JJdkpRV01PeE1kNThBUFQtcmttcHpaLVA3dlgyMkxha3YtZ0xzXzVZdDVmcWhmTlkyWHE5UE93WFpvekFpSWJuRVY4RlVWZjA2NncybUZ1UkNjeC04OEVIQw</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，关于衰老的常见假设可能是错误的-独立报 | New study suggests common assumption about aging could be wrong - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPM1ZmcFNILWgxNGZiNUNnRm9mRGFkSXJIYWRGRkNhOWt6cHd4YnZFQ1ZxNmo5M0c1VlRVOTNmVmRVTDJoTW44SnlIY2tKeUMxUURKZjF5QlpLMjA2UHRsel9USl9OVEtGSTNqc0lQQzJxdU5XU1hXSWd2SExtWTg0WHNIVXV1M2ZfeFNqRkJ4b1J2bkM2Y1NNZmVpMHYwX0dHSFJXY01zVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Inflammation protects the body from injury or infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is thought to speed up the ageing process and contribute to various health conditions such as &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/alzheimers-dementia-research-protein-ptau217-b2780235.html"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;disease, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/arthritis-flare-up-symptoms-advice-summer-b2770041.html"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/bulletin/lifestyle/alcohol-smoking-overweight-early-death-b2778438.html"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6146930/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Researchers have long believed that most older people will suffer from inflammageing as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the study, published in Nature Age this week, found that people in nonindustrialized areas experience inflammation differently than those in urban areas and there may be another cause behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers&lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nature.com%252Farticles%252Fs43587-025-00888-0%26sref%3D%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammation-aging-cause-study-common-assumption-b2781348.html&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammation-aging-cause-study-common-assumption-b2781348.html&amp;amp;article_id=2781348&amp;amp;author=Madeline+Sherratt&amp;amp;tag=Inflammation%2Caging%2CHeart+Disease%2CBiology%2CType+2+diabetes&amp;amp;section=Health&amp;amp;category=N%2FA&amp;amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;amp;updated_time=2025-07-02T16%3A24%3A03.000Z&amp;amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=N%2FA&amp;amp;ref=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;amp;gclid=N%2FA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared the lives of two indigenous, nonindustrialized populations - the Tsimane from the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli from Peninsular Malaysia - with two groups from Italy and Singapore. Researchers compared blood samples from about 2,800 adults between 18 and 95 in the four groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that chronic inflammation may not be linked explicitly to ageing, but rather that diet, lifestyle and environmental factors are more significant factors than previously thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that inflammation in the nonindustrialized groups did not appear to increase as subjects got older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Cohen, associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University and co-author of the study, said the findings suggest inflammation is “more complex than we currently understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gWMNUM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24695"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Tsimane and Orang Asli differ from us in all these ways,” he told The Independent. “The insight of our study is not to say we need to be more active, but to challenge the idea that we understand biology well and can micromanage it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s a warning – don’t follow the latest trends of eating foods specifically to reduce inflammation, or whatever else the trend of the week may be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other experts shared a word of caution before jumping to conclusions from the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vishwa Deep Dixit, director of the Yale Center for Research on Aging, told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; it’s not surprising that people less exposed to pollution would see lower rates of chronic disease. The findings should lead to valuable discussion but would need further study “before we rewrite the inflammaging narrative,” professor of pharmacology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine Bimal Desai added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPM1ZmcFNILWgxNGZiNUNnRm9mRGFkSXJIYWRGRkNhOWt6cHd4YnZFQ1ZxNmo5M0c1VlRVOTNmVmRVTDJoTW44SnlIY2tKeUMxUURKZjF5QlpLMjA2UHRsel9USl9OVEtGSTNqc0lQQzJxdU5XU1hXSWd2SExtWTg0WHNIVXV1M2ZfeFNqRkJ4b1J2bkM2Y1NNZmVpMHYwX0dHSFJXY01zVQ</guid></item><item><title>根据新的研究，加工肉类没有安全的食用量- CNN | There is no safe amount of processed meat to eat, according to new research - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOTTNIempGeWhyQmZkNElDbWZWTENUbGU2bDJQVmVnZ280ZTdIOFNXalhKa2NRQVpXY3RSM1F4YWNqUVJTWmctRFNqQURlS0JKbnprRlJiSDNiLTk4WlRCTXl3ZzFJME9pZmlmQl81bUV2QVFsVFB4SDlBRmVtUmhhV0pEaElHeVJweGFF0gGQAUFVX3lxTE9XSWxVVXdFLWlyTl9MSHJHVHI1UHRFd0FXNlVBajVoV19ubzNVME9zQ2dEWVRwdkhaVDBQYk91LTF0TWFaSlY3eUh4RDNjb3VDdUpXOHpKclJlc1poRlNYY2ItSGNSVU5NYTVlaURwc1kyTnZkazYxWmpDTi0wd1ZIbTBzRmRQZjZFYnVuREpBLQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3gdkm004k26p38veba25i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is strong evidence that there is “no safe amount” of processed meat to eat, nutrition experts say in response to a new study on the connection between diet and the risk of major diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The researchers also found elevated risks from the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjg00043b6mujuyn2nb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed data from more than 60 previous studies on the relationship between processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids in a person’s diet and their risk of type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and ischemic heart disease, which reduces blood supply to the heart and cuts off oxygen and nutrients, according to the study published Monday in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8#author-information" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00053b6moenjnd9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease and colorectal cancer,” said lead author of the study, Dr. Demewoz Haile, a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00063b6mmb5ywymh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data showed that people who ate as little as one hot dog a day when it comes to processed meats had an 11% greater risk of type 2 diabetes and a 7% increased risk of colorectal cancer than those who didn’t eat any. And drinking the equivalent of about a 12-ounce soda per day was associated with an 8% increase in type 2 diabetes risk and a 2% increased risk of ischemic heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00073b6mw9snhzpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This current research has shown, yet again and consistent with prior research … that to achieve health gains it is best to avoid or minimize the habitual consumption of each of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs),” said Dr. Nita Forouhi, head of nutritional epidemiology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00083b6moof2nam0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The risk increased as consumption increased; and for processed meat consumption, the data showed that there is no “safe amount,” she added in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00093b6m1rl5pv0m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first glance, the increase in risk seems modest and might look like the association is weak, said Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan Schoo of Public Healthl. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000a3b6m6hy79tqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we look at the actual data there, it’s really remarkably consistent and remarkably strong, and even in the lower dose of consumption, we can still see an increased risk of disease,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000b3b6mzfo2qee4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers examined dozens of earlier findings on diet and disease using a burden-of-proof method: a newer form of meta-analysis that not only tries to quantify an association across multiple studies but also accounts for the quality of each, Song said. “One caveat is it tends to give very conservative results,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000c3b6ms2vpk3wr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to note that the studies included in the analysis were observational, meaning that the data can only show an association between eating habits and disease –– not prove that what people ate caused the disease. They also relied on people recalling their dietary patterns, which can leave room for misremembering or misreporting, said Dr. Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000d3b6m4eo4udq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Utilizing even “the most sophisticated techniques does not really solve the problem that the information about diet is rather limited – which is obviously a big problem in nutritional epidemiology in general,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3hc1r000q3b6mm6tbqpos@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="why-meats-drinks-and-fats-are-linked-to-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Why meats, drinks and fats are linked to disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000e3b6m9kvq8fri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are many reasons why such foods could be associated with health problems. Sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meat –– such as sausages, bacon, salami and burgers –– can increase inflammation, which plays a big part in a variety of chronic diseases, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000f3b6mydnu1r33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Processed meats are also often cured with nitrite, which is converted to carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000g3b6mvi3tgb79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The problem with sugary drinks is that they are a quick way to consume large amounts of sugar, he added. Not only can that cause weight gain, but it also influences metabolic pathways that affect heart disease and diabetes risk, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000h3b6mwi2auqye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trans fatty acids reduce levels of good cholesterol and increase the bad, which is known to increase the risk of plaque buildup in arteries and heart disease, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000i3b6moz0ld5ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other potential connections to consider  are that people who are more likely to eat processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans-fats are often also at a higher risk of diseases because of “lifestyle factors (smoking, lack of exercise), but also social factors such as education and income, chronic stress and limited access to health care,” Kuhnle said. “It is very difficult to take these apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3hc2b000r3b6m32remwn2@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-to-avoid-and-what-to-add" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What to avoid and what to add
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000j3b6mcciskhye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the data can’t say reducing your consumption of these foods and drinks will cause a lower risk of the diseases, it does suggest that a reduction is a good idea, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000k3b6mulgciljj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sensible approach is to follow a varied and balanced diet that avoids excess, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000l3b6mc7j05o4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means people who drink a lot of sugary drinks should cut back, he said. It can also be helpful to avoid excess amounts of processed meats and avoid hydrogenated fats where possible –– although they are no longer as common as they used to be, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000m3b6m9mpbsly2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal shouldn’t be perfection but rather a healthy and sensible dietary pattern that allows room for enjoyment,” Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000n3b6mtnr95goq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A good diet isn’t just about what to avoid. It’s also important to get good nutrients, Forouhi said. “Wider research has shown us that overall dietary patterns that include higher consumption of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and fermented dairy products like yogurt are good for health and longevity,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000o3b6m5bi90768@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My general advice: don’t panic,” Kuhnle said in an email. “Food is not just (a)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;source of nutrients –– it plays a central role in culture, pleasure, family life, and social connection. Reducing it solely to a list of health risks misses the bigger picture.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

They include medications like citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), and fluoxetine (Prozac), and millions of people take them every year in the U.S. While having extra serotonin floating around in your system — and thereby boosting your mood — is the primary effect of taking an SSRI, one potential side effect is that some of them might impact the system that the body uses to regulate temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ERBUPAZVDRFLVESMLTRZETVZTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“SSRIs are known to make people — not everybody — sweat excessively,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/gerard-sanacora/" target="_blank"&gt;Gerard Sanacora&lt;/a&gt;, professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine. “And in those people, there’s always the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/12/06/eight-cups-daily-water-intake/" target="_blank"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt;, especially on very hot days.” One 2005 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3931183/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that up to 20 percent of SSRI users might experience excessive sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FY5P47C2AZAKRNYYF44UUZRFMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s how SSRIs affect the body, especially when it’s hot outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QRVXSDRWW5FE7AQAZLLRWBMMMM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QRVXSDRWW5FE7AQAZLLRWBMMMM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The ways SSRIs impact your body in the heat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IW4YM7UPGZCYPP4B44M4AWVKHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;SSRIs can impact the function of the hypothalamus, a part of the brain responsible for temperature regulation, said &lt;a href="https://www.bmc.org/about-us/directory/doctor/christine-m-crawford-md-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Christine M. Crawford,&lt;/a&gt; a psychiatrist with Boston Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CAQ4SPYPPBD67L42HHA2JH5L6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“When people are sensitive to any changes in levels of serotonin, their hypothalamus responds differently,” she noted, adding that these mechanisms are also responsible for helping to cool a person’s body through sweat and vasodilation, a.k.a. the widening of blood vessels to boost blood flow. “So when that is altered, they just feel hotter,” Crawford explains. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/10/night-sweats-sleep-causes-treatment/" target="_blank"&gt;Night sweats&lt;/a&gt; also tend to be a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4883206/" target="_blank"&gt;common complaint&lt;/a&gt; among SSRI users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q77QY6KXSZG7DKG6J7DFQ3IR2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An SSRI might cause someone to become excessively sweaty or even perspire &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt;, which can be dangerous if the body can’t cool itself down with sweat and overheats. “It really depends on the individual,” Sanacora notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BCDR7JYI7JCHPFY4ZLEWIRYKFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/john-krystal" target="_blank"&gt;John Krystal&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, said in an email that some tricyclic antidepressants — another type of medication used to treat depression — can block certain brain receptors that help with sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5LD4B2PQQ5FP5BW6CZSBRKFAGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it’s not just antidepressants, Crawford said. Beta blockers, antihistamines, and even pain meds like acetaminophen, aspirin, and NSAIDs, can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/hcp/clinical-guidance/heat-and-medications-guidance-for-clinicians.html" target="_blank"&gt;cause heat intolerance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6FOLWHD4HJC3DCVTBOLKMZX36I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6FOLWHD4HJC3DCVTBOLKMZX36I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to stay safe in hot temps, on antidepressants or not&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VWJSJDTLBHQXGPORHR7ULIAAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No matter what the weather forecast looks like, don’t stop taking an SSRI&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;without the help of a health care provider&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E2QLZWDCDZF7NFAROVHJPVL5AE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You don’t want to stop treatment and then have more severe symptoms that could potentially lead to a mental health crisis,” Sanacora explained, adding that abruptly stopping an SSRI can make you feel even hotter than you might’ve felt while taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PFUARQJSBRCW3IWFJCBANSQGKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here are a few tips to keep safe in hot temperatures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ol class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="UGWV75TUHNAZXD2AK3HBI3A3XY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Talk to your health care provider. &lt;/b&gt;If you think your medication is making you excessively sweaty or uncomfortable in the heat, call your doctor, Sanacora said. They can potentially put you on a different medication or help you find another solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit your exposure on particularly sweltering days. &lt;/b&gt;“Try to stay out of the excessively hot weather if possible, and especially high humidity,” Sanacora said. “That combination of high temperature, high humidity makes it very hard to cool the body temperature.” If you have to be out when temps soar, try to take breaks in indoor malls, libraries, or any public air-conditioned facility. Here’s how to &lt;a href="https://nchh.org/information-and-evidence/learn-about-healthy-housing/emergencies/extreme-heat/cooling-centers-by-state/" target="_blank"&gt;find a local cooling center near you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay hydrated. &lt;/b&gt;Sanacora recommends keeping up on your fluid intake throughout the day — so your urine stays a pale yellow — and add in electrolytes if you’re going to be in excessive heat for long periods of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dress appropriately.&lt;/b&gt; “Wear clothes that can wick,” Sanacora said, adding that our body cools itself when sweat evaporates properly, so if perspiration is stuck to your skin (especially if you’re sweating more on an SSRI), you could feel a lot more uncomfortable. Opt for natural vs. synthetic fibers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let go of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;looking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; cool in favor of actually being cool. &lt;/b&gt;Crawford recommends a mini fan around your neck on hot days. You could even opt for a sun-shielding umbrella. (I’m a huge fan of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FROGG-TOGGS-Instant-reusable-Outdoors/dp/B002NGSB96/ref=sr_1_11?crid=1XTXP8YG4TGWN&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.J2ojeV8X-t8DYPG4I2GC0p5WITirGCNtb0NufXg7V-eE1GJ246ySze3bChPSHcdiEfT7Xkys9VqagiiLJ_7Hc4YeaVvlpuTLJ2sb76eDcmIyvuQFzbJ_W0yk57P4FXVnQGrQZVH98_-F77Fs4J_NPLTwj4GYISye61s9QO-OQ_X3RyZAYa6lcvnjoO3e_nmqn1cZrMJzZz2n_mIMEejP8qGDoSGTEkVi9X14tudOiMkk7snjf4bDbT6TWZmG4i9N_OphQTVtkj2W9-lCm6iCIcCROfpLuzYTPVLmqGtqutw.AH0GMOWHc3FIN54vD8yinqGLPgmpF2e7BZvR_gz06a4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=cooling+towel&amp;amp;qid=1750971843&amp;amp;sprefix=cooling+towel+amazon%2Caps%2C432&amp;amp;sr=8-11" target="_blank"&gt;cooling towels&lt;/a&gt;, which helped me survive a recent rim-to-rim Grand Canyon hike.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Know the signs of heat exhaustion. &lt;/b&gt;This includes dizziness, headache, nausea, reduced urine output, and an elevated body temperature. “If these signs are present, it is important to take steps to cool off before more serious complications of overheating emerge, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/06/heatstroke-exercise-brain-hot-weather/" target="_blank"&gt;heatstroke&lt;/a&gt;, which is characterized by confusion, excessive sweating or hot skin, but can progress to loss of consciousness, and seizures,” Krystal said. If your core body temp rises to 104 degrees (which can happen with heatstroke), it can damage the kidneys, brain, heart, and muscles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep your room cool at night&lt;/b&gt;. If you’re prone to night sweats, it’s extra important to stay hydrated throughout the day. Try to keep your bedroom as cool as possible — somewhere between 60 and 68 degrees — and crank a nearby fan on high. Avoid memory foam mattresses, as those can trap heat. As for sheets, skip satin and wool materials, and invest in linen over cotton. While linen can be expensive, it might be worth it if you are perspiring through your bedding. FYI: Night sweats can also be indicative of underlying hormonal shifts, like menopause and perimenopause, so talk with your doctor regardless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6HUNYI76LBA2NF3ZNVOG5GB4MA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While you may be at a slightly higher risk for heat-related illnesses, that shouldn’t deter you from getting on, or continuing, an antidepressant if you need one, Sanacora said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KZ66DK52VNFVDKASU7ZRFCWJHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You have to be really careful in excessively hot weather, regardless of whether you’re on an SSRI or not,” Sanacora said. “But you may want to even be a little bit extra careful if you are taking an SSRI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:02:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBvZUt3ODNZVGZySUlmWHhDMEY2bGI1VHA0NTB0VVlhQUtfVUZnc21jelAzN1dXNmxpM2lpdG82X2trSkw4aGF0dExUU3RnLWwwaWp3UzVjbVV2di0tUHdGQW5mLXVDZ25TV0pvQ0RXV2Z5cnEwVkRIVWxSM0d3UQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现运动Lifehack ：上床睡觉- Gizmodo | Scientists Uncover Exercise Lifehack: Go to Bed - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPMFJYTHVKbkpCSGQzTlhNV0F2dUc2M19Xd3pFbktaUEE3U19fUWU4V0FYdnNLbGhOWUFIbmotWTdaMTRQRWdRdEhQdGNLTlBCNllsYm9EbTdleFBwNjFSQUozYjFZWHZ4clVxMlJIRFdZM1d5c3R3aVR3b29CaDJ1OTFocw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;As if you needed another reason to envy—or loathe—morning people. Research this week shows that people who go to bed early are more likely to be physically active than those who crave the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Monash University in Australia led the study, which objectively examined people’s sleeping and exercise habits. Compared to late-night and typical sleepers, people who went to bed early tended to perform more physical activity the following day, they found. The findings also suggest that tweaking our bedtimes can indirectly help us stay more active, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Going to sleep earlier than usual may be an effective strategy to maintain normal sleep duration while also optimizing next-day [physical activity],” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2420846122"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regularly getting a good night’s sleep and exercising are both vital keys to better overall health. But according to the researchers, it’s still unclear exactly how these two aspects of our lives can interact with each other. The team was particularly interested in finding out whether the timing of people’s sleep can affect their exercise time, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They analyzed data from two earlier studies that tracked people’s waking and non-waking activity via wearables. In the first study, roughly 20,000 participants wore an activity tracker for an entire year, meaning the researchers had data covering roughly six million nights of sleeping. Across the whole sample, people’s average bedtime was around 11 p.m. Early sleepers were classified as people who turned in for bed around 9 p.m., whereas late sleepers went to bed around 1 a.m.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to late sleepers, early birds clocked 30 more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on average, the researchers found; they also exercised about 15 minutes more than the typical sleeper. These patterns remained stable when the researchers analyzed data from the second study that involved almost 6,000 people who wore FitBits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the study isn’t intended to answer why night owls might exercise less, the researchers have their educated guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Standard 9-to-5 routines can clash with the natural sleep preferences of evening types, leading to social jetlag, poorer sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness—which can all reduce motivation and opportunity for physical activity the next day,” said lead author Josh Leota, a scientist at Monash’s Sleep and Circadian Rhythms research program, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1089146"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our sleeping habits are influenced by many factors that aren’t easily adjusted, including the hours we work and our genetics. But there might be some hope for late birds who would like to exercise more. The researchers also found that people who slept earlier than their typical time, while still sleeping the same amount of hours as usual, tended to perform more physical activity the next day. In other words, it should be possible to work on our sleep and get more workout time all at once. And the researchers say that public health groups should try to emphasize both if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Rather than just promoting sleep and physical activity independently, health campaigns could encourage earlier bedtimes to naturally foster more active lifestyles. A holistic approach that recognizes how these two essential behaviors interact may lead to better outcomes for individual and community health,” said Leota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m all for getting more beauty rest and gym time. But I will draw the line at 5 a.m. morning runs, just FYI.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten weeks after a New England man received a kidney transplant, he went into respiratory failure and shock — thanks to an extensive parasitic worm infection, according to his medical team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 61-year-old man &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510?logout=true" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;received a new kidney from a deceased donor&lt;/a&gt; after being diagnosed with “nephrosclerosis-related end-stage kidney disease,” or chronic high blood pressure that causes hardening of the walls of arteries in the kidneys, according to a June 18 case report published in the Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transplant was successful and the man was sent home with care instructions just four days later, doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six weeks later, the man attended a follow-up visit where doctors saw a slightly elevated creatinine level and hyperglycemia, the former an indicator of kidney function and the latter indicative of diabetes, according to the report. He was sent home with a weekly injection of semaglutide, the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then his health took a turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Successful transplant turns critical&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later, the 61-year-old was scratched by his cat and his ankle began to swell, doctors said. He started to feel tired and nauseated the next week, then started throwing up and drinking excessive amounts of water, according to the case report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was admitted to the hospital again, and over the next ten days, his heart rate increased significantly, his breathing decreased until he needed to be put on a ventilator, doctors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoping for answers, his medical team turned to his previous medical history for something that might have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 61-year-old had been on the transplant list for 6 years, according to the report, and he had diabetes and spent much of his life as a smoker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had lived in New England his entire life and hadn’t traveled. He enjoyed gardening, and had healthy cats and a dog at home with his wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the rash appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purple and blotchy, the rash stretched across his stomach as his abdomen grew to become large and hard, and normal bowel sounds were absent, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this point, the man was described as “critically ill,” and because the man was on immunodepressants to help his body transition to the new organ, doctors compared the man’s symptoms to other examples of infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="13" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that the patient’s presentation is not consistent with a drug reaction or rejection of the kidney allograft, I think that the most likely explanation for his critical illness is a disseminated parasitic infection,” Camille N. Kotton, an &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/1248022/Camille-Kotton" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;infectious disease and transplant expert&lt;/a&gt;, wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was diagnosed with “donor-derived disseminated strongyloidiasis,” or an infection caused by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;parasitic roundworms,&lt;/a&gt; doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are roundworms?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;            &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_1140/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_960/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_768/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_640/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_480/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_1140/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" alt="Strongyloides are a parasitic roundworm and were spread to the man through a donated kidney." title="GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                            &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Strongyloides are a parasitic roundworm and were spread to the man through a donated kidney.                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStock Photo&lt;/span&gt;                                                            &lt;/figcaption&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roundworms, also called threadworms, can infect humans directly, but can also be passed to humans through contact with monkeys or domestic dogs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this man’s case, the source of the infection was his new kidney, donated from someone who lived in the Caribbean before their death and who had not been tested for strongyloides before the donation, according to the case report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2017, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, the group that oversees organ donation in the United States, reported 14 out of 10,000 organ donations could result in disease transmission, or about 0.14% of donations, doctors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="20" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, many of these events are varied and unexpected, involving a long list of pathogens ranging from viruses to bacteria and parasites,” doctors wrote. “Although we have contemplated how to avoid such transmissions, many seem unavoidable and result in undesirable circumstances.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was successfully treated with ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, and doctors contacted the organ board to see if any other patients had received organs from the same donor, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 66-year-old man had received the donor’s other kidney, doctors said, and his medical team was contacted to begin treatment for the infection after he had already been showing similar symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-109" class="zone zone-el" index="23" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men fully recovered and their transplants were successful, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team includes Kotton, Rory L.

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 &lt;strong&gt;StateViewer&lt;/strong&gt; is a cutting-edge AI tool developed by Mayo Clinic, capable of diagnosing nine types of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📈 The tool analyzes &lt;strong&gt;FDG-PET scans&lt;/strong&gt; and provides color-coded brain maps for easy interpretation by clinicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌍 With a global dementia burden affecting over &lt;strong&gt;55 million people&lt;/strong&gt;, StateViewer offers a scalable diagnostic solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 The tool boasts an impressive &lt;strong&gt;88% accuracy rate&lt;/strong&gt; and significantly improves diagnostic speed and precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, Mayo Clinic researchers have unveiled an innovative AI tool called &lt;strong&gt;StateViewer&lt;/strong&gt;, capable of diagnosing nine types of dementia using just one common brain scan. This technological marvel promises to revolutionize dementia diagnosis by providing faster and more accurate results than traditional methods. The significance of this tool lies in its potential to transform how clinicians approach dementia, offering hope for millions affected by these debilitating conditions. By leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms, StateViewer stands at the forefront of medical technology, paving the way for a future where early and precise diagnosis is within reach for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding StateViewer’s Advanced Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StateViewer tool operates by analyzing a &lt;strong&gt;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan&lt;/strong&gt;, which highlights how the brain utilizes glucose—a critical marker of brain activity. By comparing these scans to an extensive database of confirmed dementia cases, the AI can identify distinct patterns associated with various dementia types. For example, &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt; affects memory and cognitive processing areas, while &lt;strong&gt;Lewy body dementia&lt;/strong&gt; targets regions involved in attention and motor functions. &lt;strong&gt;Frontotemporal dementia&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, impacts language and behavior-related areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StateViewer presents its findings through &lt;i&gt;color-coded brain maps&lt;/i&gt;, enabling even general clinicians to grasp complex dementia patterns visually. Dr. David Jones, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic, emphasized the tool’s capacity to simplify the diagnostic process, allowing for more informed treatment decisions. “Every patient who walks into my clinic carries a unique story shaped by the brain’s complexity,” Dr. Jones noted, underscoring the tool’s potential to transform patient care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KUJUjaTrWl"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/samsung-faces-a-shocking-setback-latest-smartphone-flops-so-hard-the-brand-is-forced-to-rethink-its-entire-strategy/"&gt;“Samsung Faces a Shocking Setback”: Latest Smartphone Flops So Hard the Brand Is Forced to Rethink Its Entire Strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tackling the Growing Dementia Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over &lt;strong&gt;55 million people worldwide&lt;/strong&gt; living with dementia and 10 million new cases annually, the burden of this condition is immense. Alzheimer’s disease alone ranks as the fifth-leading cause of death globally. Traditional diagnostic methods for dementia involve a battery of tests, including cognitive assessments, imaging, and consultations, making the process arduous and time-consuming. Despite these efforts, accurately distinguishing between overlapping dementia types remains challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jones, in collaboration with AI engineer Leland Barnard, recognized the urgent need for a more efficient diagnostic tool. “As we were designing StateViewer, we never lost sight of the fact that behind every data point and brain scan was a person facing a difficult diagnosis and urgent questions,” Barnard reflected. Their work highlights the critical role machine learning can play in enhancing clinical medicine by providing real-time insights and guidance to physicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HZHC3M31Ua"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/canada-unleashes-tech-superpower-new-mega-hub-fuses-ai-quantum-computing-and-gpus-to-redefine-global-innovation/"&gt;“Canada Unleashes Tech Superpower”: New Mega Hub Fuses AI, Quantum Computing, and GPUs to Redefine Global Innovation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Potential of StateViewer in Clinical Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StateViewer’s introduction marks a significant step forward in the fight against dementia, offering a scalable solution that could democratize expert-level diagnostic support. The technology has been rigorously tested across &lt;strong&gt;3,600 brain scans&lt;/strong&gt;, demonstrating an impressive 88% accuracy rate in identifying the correct type of dementia. This represents a threefold increase in diagnostic accuracy compared to standard workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers are optimistic about expanding StateViewer’s use across diverse clinical environments. By doing so, they hope to facilitate earlier interventions and improve patient outcomes significantly. The tool’s success in various settings could redefine the treatment landscape for dementia, providing a model for integrating AI into everyday clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pthta2TRwJ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/robot-destroys-world-record-by-solving-rubiks-cube-faster-than-a-blink-leaving-even-experts-in-total-disbelief/"&gt;Robot Destroys World Record by Solving Rubik’s Cube Faster Than a Blink, Leaving Even Experts in Total Disbelief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking to the Future of Dementia Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As StateViewer continues to evolve, its potential impact on healthcare is profound. By enabling quicker and more precise diagnoses, the tool offers hope for earlier intervention and treatment, potentially altering the progression of these diseases. The study’s publication in the journal &lt;strong&gt;Neurology&lt;/strong&gt; underscores the tool’s scientific credibility and its promise in reshaping dementia care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new treatments for dementia emerge, tools like StateViewer will be crucial in ensuring timely and accurate diagnoses. This innovation raises an important question: &lt;i&gt;How will AI-driven diagnostics reshape our approach to complex medical conditions in the years to come?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;h1&gt;NIH study links particulate air pollution to increased mutations in lung cancers among nonsmokers&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;Whole-genome sequencing study found air pollution to cause more cancer-related changes than secondhand smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, have found that fine-particulate air pollution, which includes pollution from vehicles and industry, was strongly associated with increased genomic changes in lung cancer tumors among people who have never smoked. By assembling the largest-ever whole-genome analysis of lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked, researchers were able to link air pollution exposure to increased cancer-driving and cancer-promoting genetic mutations. This could potentially lead to more prevention strategies for never-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed lung tumors from 871 never-smoker patients across 28 geographic locations worldwide as part of the &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/lung/sherlock-lung-study"&gt;Sherlock-Lung study&lt;/a&gt;. They found associations between air pollution exposure and changes in the &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt; gene, and other genetic mutational signatures previously associated with tobacco smoking. They also observed a relationship between air pollution and shorter telomeres, which are sections of DNA found at the end of chromosomes. Telomeres shorten naturally with age and shorter telomeres are related to cells inability to continue to replicate. However, scientists found fine particulate air pollution was linked to premature shortening of telomeres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior genomic studies of lung cancer have focused on tobacco smokers, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of how lung cancer develops in people who have never used tobacco. By beginning to uncover the mechanisms through which tissues acquire cancer-causing or cancer-promoting mutations following environmental exposures, this study helps scientists better understand the primary drivers of lung cancer in this population—which represents up to 25% of all lung cancer cases globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found that while exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with slightly higher mutation burdens and shorter telomeres, compared to tumors in patients who were not exposed, it did not lead to an increase in cancer-driving mutations or mutational signatures. This suggests that secondhand smoke may have a lower overall ability to cause genetic mutations, known as mutagenicity, compared to air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was led by researchers at NIH’s National Cancer Institute and the University of California, San Diego, and published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on July 2, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

It is triggered when a person is bitten by a tick - most commonly the lone star tick - that carries the alpha-gal sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the tick bites someone it injects the sugar into the person's body and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14516809/Woman-hospitalized-mystery-illness-caused-red-meat-millions-risk.html"&gt;causes the immune system to develop antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that attack it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alpha-gal molecules are also found in the meat of most mammals, including pork, beef, venison and other red meats, as well as milk, gelatin or other animal products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a person eats these foods, the body detects the alpha-gal and attacks it. This immune response can lead to a life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-14e18a00-5754-11f0-b5ba-ad528d110626"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 110,000 cases have been documented since 2010, but because of underreporting or misdiagnoses, the true number could be as high as 450,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And numbers are growing, experts warn, as temperatures rise and ticks survive milder winters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have said they are not aware of any confirmed deaths from AGS, but there is a risk if the allergic reaction becomes severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) is triggered when a person is bitten by a tick - most commonly the lone star tick (pictured above) - that carries the alpha-gal sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brandon Hollingsworth, a tick expert at the University of South Carolina, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/29/lone-star-ticks-increase-climate-crisis"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;The Guardian: 'We thought this thing was relatively rare 10 years ago but it’s become more and more common and it’s something I expect to continue to grow very rapidly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases have been predominantly in southern, midwestern and mid-Atlantic regions of the US, but recent testing on human and tick samples suggests millions more Americans could be at risk because the tick that causes AGS is spreading to new geographical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, it's been found the condition is increasingly being passed on to humans by new species of ticks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laura Harrington, a disease specialist at Cornell, added: ‘With their adaptive nature and increasing temperatures, I don’t see many limits to these ticks over time.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Allergen Insider, symptoms not only come from eating red meat but in more severe cases people reported that they experienced symptoms after just inhaling fumes of mammalian meat being cooked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AGS may not show symptoms immediately, which is why it is difficult to link the allergy to a tick bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After consuming meat it can be between two to six hours before any symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And they can vary widely, including hives or an itchy rash, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, diarrhea, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, dizziness, stomach pain and swelling of the lips, throat, tongue, or eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Lone Star Tick bite is largely responsible for the condition, and can be found in the southeastern US, but they are slowly spreading north with rising temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent case study, a 61-year-old woman experienced two major allergic reactions brought on by Alpha-Gal Syndrome after eating beef and pork tacos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During her first experience, 29 days after a tick bite, she developed hives and swelling but her mild symptoms resolved with over-the-counter allergy medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But during her second episode a month later, her tongue swelled so much that she could not speak and was rushed to the hospital, as her blood pressure dropped dangerously low and heart rate increased rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases have been predominantly in southern, midwestern and mid-Atlantic regions of the US, but millions more could be at risk because the tick that causes AGS is spreading to new areas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was given epinephrine - the typical treatment for allergic reactions - but her symptoms worsened and her throat began to close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman was then given steroids and by the time she arrived at the hospital her condition began to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she originally reported no significant event preceding either allergic reaction, in later interviews she said about a month before the first episode she had been bitten by a tick and was treated with an antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prevent AGS, experts recommend checking for ticks after spending time outdoors. If you discover a tick bite, quickly remove the tick, disinfect the area, and monitor yourself for symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also stress the importance of increased surveillance of AGS and the types of ticks people acquire the condition from as ticks and states that historically have not posed the risk of AGS are increasingly being traced as the source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hollingsworth said: 'We’ve seen an explosive increase in these ticks, which is a concern. I imagine alpha-gal will soon include the entire range of the tick, which could become the entire eastern half of the US as there’s not much to stop them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It seems like an oddity now but we could end up with millions of people with an allergy to meat.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(Image provided by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;An Alaska woman has died from a severe complication of gonorrhea that is rare but has increased in frequency in the state, health officials reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The woman, in her 50s, had &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Disseminated-Gonococcal-Infection.aspx" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;disseminated gonococcal infection&lt;/a&gt;, or DGI, in which the bacteria that causes gonorrhea spreads to organs, according to a &lt;a href="https://epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/b2025_13.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;bulletin&lt;/a&gt; issued Monday by the Department of Health’s epidemiology section. She arrived in the spring at the emergency department of an Anchorage hospital with septic shock and heart failure, and the DGI diagnosis followed before she died, the bulletin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She was one of eight Alaskans identified with DGI between January and May of this year, according to the bulletin. Patients ranged in age from 32 to 59. Five were women. All were treated in Anchorage, according to the bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The woman who died had been treated twice in the prior six months for opioid abuse, but there was no record of her being tested for gonorrhea in the year prior to her death, the bulletin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While gonorrhea is curable with antibiotics, some infected people may have no symptoms and therefore miss testing and treatment, said Dr. Liz Ohlsen, a staff physician with the Alaska Department of Health who authored the bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That puts those people at risk that their untreated gonorrhea will develop into much more serious DGI, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As state health officials track DGI cases, there are concerns that a particular strain may be circulating in Alaska that is less likely to cause symptoms, Ohlsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We think the most likely explanation for the rise in DGI cases is that more people with gonorrhea are not getting tested and treated in a timely manner. Asymptomatic infections are thought to pose a greater risk of persistent untreated infection because people are less likely to have sought care,” she said by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Through a public-education effort, the department is urging Alaskans with multiple sexual partners — or anyone who has a partner with multiple partners — to be tested for gonorrhea regularly, every three to six months, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Alaska has consistently had among the nation’s highest rates of gonorrhea and other sexually transmitted infections. Last year, the state recorded a &lt;a href="https://epi.alaska.gov/bulletins/docs/b2025_13.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;spike&lt;/a&gt; in DGI, with 27 cases reported in 2024 after having had three in 2022 and eight in 2023. That represented 1.3% of total reported gonorrhea cases in 2024, a much higher percentage than what has been reported in earlier years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In cases of DGI, the gonorrheal infections that are normally confined to mucus membranes of the genital, rectal or mouth areas spread internally. Potential effects include joint or tendon problems, heart infections and meningitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Deaths from disseminated gonococcal infection are rare, but DGI can cause serious complications like heart problems that can lead to death. The more cases of DGI we have, the more likely it is that some people have serious complications or death as a result,” Ohlsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Statistics about DGI and DGI-related deaths are difficult to pinpoint, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;While diagnosed cases of gonorrhea are required to be reported in Alaska, as in other states, cases of DGI are not, Ohlsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There are a few available studies that give some information about DGI occurrences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/76/2/194/6746983?login=false#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;study from California&lt;/a&gt; found that from mid-2020 to mid-2021, 0.24% of reported gonorrhea cases had developed into DGI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9751791/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;study of cases&lt;/a&gt; in several Western U.S. states found that of 274 confirmed and probable DGI cases reported between 2020 and 2022 to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2.2% of the patients died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Originally published by the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alaska Beacon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, an independent, nonpartisan news organization that covers Alaska state government.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Anchorage Daily News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 15:00:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNczBRXzJpMm9NREtOcTRKY09xbVpubWRoNjFHWHZvSGUwdmExam10aWVhdUJmSVE4M3Y3ZUUwYXA4Qks2NmVrTUJKaTE1S3Y3UTFrNzFxWWM2SmlqWWVPa0JLdnlKMWl3NjRISEZNZFJWMEw5eWllOE9COHJBdVZ2Yld3VFJvcTl4QURuaktnSkN6bW03dlFSbTBkMTRvb1BvaUNkTTNfWmpmVEVRc0Zr</guid></item><item><title>如果政府停止推荐儿童疫苗，保险公司不会说他们是否会为儿童提供疫苗保险- WIRED | Insurers Aren’t Saying Whether They’ll Cover Vaccines for Kids if Government Stops Recommending Them - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxPQVBkZjZEd3dMem1aM21pSXdMeXNzY094NmdrVDNhZ2tKa0x4RHpNdjhGQ1ZxMEhqZGNIdkJKT3hMZWhvTjJhYzVobWJUZWtDdmZTS1RWVFl6N0R3TGFIWU9FOWpudktRa2lxR3FWcjdFY0xZTEtaY1U5TUpwbTZGYWRZbS10TENHd2VXQ2JUVlRrR0FuV3pnWVAzZHJOX0J2WGdGVThoVExLNm9HNEt1eHRJNV9WTEtG?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We are committed to ongoing coverage of vaccines to ensure access and affordability for this respiratory virus season,” the statement continued. “We encourage all Americans to talk to their health care provider about vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;ACIP made headlines in early June when RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all 17 of its members and replaced them with &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1932899858920120692" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1932899858920120692"}' href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1932899858920120692" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight&lt;/a&gt; new appointees.

Ross did not reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The committee made news again on June 25 when, during its first &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/presentation-slides-june-25-26-2025.html"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the year, it announced it would form a working group to review the recommended immunization schedule for children and teens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“The number of vaccines that our children and adolescents receive today exceed what children in most other developed nations receive, and what most of us in this room received when we [were] children,” ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/2PnYYb_xj3U"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;He noted that the group would examine the “cumulative effect” of the recommended vaccine schedule, including interactions between vaccines, the total number of vaccines given, their timing, and recipients’ exposure to vaccine ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But the process for adding vaccines to the schedule is already rigorous. Before a vaccine can receive FDA licensure, its manufacturer must prove it does not negatively affect the safety or immune response of other vaccines administered at the same time on the schedule, says Paul Offit, director of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia’s Vaccine Education Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In addition, “the notion that these vaccines are somehow weakening your immune system or overwhelming your immune system is fanciful,” Offit says. Today, children are exposed to fewer viral or bacterial proteins in the first few years of the vaccine schedule than those in earlier generations. When Offit’s parents received the smallpox vaccine, they were exposed to 200 proteins in a single shot. In contrast, the measles vaccine only contains 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;During the meeting, Kulldorff repeated claims he &lt;a data-offer-url="https://thehill.com/video/martin-kulldorff-interview-opposing-the-vax-mandate-got-me-fired-from-harvard/9513361/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://thehill.com/video/martin-kulldorff-interview-opposing-the-vax-mandate-got-me-fired-from-harvard/9513361/"}' href="https://thehill.com/video/martin-kulldorff-interview-opposing-the-vax-mandate-got-me-fired-from-harvard/9513361/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 that he was fired from Harvard because he refused to get the Covid vaccine; he and Malone have also each served as paid expert witnesses in two separate suits against Merck over the safety of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/kennedys-new-vaccine-adviser-was-expert-witness-against-merck-vaccine-2025-06-12/"&gt;HPV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a data-offer-url="https://endpoints.news/two-new-acip-picks-were-paid-experts-against-merck-in-court/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://endpoints.news/two-new-acip-picks-were-paid-experts-against-merck-in-court/"}' href="https://endpoints.news/two-new-acip-picks-were-paid-experts-against-merck-in-court/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mumps vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Kulldorff did not reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) did not send representatives to last week’s ACIP meeting, as it typically does. According to Academy president Susan Kressly, this was because the AAP believes the vaccine recommendation process lost credibility when its original membership was gutted by Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We won’t lend our name or our expertise to a system that is being politicized at the expense of children’s health,” Kressly said in a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://x.com/AmerAcadPeds/status/1937858504225595782" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://x.com/AmerAcadPeds/status/1937858504225595782"}' href="https://x.com/AmerAcadPeds/status/1937858504225595782" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; posted online before the meeting was set to begin. The AAP did not reply to a request for comment about the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The most recent child immunization schedule that the AAP endorses, from November 2024, is posted on the &lt;a data-offer-url="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/"}' href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AAP website&lt;/a&gt;. A newer one, posted on the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf"&gt;CDC site&lt;/a&gt;, has already changed recommendations. It no longer lists as “routine” Covid vaccines for children under 18 who are not immunocompromised but instead lists them under vaccines recommended for “shared clinical decision-making,” informed by “personal preference and circumstances.” The change &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.html"&gt;should not&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your body isn’t able to metabolize glucose in the evening as well as it does in the morning. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many factors, like alcohol, diet and stress, can affect your blood sugar, especially after 5 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians share the nighttime habits you should nix for better blood sugar control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Do you wind down at night by doom-scrolling on the couch with a glass of wine? Do you stay up way too late or eat a large dinner before bed? These seemingly harmless evening habits could be &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sabotaging your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; more than you realize. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that your internal clock affects how well you metabolize sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; As bedtime approaches, your body produces less insulin and becomes less sensitive to it. In other words, your body handles glucose more efficiently in the morning than at night.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Many factors can affect your blood sugar, especially in the evening, so we asked dietitians to share the six habits you should avoid after 5 p.m. for better blood sugar control.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-eating-large-meals-or-high-carb-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Eating Large Meals or High-Carb Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most disruptive evening habits for your blood sugar is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053587/habit-you-should-break-for-better-sleep/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consuming large meals&lt;/a&gt; or high-carb snacks within a few hours of bedtime. Because your body doesn’t handle glucose in the evening as well as it does in the morning, a large meal or a high-carb snack can be a lot for it to process, literally.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, pastries, sugary snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages are most problematic after 5 p.m. because they are digested quickly, causing rapid blood sugar spikes that the body is less able to manage in the evening,” says &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, a certified diabetes educator.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-drinking-alcohol-in-the-evening"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Drinking Alcohol in the Evening &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While a cocktail with dinner might seem harmless, alcohol consumption after 5 p.m. can significantly disrupt your blood sugar throughout the night and into the next morning. “Alcohol can initially lower blood sugar but often leads to rebound hyperglycemia overnight and disrupts sleep, further impairing blood sugar control,” says Routhenstein. This is especially true if you’re taking medications to help with your blood sugar, or if the drink is high in sugar, like a mixed cocktail.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The problem stems from your liver’s dual responsibilities. When the liver is busy breaking down alcohol, it prioritizes this process and may not release sufficient glucose to keep blood sugar levels stable. This creates unpredictable fluctuations that can persist through the night.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-disturb-your-sleep-8551851" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sleep schedule plays a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; in blood sugar regulation, and staying up too late or having inconsistent bedtimes can wreak havoc on your glucose control. Studies show that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; can impair glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Even just one night of inadequate sleep can make your body use insulin less effectively, setting you up for worse glucose control the following day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The combination of poor sleep and glucose instability creates a vicious cycle. When you don’t get enough quality sleep, your body produces more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-know-high-cortisol-levels-11762693" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress hormones like cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, which can raise blood sugar levels. Additionally, sleep deprivation can increase hunger hormones, making you more likely to crave high-carbohydrate foods the next day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-not-staying-hydrated"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Not Staying Hydrated &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Failing to maintain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-tonight-if-you-didnt-drink-enough-water-11755822" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;proper hydration in the evening&lt;/a&gt; hours can negatively impact your blood sugar control overnight. “When you’re dehydrated, the glucose in your bloodstream becomes more concentrated, leading to higher blood sugar levels,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pcosnutritionistalyssa.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Pacheco, RD&lt;/a&gt;, the PCOS Nutritionist. “By staying hydrated, you can keep blood sugar levels more stable. Dehydration can also impair insulin sensitivity, leading to higher blood sugar levels.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, the timing of hydration matters. While it’s important to stay hydrated, drinking large amounts of fluids right before bed can disrupt your sleep by causing frequent trips to the bathroom.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-staying-sedentary-all-evening"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Staying Sedentary All Evening &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Remaining inactive throughout the evening hours can significantly impair your body’s ability to regulate blood sugar overnight and into the next day. “Taking a short walk, even 5 to 10 minutes, within 60 to 90 minutes after eating a meal or snack can significantly improve insulin sensitivity and lower blood sugar levels, shares Pacheco. “If you do not have the space to go for a walk, exercising in place (such as squats) can substitute for walking.” Even gentle evening activities like stretching, doing household chores or taking a brief walk around your home can help improve glucose uptake by your muscles and support better blood sugar control overnight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-skipping-your-wind-down-routine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Skipping Your Wind-Down Routine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you don’t take time to wind down in the evening, your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress hormone levels&lt;/a&gt; can remain elevated. High cortisol levels can raise blood sugar and make your body less responsive to insulin. This creates a cycle where poor evening habits lead to elevated stress, which then disrupts blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Simple evening activities like reading, gentle stretching, meditation or taking a warm bath can help lower stress hormones and support better glucose regulation. “People often think of food when it comes to blood sugar regulation, but your stress levels and your sleep quality actually play a big role here too,” Pacheco says. “When you have a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7872589/habits-healthy-evening-routine/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regular evening routine&lt;/a&gt;, it can help reduce stress and ensure more restful sleep. This can lead to better cortisol regulation and lower blood sugar levels the following day.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As evening approaches, your body makes less insulin and becomes more resistant to it. This means you can’t metabolize glucose as well at night as you do in the morning. Many factors like diet, stress, exercise and alcohol consumption can affect our blood sugar. Understanding what habits to avoid after 5 p.m. can help you maintain better glucose control overnight and leave you feeling more energized in the morning.&lt;br&gt;

Some of the most nutritious foods on earth are also among the most affordable: beans, peas and lentils, collectively known as pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BBU6D52YPBEKPOK5N4G7M6XTWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pulses are high in protein and fiber.

Studies &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;have also found&lt;/a&gt; that beans, peas and lentils have a low carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FHQMLZZJR5BU3BN4C2DGH5LTQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Health authorities recommend that adults eat one to three cups of beans, peas or lentils each week, depending on your calorie needs. Yet most Americans fall short of that goal, consuming on average just a half cup of beans each week, said Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IFZPY67ORBCTXJUBSLJJO3Q53Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“That’s an insanely small amount, given that beans, peas and lentils are such a powerhouse of protein and fiber and other nutrients,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2HYSEMT4Y5FG5BDZIBU6KTASRQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Gardner was part of a government committee of nutrition experts that issued &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/12/11/ultraprocessed-foods-plant-protein-dietary-guidelines/" target="_blank"&gt;a report in December&lt;/a&gt; that said that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans should emphasize beans, peas and lentils as a healthy source of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/05/24/protein-weight-loss-muscle-facts/" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; and a good substitute for red and processed meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2BXGHSFNTZHG7MCOEQGGVWHXUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He said that adults should aim to eat at least a half cup of beans, peas or lentils per day — rather than per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUAXWMPQK5ANXNQ5CQS4D3KCDE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We should be doubling and tripling our bean intake — we should be eating them every day,” Gardner said. “Nutrient-wise they have all of the good stuff and none of the bad stuff — and they tend to be a lot less expensive than other foods. There are few foods that cost as little as beans, peas and lentils.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="N2RF2CNOLZDOPMBL6Q7UBMCEB4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="N2RF2CNOLZDOPMBL6Q7UBMCEB4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How eating beans can make you healthier&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6S76RUTT7BBW7AZPJDMNMOBNPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pulses are the dried edible seeds found in the pods of a group of plants called legumes, which are among the oldest cultivated crops on earth. Across the globe, nearly every culture includes some type of pulse or legume in their traditional cuisine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ETGXH7EHMZA5THT3MXLBCJZ7RY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That may be in part because of their nutrient density. Pulses typically have several times more protein and fiber than brown rice, corn, wheat and other grains. A single cup of cooked lentils, for example, has 18 grams of protein, the amount in three large eggs. Yet unlike animal foods, they’re naturally free of cholesterol and low in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JIIDF6247ZHLNEOVGPWJWGQI2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;All pulses are high in fiber and rich in nutrients such as iron, potassium, magnesium and B vitamins. A cup of cooked lentils &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/06/psyllium-supplement-how-much/" target="_blank"&gt;has 16 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; — more than half the recommended daily amount of fiber that the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label" target="_blank"&gt;average adult needs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VLHM5GTYZJGKJDSOT5XKP6S4B4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2020, a systematic &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2020.1716680" target="_blank"&gt;review of randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; found that adults who were assigned to eat an average of about a half-cup of cooked beans, peas or lentils daily had striking improvements in their cardiovascular, gut and metabolic health. They lost weight, shrank their waistlines and lowered their cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar levels. They also had reductions in inflammation and positive changes in their &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/14/im-gastroenterologist-here-are-8-tips-improve-your-gut-health/" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BXWQ2N4TOZHIHFZSOHWMUAXCBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers speculated that the health benefits were in large part a result of the ample amounts of fiber in pulses. Beans, peas and lentils contain a special type of fiber called resistant starch, which gets its name because it resists digestion in the small intestine. Resistant starch travels down to the large intestine, where it’s metabolized by gut bacteria that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35565693/" target="_blank"&gt;convert it into health-promoting compounds&lt;/a&gt; such as short-chain fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SNMDI2X4YJBURNMVWR4HE57T24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The authors of the review also looked into potential downsides. Although beans have a reputation for causing &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/03/25/why-farts-gas-smell-bad/" target="_blank"&gt;flatulence&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers found that cases of gastrointestinal discomfort were fairly rare and not severe. “None of the participants withdrew from the studies because of these symptoms,” the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7SJQBQTVRBDZRGULLLW42PLS6I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you are concerned about gastrointestinal issues, though, one of the best things you can do is to gradually increase the amount of beans, peas and lentils in your diet. This will give your body time to adjust to the increase in fiber, and as your tolerance rises, any initial increase in flatulence should dissipate, said Chris Damman, a gastroenterologist at the Digestive Health Center at the University of Washington Medical Center and the author of &lt;a href="https://gutbites.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Gut Bites MD&lt;/a&gt;, a blog on gut health and nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WR66BZBDJZBPBKKFDJKMQER7SE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The mantra is to go low and go slow,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="7PUJAXDSMNAWDJ4HTZDTTVCWIU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="7PUJAXDSMNAWDJ4HTZDTTVCWIU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Better for your budget and the environment&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JROWOPPCWVGVTELUW35BEA2NQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Damman said that when people ask him what they should eat to improve their health, he recommends beans, peas and lentils “above all other foods,” for both their nutrient content and their low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJ3S56FFVFBGPIOF6VZMKVYOVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They’re a superfood,” he said. “They’re healthy, but they’re also affordable — and that’s really important right now with inflation and today’s economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U7GYD6IXHRFULFRYMQPAJVSCFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that pulses are among the lowest-cost sources of protein, with their average prices significantly below that of chicken, beef, pork, turkey, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/06/11/healthiest-seafood-fish-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;seafood&lt;/a&gt;, nuts, seeds and lamb.

Growing pulses uses less water and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11377338/" target="_blank"&gt;produces fewer&lt;/a&gt; greenhouse gas emissions compared with meat production. It also &lt;a href="https://www.wcrf.org/about-us/news-and-blogs/why-you-should-be-eating-more-pulses/" target="_blank"&gt;improves soil quality&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3RJULKA2BBBPBEH5Z7KGXS6TUY" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3RJULKA2BBBPBEH5Z7KGXS6TUY" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;How to eat more beans, peas and lentils&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QYUBE6WESJBMZJWPQUCU7N557I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of the simplest ways to include more pulses in your diet is to add them to your favorite meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VXU2RVYIANFZDDSMYPHT2CXG5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You don’t have to change very much if you’re just adding them to the foods that you’re already eating,” said Jill Weisenberger, a registered dietitian nutritionist and the author of “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prediabetes-Complete-Lifestyle-Chronic-Illnesses/dp/1637743602/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank"&gt;Prediabetes: A Complete Guide, Second Edition&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="5JACS76FJ5DWDHZJL44MSMFHKY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating eggs for breakfast? Pair them with black beans by trying this &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/black-bean-breakfast-burritos/" target="_blank"&gt;Washington Post recipe&lt;/a&gt; for high-protein, freezer friendly breakfast burritos.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having a sandwich for lunch, add some chickpeas by smearing hummus on your bread instead of mayonnaise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having chicken salad, open a can of white beans and mix some in. “Soft white cannellini beans are really good with tuna or chicken salad,” Weisenberger said. Just make sure to rinse your beans first, which helps to remove sodium, she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re making a salad, open a can of cooked beans, peas or lentils and toss a couple spoonfuls in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’re having &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/13/legume-pasta-edamame-low-carb/" target="_blank"&gt;pasta&lt;/a&gt; with tomato sauce for dinner, open a can of kidney beans and mix some in. The taste and texture of the kidney beans will complement the sauce, Weisenberger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making chili, soup or stew for a big family dinner? Smash some white beans, and add them to the pot. The smashed beans will thicken up your stew, soup or chili, and no one will even realize they’re in there, Weisenberger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anytime you’re making a recipe with ground beef, replace some of the beef with cooked brown lentils to stretch the meat and add some fiber and extra nutrients. Brown lentils have a mild flavor, and they resemble the appearance and texture of cooked ground beef. Try adding the cooked lentils in a 2-to-1 ratio with the ground beef (2 cups of cooked lentils for each pound of cooked ground beef). You can do this to make burgers, Bolognese, taco meat and even sloppy joes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7AXAD35OE5EKLCFYCB5M2WWHPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With so many varieties of beans, peas and lentils, there are endless ways to consume them.

Sugar is woven into just about everything we eat, from your morning granola to that innocent-looking salad dressing. But according to Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a Harvard-trained doctor and wellness expert, ditching sugar for just 30 days might be one of the best things you can do for your body. And no, it’s not just about losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent video that’s now buzzing across health circles online, Dr. Sethi breaks down exactly what happens when you give up added sugars for a month—and the benefits are more than skin deep. We're talking about major changes inside your body, the kind you won't see on the scale but will feel in your energy, focus, and even long-term disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Your liver fat starts to drop"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sethi explains that when you quit sugar, especially fructose-heavy processed sugar, your liver fat starts to drop. That’s a big deal, considering fatty liver disease is becoming alarmingly common—even in people who don’t drink alcohol. Just a month without added sugar can reduce liver inflammation and start reversing early signs of damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Kidney function improves, especially if you are insulin resistant or pre-diabetic"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re insulin resistant, pre-diabetic, or just on the blood sugar rollercoaster more often than you’d like to admit, quitting sugar can actually improve kidney function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because excess sugar and high insulin levels can strain the kidneys over time. Give them a break, and they bounce back surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Inflammation in your artery goes down"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the less talked-about benefits of ditching sugar is how much it helps your arteries. Chronic sugar intake leads to inflammation in your arterial walls, which is one of the sneaky precursors to heart disease. Cut the sugar, and those inflamed pathways begin to calm down, reducing your risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Clearer thinking and better focus"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever feel like your brain is in a fog after dessert? Turns out, it’s not just in your head—well, it is, but not your imagination. Dr. Sethi says that mental clarity and focus improve significantly when sugar is out of the picture. Your brain thrives on stable energy, and sugar spikes followed by crashes don’t help. After a few weeks without sugar, many people report better productivity and a noticeable boost in concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Your immune system gets stronger, because sugar weakens white blood cells"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to fight off that seasonal bug or recover faster from illness? Your immune system needs to be in top shape. Here’s the kicker: sugar weakens your white blood cells, the front-line defenders of your immune system. In just 30 days without added sugar, your immune system becomes noticeably more resilient, which is especially helpful in today’s post-pandemic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"You can retain more key minerals like magnesium, calcium and zinc"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hidden perk? Your body becomes better at holding onto essential minerals like magnesium, calcium, and zinc when there’s no sugar messing with your metabolism. These minerals are crucial for everything from bone health to muscle recovery to keeping your mood in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens when you break up with sugar for 30 days? According to Dr. Sethi, your body goes through a major internal reboot—your liver trims down, your brain sharpens, your immune system strengthens, and your organs get a much-needed breather. It’s not about punishment or restriction—it’s about giving your body the space to heal and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s the best part: you don’t have to quit sugar forever. But even a month-long break can lead to real, tangible improvements in your health. Think of it as a detox your future self will thank you for—one cup of unsweetened tea at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you eat fruits?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During a sugar-free challenge, most whole fruits are absolutely fine to enjoy! They contain natural sugars, but they’re packed with fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants—all of which are great for your health. However, you might want to avoid high-sugar fruits like grapes, super-ripe bananas, and mangoes. Instead, focus on lower-sugar fruits like berries, apples, or pears. Also, avoid fruit juices and dried fruits," Dr Sethi explained to one user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8gFBVV95cUxQNlphcThHbGFWVzFZRjNGWlRwdmNlTmZxMHJmVHJ3OXZFQjZlRTRVM3JSZFZLbFJBSy05eVdoYlh5MkJfbTc2ejg5ZGVHMmpHUmVncDBwb3gwYnJvV3V4dnc1U3Z4dU1iRFlGTU1HbVBVeGdvR3pwT3AzRjFnUFN2STRDeW9iY0Nrcm9qMExBMDFueVF5RlpKNGo2VVVYdkNnUlZsdk5zTWdZYkxjZmdMaGRVek5LMTRJbGJYa2o4MUZsNExydS1nWkt5S21mMGsySy1JZHIxRm01NUtlYm5XYjFSYnMzVFpEUlROT3hGd0drdw</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，关于衰老的常见假设可能是错误的-西雅图时报 | A common assumption about aging may be wrong, study suggests - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNQVppS0xWVjRkaGowR3V5cm1LVldidTB0WlpuNDRqOVl0UjNZTzNSZC1NcF83bFFzVm9acE9tUDRkaUhDOEZXbVRkM0YwU0ZiS1VncnhsN0dnYXN5V2FpdHdXdXpsUS1kdlJsYkxKeXNQamdtMXJxdXVNOTQ0ZHhsYTlraEFfZEpGVF9ZQW4wV0JPWXhaTDR1RXQ0MEtyZ0k3ZXMweg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNQVppS0xWVjRkaGowR3V5cm1LVldidTB0WlpuNDRqOVl0UjNZTzNSZC1NcF83bFFzVm9acE9tUDRkaUhDOEZXbVRkM0YwU0ZiS1VncnhsN0dnYXN5V2FpdHdXdXpsUS1kdlJsYkxKeXNQamdtMXJxdXVNOTQ0ZHhsYTlraEFfZEpGVF9ZQW4wV0JPWXhaTDR1RXQ0MEtyZ0k3ZXMweg?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;A common assumption about aging may be wrong, study suggests&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lMdS1YQkRoR1pZU0pfVFZENnBTZ0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:57:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNQVppS0xWVjRkaGowR3V5cm1LVldidTB0WlpuNDRqOVl0UjNZTzNSZC1NcF83bFFzVm9acE9tUDRkaUhDOEZXbVRkM0YwU0ZiS1VncnhsN0dnYXN5V2FpdHdXdXpsUS1kdlJsYkxKeXNQamdtMXJxdXVNOTQ0ZHhsYTlraEFfZEpGVF9ZQW4wV0JPWXhaTDR1RXQ0MEtyZ0k3ZXMweg</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员表示，汉密尔顿县细小病毒的“感染爆发” -辛辛那提WCPO 9 | 'Infection outbreak' of parvovirus in Hamilton County, health officials say - WCPO 9 Cincinnati</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQRi0yYXRsdjNwNmJMVW5lZWZIbC1xOElSanczNnNnWkpfMG1IODJmM1FzT1pCdV8xdk5oRV82QmZTUWc0Y01BN1BHUHU5Sl9TdXAxV1VoZHhkRnpQRmNxMnFnYklOajV5S3VXTFUxbXZrc05rd1ZTZ243bEFHRU4wczYwcnV1by1aZGpSZWN6UDNQd2lRdjlFUFBGUkVxZWpCM3FYWTlqYnQ1dl9wQVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI — Medical experts at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center say there is a "parvovirus infection outbreak" happening in Hamilton County, according to the Cincinnati Health Department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the virus is not typically serious, but can be dangerous to unborn babies and those with blood disorders or weakened immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A parvovirus infection is an illness caused by the virus called parvovirus B19, also called Fifth Disease. It's commonly encountered in the community, especially among children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Outbreaks can happen frequently among school-aged children who may present with a lacy rash (described as a 'slapped cheek' appearance when it involves the face) and flu-like symptoms," said Kara Markham, M.D. and professor of obstetrics and gynecology, in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cincinnati Health officials said parvovirus infections usually do not cause symptoms, or the symptoms are milder and flu-like, with rashes and joint pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markham said one-third to two-thirds of pregnant women are not immune to the virus at the start of pregnancy, which means if they contract parvovirus, it's possible the virus can spread to the baby as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that's not typically common, the CDC says the infection can cause a miscarriage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a woman is first exposed to parvovirus during pregnancy, the virus can cross the placenta to cause fetal infection," said Markham. "If this occurs, the virus can temporarily affect the bone marrow of the baby, preventing the baby from producing red blood cells and/or platelets." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can then result in anemia in the case of a lack of red blood cells, or thrombocytopenia in the case of a lack of platelets, Markham said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is estimated that severe anemia can occur in up to 10% of babies infected prior to 20 weeks and the condition may even be severe enough to cause fetal death," said Markham. "However, if physicians are aware of the infection and the potential for fetal anemia, very close monitoring and appropriate treatment can be lifesaving for the baby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies who survive do so without long-term issues, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many people don't exhibit symptoms of the infection, those who do will experience them roughly five to 10 days after contact with the virus, according to the Mayo Clinic. Early symptoms of the infection in children can include a fever, upset stomach, headache, runny nose and diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mayo Clinic says children infected with parvovirus may also exhibit the face rash, which is red on light-colored skin and can be purplish and harder to see on darker-colored skin. Over time, a second rash can form on the arms, legs, chest, back and buttocks of the child, according to the Mayo Clinic. That rash usually goes away in seven to 10 days, but it can come and go for up to three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with parvovirus infections are more likely to get painful, swollen or stiff joints; joint symptoms can be more common in women than men, according to the Mayo Clinic. Those symptoms often affect the hands, wrists, knees, ankles and feet and can last roughly one to three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

But it’s often the most important thing they came in for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with &lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;strong&gt;just one more thing&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ravindra recalls patients who revealed—as she had one foot out the door—that they’d been experiencing chest pain. Or they were struggling with their mental health and wanted to get her opinion on going on an antidepressant. It’s better to blurt these things out than hide them from your doctor altogether. But the problem is that “we want to be able to pay as much attention as possible to the things that are most important to patients, and that are most important to their health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a patient mentions something worthy of deeper discussion as an appointment is wrapping up, Ravindra has to make a split-second decision: Should she dive into a conversation with them, and be late to see the next patient (and the one after that)? Or should she ask them to schedule another appointment to discuss whatever they brought up? “Then you risk patients feeling dismissed,” she says. “They made the decision to finally talk about it, and I'm asking them to talk about it another time.” Neither option is ideal, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7208914/symptoms-doctors-dismiss-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;8 Symptoms Doctors Often Dismiss As Anxiety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Melinda Steele, a primary care physician in California, can relate. “The ‘just one more thing’ scenario happens &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;the time,” she says. It can throw off her entire day. “Doctors are like ducks: We’re calm and collected on the surface, but we’re moving it under the water,” she says. “We’re getting blasted from all different directions, having to triage things, go through messages and labs, and see patients in clinic. It’s better to not be surprised by a doozy when you're trying to get out the door.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make sure you feel heard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid falling into the “just one more thing” trap, make sure you’re prepared for doctor’s appointments. Steele suggests making a list of concerns to bring along. Cap it at about three discussion points, and star the top couple things you’d like to discuss, so they get priority over less important issues. “A lot of people come to the doctor's office and they're nervous and forget what they want to bring up, so writing it down can offload some of that and make sure the issues are actually addressed,” she says. “If you have symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, move them to the top of the list and mention them up front.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7297252/permethrin-ticks-mosquitoes-insecticide/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Experts Use to Repel Ticks and Mosquitoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What Experts Use to Repel Ticks and Mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to work on getting out of the habit of what Steele calls “problem hoarding.” There’s no need to stockpile issues until you have “enough” to justify a visit. “It's pretty common for people to come in with a big list of issues, because they feel like there needs to be enough to justify taking time off work,” she says. “Reaching out to your doctor earlier and tackling issues earlier can definitely prevent complications”—and ensure appointments are as seamless and satisfying as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea, Ravindra says, is to add notes when you schedule your appointment via your online portal. Many systems allow you to enter text describing what you'd like to talk about, and she always reviews them in advance. “Then I have a good sense of, is this going to be a quick, straightforward visit? Or do I need to make sure I allow adequate time?” she says. Plus, people who are nervous about bringing up sensitive topics in-person often feel more at ease putting them on their doctors’ radar virtually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What doctors can do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of every appointment, Ravindra asks patients: “What’s on your mind today? Is there anything you want to specifically make sure we cover?” That helps reduce the possibility of being blindsided by “just one more thing" at the end of the allotted time, she’s found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele advises doctors ask patients if they brought a list of concerns, and if so, whether they can look at it together while setting an appointment agenda. “Skim it with the patient, because then you can highlight, ‘Oh, I see you have chest pain as No. 15. Why don't we move that up to the top?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7270606/questions-to-ask-doctor-appointment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10 Questions You Should Always Ask at Doctors’ Appointments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;10 Questions You Should Always Ask at Doctors’ Appointments&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also urges clinicians to avoid falling into a rabbit hole and going deep on the first issue a patient brings up. “Doctors are fix-it people,” she says. “We’re listening, but our minds are thinking and strategizing, ‘What could be causing these symptoms, and what am I going to do about it?’” Yet it’s best to hold off on problem-solving until you’ve talked through and ranked a patient’s issues by urgency and priority, she tells doctors, so that an entire appointment isn't accidentally focused on one problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and just one more thing—keep in mind that both doctors and patients have the same achievable goal. “At the end of the day, patients want to be heard and cared for, and doctors want the exact same thing” for their patients, Steele says. “Communicating effectively is going to be the best approach for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wondering what to say in a tricky social situation?

The findings show that drinking a modest dose of peppermint tea improved several types of cognitive performance compared to a placebo. These benefits were accompanied by increased blood flow in the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain responsible for functions such as attention and working memory. But unexpectedly, these vascular changes did not explain the improvements in cognition, suggesting that other mechanisms may be responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that peppermint can improve attention, working memory, and even mood. Some scientists have proposed that these benefits arise because peppermint increases cerebral blood flow, especially in the prefrontal cortex. This would allow more oxygen and nutrients to reach the brain, potentially enhancing mental performance. Others have pointed to peppermint’s active ingredients, such as menthol, which may influence neurotransmitter systems involved in cognition. The current study aimed to test whether improved blood flow really acts as a bridge between peppermint and better thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The project was conceptualized and executed by my master’s student, Luka Netzler, who has now gone onto to study for a PhD,” explained corresponding author Brian Lovell, an associate professor at Northumbria University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cognitive enhancing effects of peppermint are well established, but little attention has been paid to the possible mechanisms, particularly neurovascular mechanisms, that might underlie these effects. Here, we wanted to explore this more, asking whether acute (short term) positive changes in cognition, particularly memory and attention, following consuming small amounts of peppermint team might be mediated by increased oxygenated blood flow to the prefrontal cortex, assessed with fNIRS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers at a UK-based institution recruited 25 healthy adult volunteers, aged between 20 and 56 years, and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. One group consumed a cup of peppermint tea, while the other received a placebo—a cup of warm water that participants were told contained peppermint extract. This single-blind design ensured that participants were unaware of which condition they were in, helping to control for expectation effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a battery of computerized tasks both before and after drinking their assigned beverage. These tasks measured a range of mental functions, including memory, attention, and visuospatial processing. For example, the picture recall task tested episodic memory by asking participants to recognize previously viewed images. Another task, called serial threes, required participants to subtract three repeatedly from a large number, which tests attention and working memory. The study also included tasks for short-term word recall and visuospatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, researchers used near-infrared spectroscopy, or NIRS, to monitor changes in brain activity by measuring blood oxygenation levels. This non-invasive method tracks the relative concentrations of oxygenated and total hemoglobin in the brain and is especially well suited to measuring blood flow in the prefrontal cortex. Measurements were taken both at rest and during task performance, both before and after the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants who drank peppermint tea performed better on all four cognitive tasks after consumption. They showed greater improvements in episodic memory, working memory, short-term word recall, and visuospatial memory compared to the placebo group. These differences were statistically significant and consistent across the different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the placebo group actually showed a slight decline in performance on some tasks during the second round of testing, which might reflect the effects of fatigue or reduced motivation—something that peppermint appears to have buffered against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cognitive improvements, those in the peppermint group also showed increased blood oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex. Two key markers of hemodynamic activity—oxygenated hemoglobin and total hemoglobin—were significantly higher after drinking peppermint tea. These effects were not observed in the placebo group, supporting the idea that peppermint promotes greater cerebral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Peppermint, consumed as a tea, engenders short term improvements in cognition, particularly memory and attention,” Lovell told PsyPost. “Our protocol did not permit us to investigate the sustainability of these beneficial cognitive effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the researchers found no connection between changes in blood flow and improvements in cognitive performance. Statistical analyses showed that the rise in blood oxygenation did not predict how much a participant’s memory or attention improved. Even after adjusting for blood flow changes, the cognitive benefits of peppermint remained significant. This suggests that increased blood flow is not the reason why peppermint improves thinking, at least in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result was somewhat surprising to the research team, who had expected blood flow to play a mediating role. It’s possible that the small sample size limited their ability to detect a relationship, Lovell said. Larger studies are generally needed to test mediation effects reliably, especially when the links between variables are subtle. The researchers also noted that the way NIRS data was handled may have influenced the outcome. Future studies might benefit from more detailed analyses of the timing and location of blood flow changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One alternative explanation is that peppermint affects brain chemistry in ways that are independent of blood flow. Menthol, a major compound in peppermint, interacts with receptors involved in the cholinergic system, which plays a key role in learning and memory. Menthol may help preserve acetylcholine levels in the brain by blocking enzymes that break it down, enhancing the transmission of signals between neurons. It also activates certain receptor channels that influence alertness and sensory processing. These chemical pathways may offer a better explanation for peppermint’s cognitive effects than changes in blood supply alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings are in line with previous work showing that peppermint can sharpen mental performance. Unlike many earlier studies that used peppermint aroma, this one used a relatively small dose of peppermint tea—just 200 milliliters. The low dose and simple preparation suggest that peppermint may be a practical and natural tool for improving cognitive performance in everyday settings. The fact that the placebo group’s performance declined on some tasks while the peppermint group improved raises the possibility that peppermint may help combat short-term mental fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results are promising, the authors caution that the study has limitations. Most notably, the sample size was small, and the design only assessed short-term effects. It is unknown how long the cognitive benefits of peppermint might last. The study also did not control for participants’ diet, caffeine intake, or physical activity, all of which can influence cognition and blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also raises questions for future research. For instance, if blood flow is not the mediator, what is? Further studies could explore other physiological or chemical processes, such as changes in neurotransmitters, that might account for the observed effects. It may also be useful to test different doses of peppermint or to examine whether specific compounds in the plant are more responsible for its benefits. Menthol is likely not the only active ingredient—peppermint contains a range of other chemicals, including menthone and limonene, which might also influence brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, Lovell said he hopes to build on these results by conducting larger studies with more post-intervention assessments and more precise imaging techniques. By examining how different compounds in peppermint affect the brain and how long the benefits last, they aim to better understand the potential of this everyday herb to support cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/hup.70005" target="_blank"&gt;A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial Exploring the Short-Term Cognitive and Cerebrovascular Effects of Consuming Peppermint Tea: A Mediation Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Luka Netzler and Brian Lovell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:09:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPc3dPVEEtMkRpUG8tZHA2aTdzWlFNS1JJNmRuY0lZWldwU1FiUlkwUGxvcndPR2NnaTNIelltSmQxMGo3ZW5kN1A0NkNXRWhPbVlINGJ3WWtnQW5rVWNUSzBKOTNzdkNmRng5QXpveFNzMHFpYVpmSGNoVE44X2tkUg</guid></item><item><title>“图坦卡蒙的诅咒”可以隐藏一个秘密的抗癌化合物- ScienceAlert | 'Curse of Tutankhamun' Could Hide a Secret Cancer-Fighting Compound - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOMU1KZDkzYnRmbkZkeWlpdzhNeW9zZUlLYlJ2a2paSkxkZWQ0NkJVVFI1Q1dRNHJNMFlGcDRPWTVtSFVuUXlEWGZsTDVmSTY2cVp6eFQtME9UV3J2M3FfRV9CRGJsSWhBZkpUNW5EZDNSYkRISEs3NnhsUlBvVnZrMUlZZ1lhb18zX3dLSVBpZ3dMU0J0WkVfZTFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

When modified, they even performed as well as some chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The compounds are called &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomally_synthesized_and_post-translationally_modified_peptides"&gt;&lt;span&gt;RiPPs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for short (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides), and they are made by a variety of organisms, including plants and bacteria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In recent years, plant-derived RiPPS have shown &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14194758"&gt;&lt;span&gt;great&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/cimb47010006"&gt;&lt;span&gt;potential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in fighting off some types of cancer, but fungal RiPPS are not as well researched and can be misidentified because of their unique structures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Even though only a few have been found, almost all of them have strong bioactivity," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.seas.upenn.edu/penn-engineers-turn-toxic-fungus-into-anti-cancer-drug/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lead author and biomolecular engineer Qiuyue Nie from UPenn.

In humans, an aspergillosis infection can lead to chronic lung conditions that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aspergillosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369619"&gt;&lt;span&gt;may be fatal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; if left untreated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1973, some of the scientists who opened the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Casimir_IV_Jagiellon"&gt;tomb of a Polish King&lt;/a&gt; ended up dying prematurely. A microbiologist at the time found evidence of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;A. flavus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the tomb, which led to the assumption that this is what had killed the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This logic was then applied to the curious fates of workers and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert,_5th_Earl_of_Carnarvon"&gt;an earl who attended&lt;/a&gt; the opening of Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun's tomb in the early 20th century, only to famously die of illness days (or in the cases of the workers, years) later. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aspergillus's&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; role in these deaths has fuelled imaginations. But its rise to fame in the history books has brought the fungus scientific attention in the modern era.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Inspired by other studies which have linked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;A. flavus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to anticancer activity, Nie and colleagues scanned a dozen different &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus &lt;/i&gt;strains for RiPPs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Using metabolic and genetic techniques, they zoomed in on four different purified compounds with similar, complex structures. They named them asperigimycins.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In lab experiments, two out of the the four asperigimycins exhibited high potency against leukemia cells, although none worked on breast, liver, or lung cancer cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When researchers modified one RiPP and added a fatty molecule (a lipid), the compound showed enhanced anti-cancer activity on several different leukemia cell lines and a breast cancer cell line.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, this altered RiPP performed on par with two chemotherapy drugs approved by the FDA for leukemia: &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytarabine"&gt;cytarabine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daunorubicin"&gt;daunorubicin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166443" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Gao-Lab-Fungal-RiPPs-12-768x512-1-642x428.jpg" alt="Gao Lab Fungal RiPPs" class="size-medium wp-image-166443" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Gao-Lab-Fungal-RiPPs-12-768x512-1-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Gao-Lab-Fungal-RiPPs-12-768x512-1-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Gao-Lab-Fungal-RiPPs-12-768x512-1-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Gao-Lab-Fungal-RiPPs-12-768x512-1.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166443" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt; cultured in the lab.

In these models, the skin cells were exposed to air while being nourished underneath with a liquid nutrient designed to mimic the way your skin gets nutrients from your blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.0"&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://www.goldenbergdermatology.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.goldenbergdermatology.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gary Goldenberg, M.D." data-node-id="4.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="4.2.0"&gt;Gary Goldenberg, M.D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital; &lt;a href="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-node-id="4.4" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://eternaldermatology.com/about/" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ife J.

After seven days, the researchers discovered that the skin that was treated with vitamin C had a thicker epidermal cell layer without impacting the stratum corneum, which is the outer layer of skin made up of dead cells. After two weeks, the epidermis was thicker, while the outer layer of dead skin cells was thinner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This suggests that vitamin C helps to boost the formation and division of keratinocytes, skin cells that move from deeper layers of the skin to the surface, the researchers explained. The researchers also found that skin samples that were treated with vitamin C had more cell proliferation, which is important for maintaining the skin’s healthy barrier and creating a fresher look.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Vitamin C is a promising molecule that can be used as a developing treatment for epidermal thinning, including in aging,” the researchers wrote in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The findings raise questions about the impact of vitamin C on skin. So, should we all be having more of it in our lives for a healthier, younger-looking complexion? Here’s what dermatologists want you to keep in mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-vitamin-c-and-what-does-it-do" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;What is vitamin C and what does it do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Vitamin C, a.k.a. L-ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin. Humans need to get vitamin C from food and supplements, making it a vital part of the diet, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Institutes of Health" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt; (NIH). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Vitamin C plays a role in several areas of health, including biochemical reactions to support collagen and protein metabolism, per the NIH.

But this was not linked to increased cognitive decline in this study; speaking slowly seemed to be more significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, how fast participants were able to name pictures predicted how fast they spoke in general, and both were linked to executive function,” &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/v" target="_blank" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="Neuroscience News says" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6865008fe4b01e8bcb42385e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/v" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Neuroscience News says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, it’s not how long people paused to find a word; it’s how fluent and fast their speech was afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Jed Meltzer, the study’s lead author, said: “Our results indicate that changes in general talking speed may reflect changes in the brain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that mean slow talkers definitely have dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. This association needs more research, the scientists say; it is only linked to cognitive decline, which is associated with dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not proof of dementia in and of itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Dr Meltzer says, it could help with &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/why-early-dementia-diagnosis-matters_uk_685bba1de4b04f1da81ce183" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="crucial early diagnosis" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6865008fe4b01e8bcb42385e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="685bba1de4b04f1da81ce183" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;crucial early diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This [study] suggests that talking speed should be tested as part of standard cognitive assessments to help clinicians detect cognitive decline faster and help older adults support their brain health as they age,” he told &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/speech-speed-brain-health-aging-25661/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Neuroscience News." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6865008fe4b01e8bcb42385e" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://neurosciencenews.com/speech-speed-brain-health-aging-25661/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Neuroscience News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost UK</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 11:10:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxPdnFhd3ZzWkFUUkNMYlNLeUxJbVE4VVM1Q0FxdU1LVFF1QmMweFlrSWNTTXJIRl83LUg4RjhNazdzdTNDS0NYUUtDdmVMWFFVd09zTmVSeXZnNjdjNlpVMlFTbjdlaGY5YS1wRkE2dUJ3M2R1YUpjc3FOT0FORnNQZU9fR3pqajNmSU5vRW9PbktXVUxtcEpoaWd2bmFrdHc00gGnAUFVX3lxTE9ibzlxbXQxcW5Hd2ROOUFHQUZyZjZ0RWZfYW1lY3dBbW1Wc1REalJIZ0NDVWRGVTQzanZJRXhsRVVSaFJDSEVvQWtuY0FCaVB2S19kY3pPeXJPdTI2NzJIRHNIMV9tU20xbnp4TVhfVkZqZFB1RmcwdXpLOTU2VUtTUFhOOEM4MFRUSTc1MXB2TWpEOFJ2STVSRmJ4anJBWVRnWndnZVM0</guid></item><item><title>洛杉矶火灾后，空气中发现了一种新的有毒金属。没人知道它来自哪里-旧金山纪事报 | A new toxic metal has been found in the air after L.A. fires.

While that certainly can happen, there are a new swath of dietitians following a set of inclusive nutrition guidelines that reject diet culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These folks, known as anti-diet dietitians and nutritionists, “help people build a healthy relationship with food, their body and health — without the pressure to shrink themselves,” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/your.latina.nutritionist/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dalina Soto" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686299f5e4b0a244c713d552" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/your.latina.nutritionist/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;Dalina Soto&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a href="https://yourlatinanutritionist.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Your Latina Nutritionist" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686299f5e4b0a244c713d552" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://yourlatinanutritionist.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;Your Latina Nutritionist&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost. You also won’t find rigid food rules or meal plans, Soto said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how an anti-diet dietitian practices varies depending on their training and preference, but it may mean they focus on intuitive eating or help you unlearn the diet-culture-coded thought patterns you have. Thoughts like, “eating a whole bagel is bad,” for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anti-diet dietitians still help people achieve goals like managing diabetes or lowering blood pressure, just in a way that doesn’t employ shame as the motivator. Instead, they celebrate bodies of all shapes and sizes that have always existed and will always exist, said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/abbytherd/?hl=en" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Abby Chan" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686299f5e4b0a244c713d552" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/abbytherd/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;Abby Chan&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and co-owner of &lt;a href="https://www.evolveflg.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Evolve Flagstaff" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686299f5e4b0a244c713d552" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.evolveflg.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;Evolve Flagstaff&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona. Anti-diet dietitians also look at health holistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at someone’s health, that doesn’t just mean physical health. It means emotional health and mental health, community health and all these other ways that we’re relating to the world around us,” Chan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diet culture, with its strict rules and shame-ridden meal plans, makes it hard to have prime mental and emotional health. And, unfortunately, it’s just as hard to turn off the noise of diet culture in a world that is heavily influenced by it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say there are certain common thoughts and phrases that celebrate diet culture (and make folks feel bad). Here’s what some of those phrases are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Referring to any food as “bad.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling any foods or drinks “bad” is a diet culture red flag, said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/find.food.freedom/?hl=en" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Sam Previte" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686299f5e4b0a244c713d552" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/find.food.freedom/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Sam Previte&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and the founder of &lt;a href="https://find-foodfreedom.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Find Food Freedom" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686299f5e4b0a244c713d552" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://find-foodfreedom.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Find Food Freedom&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s true whether you’re referring to a certain food, ingredient or even yourself after eating something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s applying morality to food, and it’s so important to recognize that removing morality from food, meaning calling it good or bad, can help make peace with it,” said Previte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, people think they can just eat “healthy food” and rid their lives of any guilt or shame that could come from eating these more fun foods, Previte noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sure, you could try that for a little bit, but diets are unsustainable, you’re going to eat these fun foods like cake and pizza, and they should be enjoyed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no meal plan in the world that is going to be able to remove guilt and shame from your eating experiences if you’re feeling those, and that’s where this intuitive eating, anti-diet work comes in,” Previte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nutrient-dense foods play an important role in your meal plan, but so do “these fun, indulgent foods that taste so good and are so much more than just fuel. They’re tradition, they’re culture, they’re emotions, they’re comfort. They’re so many things,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. “Clean eating.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clean eating” is all over social media and even on the shelves of certain grocery stores, but it’s a term that anti-diet dietitians take issue with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do we define ‘clean’? One, we don’t even have the definition for what ultra-processed food is right now that anyone can agree on, and so how do we define ‘clean’?” said Chan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is it that you wash your food or you wash your hands before eating? If so, that’s great, but I think ... it’s rooted from this place of chemophobia,” which is a fear or prejudice against chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, it’s worth noting that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is made up of chemicals, even those pieces of fruit which are often referred to as a “clean” food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s only when there is a nutrition label with ‘scary’ ingredients listed do people think that they’re about to eat something ‘bad,’” Chan added. (Which, of course, isn’t true.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The clean eating really, really bothers me because also, on the flip side of that, if you’re not eating ‘clean,’ then what does that mean? That means that you’re eating dirty, and nobody wants to be ‘dirty,’” Chan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. “Empty calories.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often see people talking about empty calories, and that’s just a false narrative,” Previte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I cringe at my younger self. I often talk about how I was taught to be more of a diet culture dietitian, as most dietitians are classically trained in restricting people, and so I remember using that rhetoric of ‘Well, that’s an empty calorie because it doesn’t provide a lot of nutrient density,’” said Previte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While certain foods do provide different vitamins and minerals, all calories provide our body with energy, Previte noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, there’s no such thing as an empty calorie. You’ll find a lot of people use that terminology for a donut, or some type of carb-rich food, usually,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you were stranded on an island and only had donuts to eat, it would be nutritious, delicious and keep you alive by supplying your body with calories, Previte said. Meaning, there is nothing “empty” about those calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Diet culture trains folks to feel ashamed of the foods they eat, but anti-diet culture is trying to change that.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. “This is my cheat meal.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheat meals and cheat days are synonymous with workout and diet culture. For example, someone who’s trying to hit a certain weight may refer to the weekend as their “cheat days” or may refer to a lunch out with friends as a “cheat meal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But using the phrase “cheat meals” once again brings morality into food, Previte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we believe that all food is neutral, or if we believe that all foods fit, there’s no such thing as cheating, because it’s just food,” added Previte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. “I don’t eat processed foods.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed foods are forever vilified by wellness influencers who call these products “bad” and link them to health issues, but&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/processed-foods-what-you-should-know" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" processed foods are simply items" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="686299f5e4b0a244c713d552" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/processed-foods-what-you-should-know" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt; processed foods are simply items&lt;/a&gt; that are altered from their original state in any way, whether that’s by washing, mixing, cooking or freezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t eat processed foods ... what does that mean? You don’t cut your carrots and you don’t wash them? Because technically, that’s processing them,” said Chan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people hear the phrase “processed foods,” they think of items that aren’t nutrient-dense and “shouldn’t” be part of their meal plan, but this couldn’t be further from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these foods are just accessible, whether it be from an ability standpoint, some people may not be able to chop and cut all of their fruits and vegetables,” Chan said.

The research shows that the compound changes both early visual perception and later self-referential processing, effectively weakening the brain’s usual distinction between self and others. These findings, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811925002502" target="_blank"&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/a&gt;, could help explain why psychedelics often produce feelings of ego dissolution and connectedness, and may shed light on their therapeutic potential for mental health conditions involving rigid self-focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayahuasca is a traditional psychoactive brew from the Amazon, typically made by combining a DMT-containing plant with another that inhibits the breakdown of DMT in the body. DMT, short for N,N-dimethyltryptamine, is a powerful psychedelic compound that, when taken on its own, is rapidly broken down by enzymes in the gut. The other ingredient, usually a vine containing harmine or other beta-carbolines, blocks this breakdown and allows the DMT to take effect. Together, these two substances produce an intense psychedelic experience characterized by vivid visuals, altered perception of self, and emotional insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers behind the new study set out to investigate how this combination of substances influences one specific domain of perception: how we recognize faces and distinguish between ourselves and others. Previous research has shown that psychedelics affect visual perception and the brain’s default mode network, which is associated with self-referential thought. However, there has been little exploration of how psychedelics affect face recognition and the brain’s response to familiar and unfamiliar faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were fascinated by how psychedelics like DMT alter the sense of self and blur boundaries between self and others,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dila-suay/" target="_blank"&gt;Dila Suay&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the IMT School for Advanced Studies and the University of Zurich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These effects are often described subjectively, but less is known about their neural basis, especially in relation to face perception, which plays a central role in social identity. This study aimed to investigate whether a DMT/harmine formulation could measurably affect how the brain differentiates between self and other faces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine this, the researchers conducted a placebo-controlled experiment involving thirty healthy male volunteers. Each participant took part in three experimental sessions. In one session, they received a placebo; in another, they were given only harmine; and in the third, they received both DMT and harmine. The DMT was administered through a nasal spray, while harmine was taken in tablet form. Each session was separated by a two-week washout period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During each session, participants completed a face recognition task while wearing an EEG cap that recorded electrical activity in the brain. The task involved viewing a series of images on a screen, including pictures of their own face, faces of well-known celebrities they recognized, and completely unfamiliar faces. Occasionally, scrambled images were included as targets to ensure participants stayed focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EEG allowed the researchers to track brain responses to the faces at different time points, focusing on three specific brain signals. The P1 signal appears very early, around 100 milliseconds after seeing a stimulus, and is associated with basic visual processing. The N170 signal, which occurs slightly later, is related to the brain’s ability to recognize faces as faces. The P300 signal appears later still, and reflects deeper cognitive processing, such as distinguishing between familiar and unfamiliar information and allocating attention to self-relevant stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the combination of DMT and harmine altered face processing at all three stages. Across all face types—self, familiar, and unknown—the DMT/harmine mixture enhanced the P1 response. This suggests that the drug increased early visual responsiveness, making the brain more reactive to incoming visual information. At the same time, it reduced the N170 response, which points to a disruption in the brain’s ability to structurally process faces. In other words, while participants’ visual systems were more sensitive overall, they became less efficient at recognizing faces as coherent, structured identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most interesting effects appeared in the P300 signal. Under placebo and harmine-only conditions, the brain showed a strong distinction between self and other faces in this later stage of processing. The self-face triggered a larger P300 response, reflecting its special significance and the brain’s tendency to give it more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, under the influence of DMT/harmine, this difference shrank. The P300 response to the self-face became more similar to the response to familiar and unfamiliar faces. This suggests that the brain was no longer treating the self as uniquely special. The neural boundary between self and others had become less defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised by how consistent the neural flattening was across participants and face types,” Suay told PsyPost. “Even early visual markers like the N170, which typically reflect facial recognition, were significantly dampened. It suggests that DMT not only alters conscious experience but also disrupts fundamental stages of face perception, challenging how we define the “self” at the perceptual level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the brain’s response to familiar faces, such as celebrities, remained relatively stable across all conditions. This indicates that the drug did not simply disrupt all face processing indiscriminately. Instead, it appeared to target self-referential processing in a selective way, diminishing the sense of distinction between self and other without erasing recognition of socially meaningful faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that these changes in brain activity were related to participants’ subjective experiences. Reductions in the N170 and P300 signals under DMT/harmine were associated with stronger reports of ego dissolution, spiritual experiences, and vivid imagery. This suggests that the neural blurring of self-other boundaries may contribute to the felt experience of losing one’s sense of a separate self, a hallmark of many psychedelic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings help explain how psychedelics can produce profound changes in the sense of self. The attenuation of the P300 response to one’s own face may reflect a reduction in the brain’s usual tendency to prioritize self-relevant information. This could underlie the feeling of being less self-centered or more connected to others. At the same time, the fact that familiar faces were still processed normally suggests that the brain retains an anchor to social reality, even as the boundaries between self and other begin to shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that under the influence of this ayahuasca-inspired formulation, the brain becomes less distinct in how it processes one’s own face compared to familiar or unfamiliar faces,” Suay explained. “This supports the idea that psychedelics can dissolve rigid self-other boundaries, which may underlie some of their therapeutic and empathic effects. It also adds to a growing understanding of how identity and self-perception are dynamically constructed in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic may be part of what makes psychedelics therapeutically promising for conditions like depression or social anxiety, where people can become overly fixated on negative self-referential thoughts. By loosening the brain’s grip on the self as a distinct and fixed entity, psychedelics may create space for new perspectives and emotional flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, the study has limitations. It only included healthy male participants. The effects observed were tied to a specific dose and route of administration, so they might not apply to other psychedelic compounds or delivery methods. Also, while EEG offers detailed timing of brain activity, it lacks spatial precision, making it difficult to pinpoint exactly which brain areas are responsible for the observed effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effects we observed may differ in clinical populations or across repeated exposures. Additionally, although EEG allowed us to track real-time changes in brain activity with high precision, it doesn’t provide detailed spatial information about which brain areas are involved. Future studies combining EEG with techniques like fMRI or source localization could deepen our understanding of where and how these alterations occur in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important consideration is that ego dissolution is not always experienced as positive. In this study, reductions in the brain’s differentiation between self and others were more strongly associated with feelings of anxious disorientation than with blissful unity. This highlights that psychedelics can produce a range of psychological experiences, and not all of them are therapeutic. Understanding what determines whether ego dissolution is beneficial or distressing is an important goal for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that future studies should explore how these brain responses change over time and whether the effects on self-referential processing persist after the psychedelic experience ends. They also propose looking at connectivity patterns in the brain to see how information flows between regions during these altered states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re currently exploring more nuanced analyses, including connectivity patterns, to better understand how self-related processing is reconfigured under psychedelics,” Suay said. “In the long run, we hope to bridge this kind of basic neuroscience with clinical applications, especially in therapies targeting self-related disorders like depression, trauma or identity disturbances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think what’s most compelling is that we’re starting to see how subjective changes in identity during psychedelic experiences can be objectively tracked in the brain.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 77-year-old man in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;Seven hours before being admitted to a hospital, the patient developed shortness of breath, abdominal pain and "obvious" abdominal distension, meaning his belly appeared very bloated and stretched out, doctors &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9462514/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9462514/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote in a report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He'd had trouble urinating and defecating for about four days, and one week prior to admission, he'd been given antiviral and pain-relieving medicines for a case of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000858.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000858.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shingles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was affecting his lower back, around the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19464.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/imagepages/19464.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sacrum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or the base of the spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;At the emergency department, doctors found that the patient's abdomen was "distended and painful," especially beneath the stomach, and there were signs of "massive" fluid buildup. Around the base of the spine, there was visible skin damage from shingles, which causes painful rashes of fluid-filled blisters. The man's heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate were high, but he had no fever. The amount of oxygen circulating in his blood was low, while markers of inflammation and acid levels in the blood were elevated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed a large amount of fluid in the man's pelvis and abdomen. After being transferred to the intensive care unit, the patient had a catheter placed, allowing bloody urine to pour out of his body for three hours straight. The doctors, who had already suspected that the man's bladder may have ruptured, then introduced blue dye to the catheter to see if it ended up in the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;This dye test also pointed to a bladder rupture, so the doctors performed surgery to both confirm the problem and repair it. During the operation, they found a nearly 0.8-inch (2 centimeters) tear in the bladder wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The medical team repaired the tear in the man's bladder during the surgery. They also placed a catheter and performed a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000145.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000145.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cystostomy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allows urine to exit the bladder through a temporary opening in the abdominal wall. While recovering from surgery, the patient also got antiviral medications for several weeks to treat his shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient regained complete bladder function after undergoing surgery to repair the bladder and treatment with antiviral drugs," his doctors reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VZozCdq8A5BsPWdX3R7jyE" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VZozCdq8A5BsPWdX3R7jyE slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;"Spontaneous bladder rupture is an extremely rare urological emergency that can be life-threatening," the patient's doctors wrote in their report. Common causes include chronic bladder infections, bladder obstructions, cancerous tumors and cancer treatments designed to kill tumors in the pelvic area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, however, the rupture appeared to be triggered by shingles, which is caused by the varicella zoster virus. The same virus causes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/64122-chickenpox.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/64122-chickenpox.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chickenpox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and after a chickenpox infection, it can go dormant, hide in the body's nerves, and reactivate later to cause shingles. (The reactivated virus is known as herpes zoster.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rare complication of shingles is urinary retention, in which the bladder doesn't empty enough or at all when someone urinates. But the man's doctors believe this is the first known time that the infection has led to bladder rupture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although urinary retention occurs in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12422336/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12422336/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;roughly 4%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of shingles cases, it happens at a higher rate in patients whose shingles affects their lower spine and sacrum. It's thought that the complication can arise from inflammation of the bladder, of the nerves that connect to the bladder, or of the nearby nerves of the spinal cord. This inflammation makes it harder for the bladder wall to contract and thus empty urine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this patient's case, a history of diabetes may have complicated the picture, as both diabetes and shingles may have contributed to nerve issues that decreased the man's ability to sense that his bladder was full. This may have kept him from seeking treatment early on, raising the likelihood that his bladder would rupture when it got too full, the doctors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The risk of herpes zoster-associated urinary system dysfunction cannot be ignored," they concluded. "Urgent intervention is required."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-VZozCdq8A5BsPWdX3R7jyE-lMdqjwpg7V3zQi7QUOJA7RoG85N7w9G7" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-VZozCdq8A5BsPWdX3R7jyE-lMdqjwpg7V3zQi7QUOJA7RoG85N7w9G7 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;I paused, and then I clicked "cancel appointment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood in my stool, the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;most common sign of colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; in young people, was going away. I chalked up my concerns to my job: I was interviewing &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-years-of-stomach-pain-diagnosed-colon-cancer-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer patients&lt;/a&gt;. Naturally, the symptoms were on my mind a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a year later, the bleeding kept coming back, and more prominently than before. Sometimes, I also had other colon cancer symptoms, such as inconsistent bowel movements. From writing more about &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-cases-doubled-young-people-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, I heard more stories of healthy young patients having barely any warning signs, only to be &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-stage-4-colon-cancer-symptoms-pain-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diagnosed at stage 4&lt;/a&gt;. And then, my grandfather was diagnosed with stage 1 colon cancer in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I still had reservations about getting a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;. It seemed expensive and intense for just one symptom. At the same time, that symptom seemed to be getting worse after a year, and I now had a family history of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I got a colonoscopy and am so glad I did — even if I'm still navigating the financial side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1ef18b2f-323a-44bc-8ebc-81e29713dbe7" data-toc-id="1ef18b2f-323a-44bc-8ebc-81e29713dbe7"&gt;Colonoscopy or stool test?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I booked a GI appointment after reading &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/katie-couric-shares-early-colon-cancer-signs-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;about stool tests&lt;/a&gt;, which can detect cancer via stool samples. It seemed minimally invasive while still taking some sort of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At my appointment, I'd hoped my age, lifestyle, and lack of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;more severe symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as abdominal pain would sway my doctor to recommend the stool test over the colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      Stool tests such as Cologuard are good at detecting cancer but not preventing it.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Cologuard
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But as a representative of Cologuard later told me, stool tests aren't recommended for screening people who have &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;symptoms. The representative also said they're meant for people ages 45 and older who are considered at average risk. This is because stool tests can detect only cancer itself. It was possible that I had &lt;a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-had-potentially-precancerous-polyp-removed-in-colonoscopy-2021-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}'&gt;precancerous polyps&lt;/a&gt;, for example, which wouldn't show up in a stool test but could be safely removed and biopsied in a colonoscopy. Plus, colonoscopies can identify other issues, such as &lt;a target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="c-link c-link--focus-visible" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-misdiagnosis-young-people-ibs-gluten-allergy-symptoms-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}'&gt;hemorrhoids or inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;, with symptoms similar to those of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My GI performed a quick rectal exam and didn't find anything. She said that given my age, the bleeding was probably caused by internal hemorrhoids or polyps, not cancer. She recommended I get a colonoscopy and some blood work to test my iron levels, which could also &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colorectal-cancer-high-mortality-young-people-signs-symptoms-disease-2024-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;point to colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;. I booked a colonoscopy for three weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="61e14b27-7b74-4479-987c-e3d17f5ce718" data-toc-id="61e14b27-7b74-4479-987c-e3d17f5ce718"&gt;I was worried about the cost and intensity of the procedure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my blood work came back normal, I wondered whether I was overreacting. Did I really need a colonoscopy?&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For one, it was expensive. The procedure would cost $2,000 total without insurance. My GI explained that because my test was diagnostic and being done to examine colon cancer symptoms (as opposed to a standard colon cancer screening), it applied to my deductible. She also said the cost could vary based on my insurance plan, how far into the deductible I was, and where the colonoscopy was being done. Because I did mine at a free-standing endoscopy center instead of a hospital, it cut down on costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The estimate I got from my insurance company was about $813. That didn't include other potential fees such as biopsies. This is still lower than the national &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/colon-cancer/colonoscopy-cost" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;average cost for a colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $1,250, and some of my coworkers under 45 were quoted closer to $2,000.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The idea of the procedure itself felt intense, too. I'd need to fast and take about $40 of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/laxatives-shortage-constipation-hybrid-work-fiber-2023-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;laxatives&lt;/a&gt; and Gatorade the night before, undergo &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/anesthesia-side-effects" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;anesthesia&lt;/a&gt;, and have my husband pick me up. There were also very rare risks, such as tears to my colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few times a week, I'd approach my husband forlornly, asking him whether he thought I was overreacting and should skip the procedure. Sadly, I learned the hard truth: No one could make this decision but me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postponing would be complicated, given our future plans to have kids: I can't get a colonoscopy &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bloody-stool-pregnancy-hemorrhoids-colorectal-cancer-2024-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;once I'm pregnant&lt;/a&gt; because of risks to the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I realized I was fortunate: I had time to pre-plan and budget my colonoscopy, I could easily take a sick day from work, and my husband could take a few hours off from his job to pick me up. If I was going to do it, now was absolutely the best time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8916fde1-0162-47ce-9641-705a1ed9cb73" data-toc-id="8916fde1-0162-47ce-9641-705a1ed9cb73"&gt;I'm glad I did it, but insurance is a pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the bad news: Months after the procedure, I'm still dealing with insurance costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made sure that my &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/how-to-use-fsa-money" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;FSA funds&lt;/a&gt;, the pre-tax money I elected to set aside for medical costs, would cover at least most of the procedure and any extra fees. But because my receipt was missing information, the reimbursement for $813 was denied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked for a complete receipt, I was told I'd need to wait 30 to 60 days for my insurance to process my itemized statement. While I was waiting, I was mailed two more bills: $124.08 for a physician's processing fee and $125.40 for the anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;
              
              
              
                
              
              &lt;span class="image-source-caption "&gt;
                    &lt;figcaption class="image-caption headline-semibold" data-e2e-name="image-caption"&gt;
                      I assumed these costs were already covered in the colonoscopy fee, which was more than $800.
                      
              &lt;span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name="image-source" itemprop="creditText"&gt;
              
              Julia Pugachevsky
              
              &lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I'm holding on to them until I get reimbursed for the $813. Otherwise, I'd be paying more than $1,000 out of pocket, with no clarity on when I'll actually get the money back, if at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="db87b3ed-d00c-454c-85d7-b1522b5c270f" data-toc-id="db87b3ed-d00c-454c-85d7-b1522b5c270f"&gt;I finally had answers for my symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news: The colonoscopy itself went smoothly. Sure, induced bowel cleansing wasn't my idea of a riveting Wednesday night. But from speaking to people who've had colonoscopies, it sounds like it wasn't as unpleasant as chugging &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3566661/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;Golytely&lt;/a&gt;, a common colonoscopy prep medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual procedure took about 20 minutes, all of which I was out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, my GI popped in to explain my results. It was a huge relief to have answers. Like she suspected, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-young-people-misdiagnosed-hemorrhoids-women-worldclass-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;internal hemorrhoids&lt;/a&gt;, swollen veins in the anus and lower rectum, were causing the bleeding. Hemorrhoids are fairly common in young people, and activities such as lifting heavy weights can cause them. Looking back, the bleeding began around when I started &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/realized-protein-intake-was-low-when-began-weightlifting-2023-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;, and my GI confirmed that it could exacerbate the hemorrhoids. I can manage them by drinking more water, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/high-fiber-high-protein-food-plant-based-sources-nutritionist-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;eating more fiber&lt;/a&gt;, and using hydrocortisone cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also found and removed two polyps, one of which could have been precancerous because of its size. A few weeks later, a biopsy confirmed that the polyp was benign, and I don't have to get another colonoscopy until I'm 45 — the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sc/when-to-get-first-colonoscopy-2021-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;recommended starting age&lt;/a&gt; for colon cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the rate of colorectal cancer rises among young people, there is a push for people to get their&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer symptoms&lt;/a&gt; checked out.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But I can understand why anyone under the recommended screening age would skip a colonoscopy. Beyond the financial obstacle, it's not a quick procedure, and it requires a support system. It's easy to feel like spending time and money on what could be a benign result isn't worth the peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;so many early signs of colon cancer are mild. Stories from &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-31-diagnosed-colon-cancer-despite-being-fit-and-healthy-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; — the ones who only got diagnosed in late stages and had to navigate much more invasive treatments with lower chances of success — ultimately taught me that it's never worth taking a chance. It's a steep price to pay, but I'm glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;July 2, 2025: This story was updated with information about the Cologuard stool test. It's usually recommended to people over 45 who have no symptoms and are considered at average risk for colon cancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Known officially as XFG—or informally as “Stratus”—it has been &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=260a9981_4&amp;amp;download=true"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; a “variant under monitoring” by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is expected to circulate alongside the now dominant &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/who-monitors-new-covid-variant-nb181-spread-america-europe-nimbus/"&gt;Nimbus variant&lt;/a&gt; throughout the northern hemisphere summer. The risk to public health is low, the WHO has said. Infections are characterized by a particular symptom: hoarseness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Stratus is a combination of the LF.7 and LP.8.1.2 lineages of the virus, and when comparing Stratus to the previously dominant JN1 variant, “distinct mutational profiles in the spike protein can be identified,” the WHO has said. “Spike mutations at amino acids 478 and 487 enhance antibody avoidance”—meaning, in other words, the variant may be more adept at evading our immune defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Stratus has been dominant in India throughout the spring, and has now started to spread at large across the world. Gisaid, a global initiative that tracks the spread of viral variants, reported that 22.7 percent of Covid samples submitted to it during the last week of May were Stratus, up from 7.4 percent four weeks earlier. These samples came from 38 different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Available data doesn’t suggest that the variant causes more severe disease or deaths than others in circulation, though doctors in India have noted that &lt;a data-offer-url="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/covid-19-resurges-how-this-new-symptom-is-key-to-xfg-nb-1-8-1-and-lf-7-variants/articleshow/121510457.cms" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/covid-19-resurges-how-this-new-symptom-is-key-to-xfg-nb-1-8-1-and-lf-7-variants/articleshow/121510457.cms"}' href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/covid-19-resurges-how-this-new-symptom-is-key-to-xfg-nb-1-8-1-and-lf-7-variants/articleshow/121510457.cms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hoarseness&lt;/a&gt; is a common symptom.

So when experts recommend a top-tier “green” you should eat daily to target visceral fat quickly, it's worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loaded with carotenoids, fiber, and fat-fighting plant compounds, this ‘evergreen hero’ helps ignite fat oxidation, suppress appetite, and reduce inflammation. Backed by clinical trials, nutritional science, and real-world success stories, this green can not only help you shave inches off your waistline but also bolster your long-term health. And mind you – this green isn’t just a trend, it’s a visceral-fat-busting essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious to know which green veggie has such superpowers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The #1 daily green for slashing visceral fat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve guessed it, it’s spinach!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, dietitians rank spinach as the top green veggie for visceral fat reduction. According to dietitian consensus, spinach stands out as the ultimate choice for reducing visceral fat. An EatingWell analysis highlights spinach’s rich carotenoid content – especially lutein and zeaxanthin – linked to enhanced fat oxidation and lowered inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of cooked spinach provides about 4 g of fiber (~14 % DV), promoting satiety and improved cholesterol, critical for trimming deep belly fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which approach do you think works better for reducing belly fat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mechanisms of visceral fat reduction:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Carotenoids fuel fat oxidation and cut inflammation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spinach delivers abundant lutein and zeaxanthin – carotenoids that activate fat-burning pathways while damping inflammation. Randomized trials demonstrate that boosting blood carotenoid levels correlates with reduced visceral fat and waist size. For instance, in a double‑blind study among obese Japanese men, high-lutein drinkers experienced significant visceral fat loss, underscoring the fat-lowering role of these phytochemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Appetite control via green thylakoids:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spinach’s thylakoids – chlorophyll-rich plant membranes – have been shown to curb cravings and boost satiety hormones (like CCK), while reducing hunger cues like ghrelin. In a Swedish trial, women who consumed thylakoid-rich beverages lost an average of 11 lb in 12 weeks, with lowered LDL even before weight loss began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High fiber leads to lasting fullness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; One cup of cooked spinach provides roughly 4 g of fiber – about 14% of daily needs. Its fiber slows digestion, curbs hunger, keeps cholesterol in check, and helps regulate glucose – key factors in minimizing visceral fat – making it easier to sustain a calorie-friendly diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why spinach is the ‘superior’ superhero&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While broccoli and other cruciferous veggies offer sulforaphane, fiber, and metabolic benefits, spinach’s unique blend of carotenoids and thylakoids gives it an edge against visceral fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-022-02525-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;DIRECT‑PLUS trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; compared a traditional Mediterranean diet against a "green" version enriched in polyphenols (from green tea, duckweed, and walnuts) and low in red meat. The green-MED group saw visceral fat drop by 14% over 18 months – twice the reduction of standard MED (7%) and triple that of healthy guidelines alone (4.5%) – even with similar total weight loss. This supports spinach’s role: it's a polyphenol- and carotenoid-rich staple that complements weight-loss effects by amplifying visceral fat decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond weight loss, spinach enhances insulin sensitivity, reduces liver fat, and supports cardio-metabolic health – benefits observed even in youth consuming non-starchy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to incorporate spinach into an everyday diet&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Smoothies and green shakes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blend 1–2 handfuls with fruits and protein powder.

It’s scientifically proven to reduce deep belly fat, support satiety, and fight inflammation. However, spinach alone won’t do as much wonder as it would – when combined with regular workout and a disciplined diet plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blend it into smoothies, toss it in salads or omelets – but make sure to pair it with a healthy lifestyle.

What's more, vitamin C concentrations normally delivered to human skin via the bloodstream are sufficient to have a measurable effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research from Japan, first-authored by pharmaceutical scientist Yasunori Sato of Hokuriku University, points to vitamin C as a tool for staving off at least some of the impacts of aging on our &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470464/"&gt;largest organ&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vitamin C seems to influence the structure and function of epidermis, especially by controlling the growth of epidermal cells," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016632/index.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; biologist Akihito Ishigami of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Geriatrics and Gerontology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We investigated whether it promotes cell proliferation and differentiation via  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/epigenetic-changes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73027" data-postid="165903" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epigenetic changes&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/9-foods-that-pack-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;9 Foods That Pack More Vitamin C Than an Orange&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy human skin contains high levels of vitamin C, suggesting active accumulation, and concentrations are lower in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01469.x"&gt;aged or UV-damaged skin&lt;/a&gt;. We know that the vitamin &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9080866"&gt;plays an important role&lt;/a&gt; in skin health, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2012.11.110"&gt;boosting collagen&lt;/a&gt; production, alleviating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-34530-4"&gt;UV damage&lt;/a&gt;, and providing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdermsci.2010.03.003"&gt;antioxidant protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know that vitamin C &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.493"&gt;plays a role&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;demethylation of DNA&lt;/a&gt;, a process of removing &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"&gt;methyl groups&lt;/a&gt; that is important for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2021.675780"&gt;genetic stability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-016-2145-x"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition or removal of methyl groups act like a kind of molecular switch that can turn gene activity on or off, without changing the genomic sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What role demethylation plays in the differentiation of skin cells called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratinocyte"&gt;keratinocytes&lt;/a&gt;, however, was unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_137472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137472" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642.jpg" alt="Diagram showing structure of our genetic molecules from chromosome to DNA including methylation" class="size-full wp-image-137472" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642-593x415.jpg 593w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/StructureOfChromosomeDNAandMethylation_642-600x420.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-137472" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;When epigenetic factors, which can come from other genes or the environment inside a cell or beyond, recruit a methyl group, it changes the expression of our genes. (ttsz/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidermis"&gt; epidermis&lt;/a&gt; is dominated by keratinocytes, which form at the very bottommost layer and slowly move upward through its multiple layers as they mature, eventually becoming the dead cells that make up the skin's uppermost layer – the&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratum_corneum"&gt; stratum corneum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stratum corneum consists entirely of dead cells, serving a protective function for the live skin cells underneath. It's from here that dead skin cells are shed, replenished by keratinocytes making their way up from below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the role of vitamin C in skin health, the researchers grew human keratinocytes in petri dishes, with the upper layer exposed to the air, and fed by a nutrient solution from below, mimicking how skin behaves in living humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Into the nutrient solution, the researchers added concentrations of vitamin C consistent with the concentrations delivered by the circulatory system. A separate group of cells was grown without vitamin C as a control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one week, the models nourished with vitamin C had a thicker layer of living epidermis cells than the control group, while no effect was seen on the stratum corneum. After 14 days, the epidermal cell layer was thicker still, and the stratum corneum showed thinning, suggesting that the vitamin C was promoting cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/grapefruit-juice-can-kill-you-evidence-shows?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Grapefruit Juice Can Kill You, Evidence Shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers sequenced the DNA and RNA of their samples, and traced this cell proliferation to demethylation that appears to be mediated by vitamin C sustaining the function of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TET_enzymes"&gt;enzymes that regulate gene activity through demethylation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These enzymes need a specific form of iron to keep doing their demethylation job, and vitamin C helps regenerate that form of iron. This effectively reactivates the genes associated with cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the influence of vitamin C, the expression of 12 key proliferation genes in the samples was increased, some by as much as 75 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers applied an inhibitor to the enzyme, the effect was reversed, confirming that vitamin C works through this specific pathway. These results suggest the vitamin may be useful to develop treatments for countering the effects of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that vitamin C helps thicken the skin by encouraging keratinocyte proliferation through DNA demethylation," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016632/index.html"&gt;Ishigami says&lt;/a&gt;, "making it a promising treatment for thinning skin, especially in older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2025.03.040"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Investigative Dermatology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Waking up from a nightmare can leave your heart pounding, but the effects may reach far beyond a restless night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who suffer bad dreams every week were almost &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;three times&lt;/a&gt; more likely to die before age 75 than people who rarely have them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;alarming&lt;/a&gt; conclusion – which is yet to be peer reviewed – comes from researchers who combined data from four large long-term studies in the US, following more than 4,000 people between the ages of 26 and 74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, participants reported how often nightmares disrupted their sleep. Over the next 18 years, the researchers kept track of how many participants died prematurely – 227 in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;The Dangers of Sleep Deprivation Are Very Real, Expert Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after considering common risk factors like age, sex, mental health, smoking and weight, people who had nightmares every week were still found to be nearly three times more likely to die prematurely – about the same risk as heavy smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also examined "epigenetic clocks" – chemical marks on DNA that act as biological mileage counters. People haunted by frequent nightmares were biologically older than their birth certificates suggested, across all three clocks used (DunedinPACE, GrimAge and PhenoAge).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The science behind the silent scream&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faster ageing accounted for about 39% of the link between nightmares and early death, implying that whatever is driving the bad dreams is simultaneously driving the body's cells &lt;a href="https://www.emjreviews.com/neurology/news/ean-2025-nightmares-linked-to-faster-ageing-and-premature-mortality/"&gt;towards the finish line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might a scream you never utter leave a mark on your genome? Nightmares happen during so-called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MbLSnGOCDk"&gt;rapid-eye-movement sleep&lt;/a&gt; when the brain is highly active but muscles are paralysed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden surge of adrenaline, cortisol and other fight-or-flight chemicals can be as strong as anything experienced while awake. If that alarm bell rings night after night, the stress response may stay partially switched on throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Continuous stress takes its toll on the body. It triggers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3253267/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, raises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/stress-and-heart-health"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and speeds up the ageing process by wearing down the protective tips of our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5590630/"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166466" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166466" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642.jpg" alt="chromosomes" class="wp-image-166466 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/chromosomes-and-nightmares_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166466" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Continuous stress can wear down the protective tips of chromosomes. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, being jolted awake by nightmares disrupts deep sleep, the crucial time when the body &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3256323/"&gt;repairs itself&lt;/a&gt; and clears &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38639025/"&gt;out waste&lt;/a&gt; at the cellular level. Together, these two effects – constant stress and poor sleep – may be the main reasons the body seems to age faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that disturbing dreams foreshadow poor health is not entirely new. Earlier studies have shown that adults tormented by weekly nightmares are more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/nightmares-are-a-good-predictor-of-future-dementia-new-study-191016"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/parkinsons-disease-bad-dreams-could-be-an-early-warning-sign-new-study-184495"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;years before&lt;/a&gt; any daytime symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence suggests that the brain areas involved in dreaming are also those affected by brain diseases, so frequent nightmares might be an early warning sign of neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nightmares are also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;surprisingly common&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly 5% of adults report at least one each week and another 12.5% experience them monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166464" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166464" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642.jpg" alt="person waking from nightmare" class="wp-image-166464 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/waking-from-nightmare_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166464" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Around 5% of adults have nightmares at least once a week. (PhotoVic/Getty Images Signature/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they are both frequent and treatable, the new findings elevate bad dreams from a spooky nuisance to a potential public health target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioural therapy for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3900619/"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4120639/"&gt;imagery-rehearsal therapy&lt;/a&gt; – where sufferers rewrite the ending of a recurrent nightmare while awake – and simple steps such as keeping bedrooms cool, dark and screen free have all been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5991964/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; to curb nightmare frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before jumping to conclusions, there are a few important things to keep in mind. The study used people's own reports of their dreams, which can make it hard to tell the difference between a typical bad dream and a true nightmare. Also, most of the people in the study were white Americans, so the findings might not apply to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And biological age was measured only once, so we cannot yet say whether treating nightmares slows the clock. Crucially, the work was presented as a &lt;a href="https://www.ean.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ean/Congress-2025/EAN2025_Congress_Abstract_Book.pdf"&gt;conference abstract&lt;/a&gt; and has not yet navigated the gauntlet of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/science-peer-review" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73086" data-postid="166461" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study has important strengths that make it worth taking seriously. The researchers used multiple groups of participants, followed them for many years and relied on official death records rather than self-reported data. This means we can't simply dismiss the findings as a statistical fluke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If other research teams can replicate these results, doctors might start asking patients about their nightmares during routine check-ups – alongside taking blood pressure and checking cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies that tame frightening dreams are inexpensive, non-invasive and already available. Scaling them could offer a rare chance to add years to life while improving the quality of the hours we spend asleep.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260008/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
