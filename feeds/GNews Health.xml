    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Two people have now died in the growing measles outbreak in west Texas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;New Mexico Health officials on Thursday confirmed the death of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;The first death was a school-age child&lt;/a&gt; in Gaines County, Texas last week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;News of a second death comes as infectious disease doctors worry that the federal government's messaging about the outbreak is putting more emphasis on treatments like vitamin A than on vaccination, even as misinformation about some of these treatments is spreading online.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those concerns come in the wake of recent comments made by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy addressed the growing measles outbreak in an editorial for FOX News published on Sunday, also &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/03/03/measles-outbreak-call-to-action-for-all-of-us.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20a%20highly%20contagious,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes" target="_blank"&gt;posted on the HHS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While mentioning the value of vaccination for community immunity, Kennedy said "the decision to vaccinate is a personal one." He emphasized treatment for measles, saying that vitamin A can "dramatically" reduce deaths from the disease. In an&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" target="_blank"&gt; interview with FOX News&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, he said Texas doctors are giving steroids and cod liver oil to their measles patients and "getting very, very, good results."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In his editorial, he said good nutrition is "a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That emphasis on nutrition and vitamin A to treat measles is concerning some infectious disease doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Mentions of cod liver oil and vitamins [are] just distracting people away from what the single message should be, which is to increase the vaccination rate, " said&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Amesh Adalja, &lt;/a&gt;an infectious disease physician and senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While vitamin A can play a role in preventing severe disease, discussion of vitamins, "doesn't replace the fact that measles is a preventable disease. And really, the way to deal with a measles outbreak is to vaccinate people against measles," says&lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Adam Ratner, &lt;/a&gt;a member of the infectious disease committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy did acknowledge that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;measles is highly contagious &lt;/a&gt;and that it poses health risks, especially to people who are not vaccinated. He said vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also protect people who can't be vaccinated. But he didn't strongly encourage people to get their children vaccinated — which is usually a key part of the public health response during an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 2019, when a measles outbreak was raging in the U.S., then health secretary Alex Azar &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/24/716953746/cdc-reports-largest-u-s-measles-outbreak-since-year-2000" target="_blank"&gt;came out with a statement&lt;/a&gt; strongly supporting vaccination and warning of the risks of under-vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When it comes to vitamin A, studies conducted decades ago in low and middle-income countries found that the vitamin can reduce the risk of severe disease and death, in children who are malnourished and have vitamin deficiencies, says Adalja.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;There's also evidence that, even in the absence of a pre-existing deficiency, measles seems to deplete the body's stores of vitamin A. Both&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" target="_blank"&gt; the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend giving two doses of vitamin A to children who have the disease, especially if they are so sick they are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, Ratner stresses that vitamin A does not &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A false idea circulating online is that giving children high doses over long periods of time can prevent measles, says Ratner. He says that's not only wrong but can be quite dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Vitamin A can accumulate in the body," he says. "It can be toxic to the liver. It can have effects that you don't want for your child," like liver damage, fatigue, hair loss and headaches. Ratner works as a pediatric infectious disease specialist in New York City. He says that similar misinformation about vitamin A made the rounds during the city's measles outbreak in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scott Weaver, &lt;a href="https://microbiology.utmb.edu/faculty/scott-weaver-phd" target="_blank"&gt;director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Texas Medical Branch, says he worries people might look at a vitamin bottle and think, "Well, maybe if I take two or three times this amount, I'll be even better protected against measles.&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm concerned that people think that vitamin A or other nutrition is a substitute for vaccination to prevent infection and to prevent spread," Weaver says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In his Fox News interview, Kennedy said Texas doctors are "getting very, very, good results." with a mix of treatments including steroids and cod liver oil. NPR has not confirmed the use of cod liver oil in Texas, but Adalja says, "there's no data that cod liver oil is going to have any benefit on measles."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And because cod liver oil is so high in vitamin A, Ratner worries parents could end up giving their children too much – potentially toxic amounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adalja would have liked Kennedy to emphasize that&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5304458/measles-vaccine-booster-health" target="_blank"&gt; vaccines are the best defense against measles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Then you don't even have to think about treatment, because when it comes to an infectious disease, prevention is always better than treatment," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We all know sleep is important, but it takes up so much time. With responsibilities and diversions still looming from our waking life, the urge to skimp on sleep can be powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet as a new study suggests, even a single night of sleep deprivation may cause significant upheaval in the immune system, potentially contributing to the development of conditions like obesity,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="153478" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;perils of chronic sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; are widely known, from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-a-lack-of-sleep-can-mess-with-your-emotions"&gt;mood changes&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive impairments to health problems like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/six-to-eight-hours-sleep-best-for-heart-cardiovascular-health"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt; or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is abundant evidence linking &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-an-important-reason-disturbed-sleep-makes-everything-hurt-more"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; with these and other ailments, and abundant evidence suggesting health problems like these are commonly driven by chronic inflammation, the authors of the new study point out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is less evidence, however, about the specific mechanisms involved: How exactly could sleep deprivation lead to the systemic inflammation that goes on to impair people's health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers from the Dasman Diabetes Institute in Kuwait sought to understand the influence of sleep deprivation on circulating immune cells, such as monocytes, and its association with systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monocytes are large leukocytes, or white blood cells, that play key roles in the innate immune system, which provides the body's first line of defense against intruders. There are three subsets of monocytes in humans: classical, non-classical, and intermediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-classical monocytes patrol for pathogens in vasculature and extravascular tissues, the study's authors explain, using inflammatory cues to help them regulate the body's immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 276 healthy Kuwaiti adults with varying body mass indices (BMIs), 237 of whom ended up completing the study. They analyzed the subjects' sleep patterns, and monitored their blood for levels of different monocyte subsets as well as inflammation markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obese participants had significantly lower sleep quality than leaner participants, the study found, along with higher chronic low-grade inflammation. They also had more non-classical monocytes, which correlated with lower sleep quality and increased pro-inflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another part of the study, five healthy, lean adults submitted blood samples throughout a 24-hour period of sleep deprivation. These were compared to control blood samples taken after the participants had had a few days of refreshing sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even just 24 hours of sleep deprivation apparently altered the monocyte profiles in lean participants to resemble those of obese participants, a condition the researchers note is known to promote chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153551" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer.jpg" alt="person working late at computer" class="size-full wp-image-153551" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/working-late-on-computer-600x361.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-153551" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tillwe/2634026113/"&gt;Till Westermayer/Flickr/CC BY-SA 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer may seem obvious – just get more sleep – but it's rarely that simple in real life. Modern civilization conspires to keep us up late, argues lead author Fatema Al-Rashed, a researcher at the Dasman Diabetes Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings underscore a growing public health challenge. Advancements in technology, prolonged screen time, and shifting societal norms are increasingly disruptive to regular sleeping hours," Al-Rashed &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This disruption in sleep has profound implications for immune health and overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future research should continue this examination of the links between sleep deprivation and immune changes, Al-Rashed and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also hope to learn if any interventions might help mitigate this effect, such as structured sleep therapies or guidelines for limiting use of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In the long term, we aim for this research to drive policies and strategies that recognize the critical role of sleep in public health," Al-Rashed &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We envision workplace reforms and educational campaigns promoting better sleep practices, particularly for populations at risk of sleep disruption due to technological and occupational demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, this could help mitigate the burden of inflammatory diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases," she &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074664"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jimmun/vkae016"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Immunology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A 3D-printed penis implant has restored erectile function to rabbits and pigs in a world first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs with damage to their penile tissue that received the one-of-a-kind surgery not only achieved erections, their rates of successfully producing offspring increased from 25 percent to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penis has one of the most complex vascular network structures in the human body. For years now, researchers have been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590183424000127"&gt;working on a model&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_cavernosum_penis"&gt;corpus cavernosum&lt;/a&gt;, the spongy tissue of the penile shaft, that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reverse-erectile-dysfunction-in-pigs-using-synthetic-tissue"&gt;could help those with erectile defects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent study by a team from China, the US, and Japan presents a new physiological model that can reproduce erections in large, living animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the model, researchers mimicked the corpus cavernosum through the creation of a hydrogel-based scaffolding – one that is strong enough to withstand the internal pressure when the structure fills with blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154200" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-642x231.png" alt="Biomimetic Penis" class="size-medium wp-image-154200" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-642x231.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-1024x369.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-768x277.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis-600x216.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BiomimeticPenis.png 1294w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154200" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Images of the full biomimetic penis model with a (i) front view (ii), side view (iii), and partial section view. (Wang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then seeded the scaffolding with pig or rabbit endothelial cells, which are the main cells that line blood vessels. Endothelial cells (ECs) can create an "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10066672/"&gt;adaptable life-support system&lt;/a&gt;" in vessel-rich tissues, helping restore and improve function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test this idea out in the corpus cavernosum of Bama pigs and New Zealand rabbits, researchers implanted the hydrogel and ECs into dozens of animals with erectile defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some rabbits and pigs received the artificial penis implant &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; ECs, but those that received the ECs &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the implant showed better erectile function overall. In fact, their outcomes approached that of an animal without erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings indicate that the implants markedly improved functional recovery, and the combination with ECs further enhanced this effect, demonstrating notable improvements in tissue regeneration and functional recovery," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the authors, led by biological engineer Zhenxing Wang from South China University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fertility of the EC groups demonstrates the recovery of erectile function and the ability to ejaculate, suggesting the restoration of the cavernous tissue in the treated males."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154212" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-642x311.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Repair" class="size-medium wp-image-154212" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-642x311.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-856x415.png 856w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-768x373.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects-600x291.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/RabbitDefects.png 1336w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154212" class="wp-caption-text"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="154179" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; images of 4 different rabbit groups: defect, implantation, ECs + implantation, and normal cavernosum (normal).

(Wang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pigs that received the EC model, for instance, showed low inflammation levels after surgery, and as the hydrogel scaffolding degraded at the defect site, new tissue progressively formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pigs were allowed to breed a few weeks after surgery, pregnancy rates rose from just 25 percent in the defect group to 75 percent in the implant without ECs group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male pigs that received the implant with ECs successfully impregnated every single female pig they mated with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154214" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-642x155.png" alt="3D Printed Penis Pigs" class="size-medium wp-image-154214" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-642x155.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-1024x247.png 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-768x185.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-1536x370.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis-600x145.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/PigModelPenis.png 1992w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154214" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Schematic diagram of the procedure for implanting the model into a defect made on the pig corpus cavernosum.

&lt;p&gt;"Currently, developing transplant materials that support nerve regeneration and effectively integrate with the host's urethra and vascular networks presents a major challenge," the authors &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Maybe dogs who chew sticks are on to something. We don't necessarily have to chomp with a canine's zeal, but the basic concept – safely gnawing some hard, durable material – might be worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a new study, chewing on a hard substance like wood can boost levels of a naturally occurring antioxidant in the human brain, which in turn might improve a person's memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people chew gum, of course, which is softer but arguably more palatable than wood (and avoids tongue splinters). Previous research has shown chewing gum can, in fact, significantly &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010209000893?via%3Dihub"&gt;increase&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/154405910308200817"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt;, as the authors of the new study note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting the brain's blood supply pumping seems to improve a variety of cognitive functions, it seems. Curiously, clinical evidence also suggests people who find chewing a challenge also tend to have lower cognitive function and higher mental impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear, though, what specific metabolic changes associated with cognition might occur following a boost in cerebral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers investigated one possible explanation involving oxidative stress in neurological tissues, which is already believed to play a pivotal role in the decline of cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several metabolic processes produce harmful molecules known as reactive oxygen species, which can cause cumulative oxidative damage in the human brain. One of the brain's best defenses against oxidative stress is an antioxidant called glutathione (GSH), which holds many important jobs throughout the body, including protecting neurons from reactive oxygen species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping to shed light on the cognitive effects of chewing, the researchers designed the new study to explore the potential role of glutathione. Despite its importance in the brain, they note, the relationship between glutathione levels and mastication has drawn little attention until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recruited 52 healthy university students from Daegu, South Korea, and divided them into two groups. One group of 27 subjects was given paraffin wax gum to chew; a second group of 25 was asked to chew on wooden medical tongue depressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154198" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick.jpg" alt="dog chewing on a stick" class="size-full wp-image-154198" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/dog-chewing-stick-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154198" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maybe dogs are onto something. (&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/39908901@N06/6995110133/"&gt;m01229/Flickr/CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects chewed their assigned substance for five minutes, while researchers used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure glutathione levels in their anterior cingulate cortex – a key brain region for cognitive control – before and after chewing. All subjects also took a cognitive test before and after the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chewing significantly boosted glutathione levels in subjects' anterior cingulate cortices, especially in the wood-chewing group compared with the gum-chewing group, the researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with results from the cognitive tests, the rise in glutathione concentration correlated positively with memory function. In other words, those who chewed wood and had larger glutathione boosts also performed better on the tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that mastication can alter the level of antioxidants in the human brain, and that an increase in brain antioxidant levels is associated with cognitive function," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More research will still be needed to back up these findings, the study's authors add, with larger sample sizes, broader demographics, and assessment of different brain regions important focusses for subsequent studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wood seemed to confer more benefit than paraffin wax gum, this study also only tested two substances being chewed for five minutes. Future research might also investigate a wider range of materials and chewing durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings alone may not be sufficient evidence to recommend chewing wood for better memory, but they do provide a compelling hint. And it would be good news if chewing wood does have this effect, the researchers write, given the challenge of managing glutathione levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since there are currently no drugs or established practices for boosting brain GSH levels, our findings suggest that chewing moderately hard material could serve as an effective practice for increasing GSH levels in the brain," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919/full"&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

            A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas this week to aid in the response to a growing measles outbreak, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xnamtm00063b6m9x7fx8p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpgsgd000h3b6m7s8ho1z1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrbh2400062e6cnep5jf09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000a2e6cuqb0f8ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000b2e6cfvwktkme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000c2e6cwtm9usqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv0hws00002e6cx76souke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv6nxi000s2e6cndkfdev4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at200062e6cjuti606p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board  found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their  care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300072e6ctwybg8wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for  inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and  “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in  the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300092e6c4h391al9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the  medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of  steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000a2e6cdxrbzlls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;board’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;final order  stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients  appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was  providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources  and medical support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000b2e6cl4ok9kif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in  2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing  additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the  medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he  would modify his practice accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000c2e6cbkua19ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" target="_blank"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xxumb600003b6meeeztgx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2du600023b6mah5eqk5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000g2e6cdoeuhaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2i4p00053b6mvl4sgoua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000h2e6cd4znip1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000i2e6c4kz9lcrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000j2e6c8ma0gqso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000k2e6cf2lnc7m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000l2e6cyj7hmk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s]  another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false  sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get  this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the  outbreak is growing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000m2e6c01cn4ikw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are  healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t  really discriminate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000n2e6cxdatyv4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies  that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say  it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000o2e6c50a1zuff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000p2e6cz16qiott@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000q2e6cdkrxspm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrkcx0000d2e6cnrxpdjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ws9jcj000n2e6ccultebiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv17ix00042e6cqg913c2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xq4rz4000p3b6mk9vcw5lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsa9zw000q2e6c8va8tapm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsdabj000t2e6cq7dibsk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsipec000w2e6c4m87d1et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wt8uxe001l2e6chmq0bgzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wtd1ix001o2e6cyvn2vi1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others echoed that sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000o2e6clzemqalo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xc1zua00092e6cun50djvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7xo2fls000d3b6mx8s93shb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understanding-infectious-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Understanding infectious disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00112e6cim844a5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xna7ln00033b6mbmoemelp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhdzsc00003b6mqw0v4gj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00122e6cqpn7eb1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00132e6cwogzdy8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00142e6chlzyxdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00152e6c8v2k4kp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001c2e6c2mf4jx73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001e2e6cz4g2ul1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001f2e6c96gesrp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xj0yyx00002e6cb0654evm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpimxw000k3b6mrnzjws7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpi87f00032e6ctsf3lox5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpx3e8000b2e6czy5syvtf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.

            “I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmkc5p002s26pbchgj8qis@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A team from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Texas this week to aid in the response to a growing measles outbreak, and US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xnamtm00063b6m9x7fx8p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpgsgd000h3b6m7s8ho1z1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrbh2400062e6cnep5jf09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000a2e6cuqb0f8ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000b2e6cfvwktkme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000c2e6cwtm9usqp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv0hws00002e6cx76souke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv6nxi000s2e6cndkfdev4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at200062e6cjuti606p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board  found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their  care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300072e6ctwybg8wq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for  inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and  “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in  the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at300092e6c4h391al9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the  medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of  steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000a2e6cdxrbzlls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;board’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;final order  stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients  appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was  providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources  and medical support.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000b2e6cl4ok9kif@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in  2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing  additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the  medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he  would modify his practice accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000c2e6cbkua19ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" target="_blank"&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xxumb600003b6meeeztgx7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2du600023b6mah5eqk5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000g2e6cdoeuhaz8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xy2i4p00053b6mvl4sgoua@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000h2e6cd4znip1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000i2e6c4kz9lcrg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000j2e6c8ma0gqso@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000k2e6cf2lnc7m1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000l2e6cyj7hmk6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s]  another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false  sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get  this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the  outbreak is growing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000m2e6c01cn4ikw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are  healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t  really discriminate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000n2e6cxdatyv4v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies  that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say  it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000o2e6c50a1zuff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000p2e6cz16qiott@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv1at3000q2e6cdkrxspm2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wrkcx0000d2e6cnrxpdjll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ws9jcj000n2e6ccultebiq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xv17ix00042e6cqg913c2r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xq4rz4000p3b6mk9vcw5lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsa9zw000q2e6c8va8tapm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsdabj000t2e6cq7dibsk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wsipec000w2e6c4m87d1et@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wt8uxe001l2e6chmq0bgzl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wtd1ix001o2e6cyvn2vi1m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others echoed that sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob000o2e6clzemqalo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xc1zua00092e6cun50djvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm7xo2fls000d3b6mx8s93shb@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="understanding-infectious-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhdzsc00003b6mqw0v4gj0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00122e6cqpn7eb1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00132e6cwogzdy8m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00142e6chlzyxdn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob00152e6c8v2k4kp3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001c2e6c2mf4jx73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001e2e6cz4g2ul1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7wmm5ob001f2e6c96gesrp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xj0yyx00002e6cb0654evm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpimxw000k3b6mrnzjws7t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpi87f00032e6ctsf3lox5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xpx3e8000b2e6czy5syvtf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xprk1t00062e6c1xq1cx39@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Last year, 14 people in New York City were &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;diagnosed with the illness&lt;/a&gt;, with an additional case elsewhere in New York State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But an unfolding outbreak of the disease in West Texas and New Mexico has cast a spotlight on measles, which is highly contagious and can prove deadly and is sometimes heralded by a rash. That outbreak has emerged at the same time that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;advocates unconventional treatments&lt;/a&gt;, has become President Trump’s secretary of health and human services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;With measles so much in the news, residents of New York and New Jersey might be feeling concerned. Here’s what to know about the cases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-1d3d1d2b"&gt;Should I be concerned about the local cases?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Neither of the two patients in New York State, both of whom live in New York City, had been vaccinated against measles — one was an infant and too young to be immunized — and the cases are not related, according to the city’s health department. The first case was reported in January, and the second in February. Both patients have recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In New Jersey, all three people with confirmed cases of measles this year were not vaccinated against the virus. A person from Bergen County who had traveled internationally was the first of the three patients to be diagnosed, on Feb. 14, according to the state’s health department. Two people who had been in close contact with the first patient were diagnosed nearly a week later and were quarantined to minimize the chances of spreading the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children aged 12-15 months, and the second for those aged four to six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We don’t want to see New Mexicans getting sick or dying from measles,” said Dr Chad Smelser, the deputy state epidemiologist. “The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is the best protection against this serious disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The crisis in Texas comes as the US Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services (HHS) transitions under the leadership of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a well-known vaccine skeptic. Kennedy has long promoted the discredited theory linking childhood vaccinations to autism. One of his first actions in office was to postpone a public meeting on immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy raised alarm among pediatricians, vaccine experts and lawmakers after publishing an opinion piece that&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/rfk-jr-vitamins-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; focused on vitamin A and nutrition&lt;/a&gt; as treatments for measles and did not endorse vaccines. In response to the Texas measles outbreak, Kennedy wrote for Fox News about the benefits of “good nutrition” and vitamin A, but did not explicitly recommend highly effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;after newsletter promotion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the CDC, measles is fatal for one to two out of every 1,000 infected children. The virus also weakens the immune system over time and leaves those affected more vulnerable to future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the US, about one in five unvaccinated people will require hospitalization from measles, according to &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.

But a side effect of this clotting factor is that it triggers a protein called ARHGEF1 — and that protein can suppress the cancer-fighting immune cells known as T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of someone taking aspirin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/alarming-rise-in-breast-cancer-rates-in-women-under-40-11683574" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Researchers Find an 'Alarming' Rise in Breast Cancer Rates in Women Under 40, Especially in These 5 States;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Researchers Find an 'Alarming' Rise in Breast Cancer Rates in Women Under 40, Especially in These 5 States &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stopping the clotting factor, you stop the protein that stops the T-cells — a discovery that the study’s first author, Dr. Jie Yang, Department of Pathology at the University of Cambridge, called “a Eureka moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before this, we had not been aware of the implication of our findings in understanding the anti-metastatic activity of aspirin," Yang said.

All had experienced the problem for more than two years and other treatments, such as smell training and corticosteroids, had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In a study aiming to find new ways to resolve the issue, surgeons tried a technique called functional septorhinoplasty (fSRP), which is typically used to correct any deviation of the nasal septum, increasing the size of nasal passageways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This boosts airflow into the olfactory region, at the roof of the nasal cavity, which controls smell. Doctors said the surgery enabled an increased amount of odorants – chemical compounds that have a smell – to reach the roof of the nose, where sense of smell is located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;They believe that increasing the delivery of odorants to this area “kickstarts” smell recovery in patients who have &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/dec/24/do-me-a-flavour-adjusting-to-life-without-a-sense-of-smell-after-covid" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lost their sense of smell to long Covid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Peter Andrews, a senior consultant surgeon in rhinology and facial plastic surgery who led the research, said surgery increased the airway by about 30%, so airflow also increased by about 30%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This study has shown impressive results – if we apply the principle of increasing the nasal or olfactory airway, we’re getting a reactivation of the sense of smell and then an improvement of the sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“With long Covid anosmia you’ve got patients, fundamentally, who can’t smell or smell very poorly, so we need to somehow wake them up. And this operation sort of does that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It sort of wakes up the olfactory mucosa and then it builds on it through the increased nasal airway – hitting that area, more odorants hitting that area – and we’re getting this impressive recovery in the majority of the patients. All patients we operated on improved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In the trial, 12 patients had fSRP and a control group of 13 patients continued with smell training – sniffing the same scents repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;All patients who had fSRP reported an improved sense of smell compared with none of the patients in the sniff test group, where 40% actually reported a worsening sense of smell. The results were published in the journal Facial Plastic Surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One of the patients, Penelope Newman, 27, from south London, said her taste and smell had “almost returned to normal” after the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Before I had the surgery on my nose, I had begun to accept that I would probably never be able to smell or taste things the way I used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Since the surgery, I have begun to enjoy food and smells the same way I used to. I can now cook and eat garlic and onions and people can cook for me too. I can go out to eat with my friends and family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Mar 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQZnBvQ0FPa3BtTjBvOGw2bl9Wc1ZzS0U2YkdYckYyaXVDbW9HdWpCdFdnODVoZ0NFY3ZBZUhQUnJiZ1Q5dDZIYmU3MzU4Qy0weTFBUll0a29sMXEwY1lvVGRpTzhsLXAycHRTQ1ZUWE9xSk14bHJBVm1hZGRvREdNVFgyODIwSlY3UDhEMWVnVWJ3SWcza1FJb0Z5VWRYMTZod3JsMjJjaE5adGdyNkt6TkJjTndxVVhkV0tidHRtZ1ByU1dMbVc0</guid></item><item><title>Cedar: Woman being evicted from supported living home, say parents - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE02SlF0cVpLVllhSlNEZU9OSjM4WUdKT3Nta3cxekdXSVdGWlQxT2I4UnB0NVNyOWx1X0o4c1hpM0JxcXBDUW1xSUdVYi1MMW82eG5ack9va0ppUdIBX0FVX3lxTE1HV1FPOVlNSWlTaVFEdDBzTWdTckp6aWhzWkg1Z09CUGkzTE91TTUzXzNRRGh3NTFQMlpHVDJzSHEza2NFY05OYzdHd0wwb1ZXeWs4NF9XbkRqSm1YTFdz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Woman being 'evicted' from supported living home - parents&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Lyndsey Telford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News NI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97cb/live/14885990-faa6-11ef-815c-cf37b1275dcf.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC A man and a woman are standing next to each other outside a house.

class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust, which commissioned the Cedar Foundation to provide Ms Sharp's care, said it was "very sorry" that the current situation concerning her placement was "causing stress and anxiety to her and her family".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It added: "Laura's wellbeing is of vital importance to us and we will continue to work with her family regarding the next steps in finding the best outcome for her."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp said their daughter did not have capacity to share her story herself and that they were speaking on her behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They said they were worried about their daughter's wellbeing, particularly given her past experience as a patient of Muckamore Abbey Hospital, which is currently subject to a public inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Relationship breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block"

deteriorated over the last year and that they had raised multiple concerns with her current care provider, including about her medication, wellbeing and cleanliness of her apartment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;There have also been ongoing issues, they said, regarding their request to bring in a private occupational therapist to assist their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp said in response to their concerns, they were accused of being "abusive" to staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In January, they received a letter from Cedar giving eight weeks' notice of its decision to end her care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp described this as an "eviction".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Continuous contact'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the letter, Cedar said it would work closely with the Belfast Trust to "minimise disruption" to Ms Sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The main reason for the decision, it said, was that it was "unable to provide the care and support that Laura needs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It added that relationships had "broken down" between Mr and Mrs Sharp and Cedar staff, citing "ongoing incidents of verbal aggression, disparaging comments, and intimidation towards staff".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It also said there had been "continuous contact" from the parents with visits, emails, and phone calls which had "led to unrealistic demands and pressures put on the staff and the service".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr and Mrs Sharp acknowledged that they may have been in contact too much – but that they were worried for their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They said they had never been abusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Looking out for your child'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A disability charity told BBC News NI it had worked with "hundreds of families" in which relationships with providers have "broken down" - and in some cases become "hostile".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Nuala Toman, head of disability and innovation at Disability Action, said: "Across the board, what we see is when a disabled person and a family raise a challenge then the system challenges back."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;BBC News NI has spoken to another family with a loved one in a different home in a separate trust, who said they, too, felt they were being punished for making complaints about care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mr Sharp said: "When you raise concerns, they call that abuse. It's not abuse. We've never been abusive, just questioning them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I have never raised my voice up there, ever, in the seven years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mrs Sharp added: "If we weren't here, they wouldn't be evicting Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's us they really want rid of. And for them to put her out of there, because of concerns we've raised, it's just baffling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;While the Cedar Foundation said it could not comment on individual cases it said it was "committed to work in partnership with individuals, families, and health trusts to do [its] best to make sure disabled people get the support most appropriate to their needs".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Wits' end'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Toman from Disability Action said disabled people and their families "deserve better".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said generally when families' relationships with providers break down, it can be "very, very lonely" for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"And we see the detrimental impact that this hostile reaction can have on disabled people and their families. Because often the disabled person is confused. And then from the family perspective, they're lost, alone, they're anxious, sleep deprived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Disabled people and families deserve better than facing a personal challenge just because you want right to be done by yourself or your child."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This, she added, had left people at "their wits' end" and feeling punished – including the person living in a care setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said that it was important to note, however, that this was not in every case and that the charity dealt with some "really positive" cases in which disabled people and their families were content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Still your child'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Toman added that the role of an advocate was vital for families to communicate with providers on their behalf, to ensure that any issues raised focus on "processes" as opposed to "the person".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But she warned that not all families had access to effective advocates and this was an issue that needed to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Meanwhile, Mrs Sharp said removing her daughter from her home of seven years would "wreck her" and would cause her health to decline rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She added that the couple had not gone out of their way to "look for faults".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"That's just being a parent, looking out for your child," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I know she's 39.

Kennedy Jr. pledged that they would talk to “front-line doctors and see what is working on the ground” and learn about therapeutics “ignored” by the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is a highly effective vaccine that prevents measles but no specific antiviral to treat it. Kennedy has previously pushed the use of vitamin A, and in an interview with Fox News this week, he endorsed an unconventional treatment regimen for measles including a steroid, an antibiotic and cod liver oil, which is rich in vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the interview, which was posted in full on Fox Nation, Kennedy praised two West Texas doctors who he said were using this remedy on their patients and had seen “almost miraculous and instantaneous recovery.” He said these doctors had “treated most of the patients” in the current outbreak, which has now reached 159 reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the doctors Kennedy is apparently taking cues from has troubled history. He was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board in 2003 for “unusual use of risk-filled medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy said HHS would do a clinical trial on the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil therapies and said “we recommend to local physicians that they consider vitamin A and their protocols. He also suggested that vitamin A may work “as a prophylaxis,” although doctors say it does not prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:says measles vaccination;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;says measles vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, which can prevent most cases, is a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“At this point, we are recommending that people in those [undervaccinated] communities get vaccines. We understand a lot of them will not, and we’re going to try to make sure that they’re taken care of through the best therapeutic interventions that we can provide them or recommend for them,” Kennedy said in the Fox interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Doctor was disciplined over treatments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the doctors Kennedy praised, Dr. Richard Bartlett, has a history of using unconventional treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett faced &lt;a href="https://profile.tmb.state.tx.us/BoardActions.aspx?5c10c894-afcc-4791-8e3c-e81b0b7998ff" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disciplinary action;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disciplinary action&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Medical Board more than two decades ago for “unusual” prescribing of antibiotics and steroids in five patients, including two children. None of the patients had measles; they came in with a variety of complaints including diabetes, back and neck pain, sinus pressure, inflamed tonsils and other cold symptoms, obesity and uncontrollable hunger, according to the medical board’s investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After reviewing the patients’ medical records, the board found that Bartlett misdiagnosed their symptoms and mismanaged their care, ordering unnecessary tests and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a 2003 order, the board cited Bartlett for inappropriately using medications such as powerful IV antibiotics and “multi-day doses” of long-acting steroids “without any documentation in the records of the weighing of risk versus benefits of this care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the medical board’s disciplinary action, or on the basis of his use of steroids and antibiotics for the treatment of measles in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The board’s final order stated that the “respondent maintains that he treated the patients appropriately, with no adverse outcomes, considering that he was providing care to a relatively underserved area with limited resources and medical support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bartlett was cleared to return to practice without supervision in 2005 after adhering to the board’s requests, such as completing additional medical education and having another doctor chosen by the medical board monitor him for at least a year. He also indicated that he would modify his practice accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;During the pandemic, Bartlett said he treated Covid-19 patients with what he called his &lt;a href="https://www.newswest9.com/article/news/local/local-doctor-believes-he-has-found-silver-bullet-for-covid-19/513-8cd065d2-dbb5-4814-9cdd-5bb0dae77703" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:silver bullet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;silver bullet&lt;/a&gt;: an experimental combination of budesonide, which is a steroid; the antibiotic clarithromycin; and aspirin. Bartlett often talked about the treatment on podcasts and in interviews, including some widely shared on social media. An independent fact-checking group &lt;a href="https://science.feedback.org/review/no-evidence-budesonide-clarithromycin-aspirin-combination-silver-bullet-treatment-covid-contrary-texas-doctors-claim/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:found that his claims;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;found that his claims&lt;/a&gt; about the therapy were unsupported by scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both measles and Covid are caused by viruses. Antibiotics, which kill bacteria, are powerless against viral infections. Medical experts say antibiotics can sometimes be helpful if a viral infection causes a secondary bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia. But they’re not appropriate or helpful in every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Steroids have been tried in people with measles who develop a very rare complication that leads to brain swelling, but using them in milder cases may be harmful because they dampen the body’s immune response just when it is needed to fight the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;A virus ‘that doesn’t really discriminate’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is no specific treatment for measles. In severe cases, doctors may offer treatments such as supplemental oxygen and fluids to help patients get through the worst of their illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Lara Johnson, Covenant Health’s chief medical officer, said its Lubbock, Texas, hospital has treated more than 20 patients and that hospital physicians have followed recommended treatment protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses of physician-administered vitamin A in cases of severe measles, such as people who are hospitalized. Infectious disease experts also recommend vitamin A in these cases, but they note that the vitamin is most useful in impoverished countries where children are significantly malnourished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The HHS secretary said the people in West Texas who were getting sick, including a school-age child who died last week, may have had malnutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s very, very difficult … for measles to kill a healthy person,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:state health department;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;state health department&lt;/a&gt; reported that the child who died had no underlying conditions, and local doctors disagree with the secretary’s assessment of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our children are actually very well nourished. [That’s] another concerning comment, because I think it makes people have a false sense of, ‘Well, my kid is well nourished, so they’re not going to get this,’” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, where the outbreak is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Whether you have underlying medical problems or you are healthy, measles can be detrimental. It’s the kind of virus that doesn’t really discriminate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy claimed in the Fox interview to have seen “studies that show [vitamin A] is good for prophylaxis,” but medical experts say it has no use for measles prevention. High doses can even be toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There’s not evidence that vitamin A has any preventative benefits,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital. “The worry is that it’s being weaponized by the health and wellness industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The only way to prevent measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy is “talking about treatment for children with or anyone with measles, treatment of people with measles that can be prevented by vaccines,” said Dr. William Moss, a pediatrician and infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “Vaccines actually prevent people from getting measles, so you don’t need to treat them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Vaccines prevent measles, vitamin A doesn’t&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy’s soft sell of the measles vaccine amid an outbreak has stunned public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles. Immunity from the shot is long-lasting, too. When the vaccine is used by enough people within a community, measles has nowhere to spread. It can be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say Kennedy’s emphasis on treatments has muddled the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/DrGiroir/status/1896353987093246011" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:post on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt;, Admiral Dr. Brett Giroir, a pediatrician and former US assistant secretary for health during the first Trump administration, thanked Kennedy for “emphasizing the critical importance” of the measles vaccine. “But please do not rely on #VitaminA to save your child in the US - helps in Africa where there is a deficiency-not here. I have both treated and buried children with measles,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Kennedy’s interview on Fox, the HHS secretary was also eager to talk about vaccine injuries and risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The CDC, in the past, has not done a good job at quantifying the risk of vaccines,” Kennedy said. “We are going to do that now so that people can make a real, informed choice about what’s best for them, for their families and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts said that hearing this from the nation’s top public health official was distressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He didn’t talk about the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccines, then pivoted to vitamin A and talking about how it was sanitation improvements that are bringing down measles rates in the US, and all this other kind of nonsense, and you just don’t do that kind of stuff in the middle of an epidemic,” Hotez said. “It was really disheartening to see that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Others echoed that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If it were someone on the sidelines kind of calling this out, I guess it would be less surprising, but to have the secretary of Health and Human Services, who is really responsible for the public’s health to tout this misguided treatment regimen for measles and downplay the role of vaccines and preventing measles,” Moss said. “It’s mind-blowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;HHS said it would review a detailed list of CNN’s questions about Kennedy’s statements in the interview posted on Fox Nation but did not respond with answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Understanding infectious disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy made other misstatements in the Fox interview that downplayed infectious diseases and their effects, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He suggested that bird flu has long been a threat, saying it has “been around for 100 years,” although H5N1 was identified in 1996 in China. It’s not clear whether Kennedy was referring to other flu types that could be carried by birds, a natural reservoir for the viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy further said that about 70 people are known to have gotten sick with bird flu, and “almost all of them were involved in culling operations.” In fact, more dairy workers have caught the virus than people involved in the culling or depopulating of birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He said the bird flu strain that originally spread in cattle during the ongoing outbreak, B3.13, “is not very dangerous to humans” because people who have caught it have not been very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says that statement demonstrates that Kennedy doesn’t understand the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Unfortunately, we don’t have the luxury of not being afraid of these viruses,” Osterholm said. “We have to take all of them very seriously as a potential cause of the next influenza pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As long as they’re circulating as they are, that just gives each one of these viruses unlimited shots at the genetic roulette table,” he added. The more people they infect, in other words, the more chances they have to change and become more efficient human pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy maintained his message that he would tackle chronic disease and “get the really bad stuff out of the food as quickly as possible.” He questioned why the US had the “highest death rate on the planet” from Covid: Was it the infection itself or actually underlying disease in the population at large?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Was it really Covid that was there killing them? Or was it that they were so sick that they were hanging off the cliff and Covid just came and stomped on their fingernails?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If you are healthy, it’s almost impossible for you to be killed by an infectious disease,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts say this typical of Kennedy’s communication: He starts with a kernel of truth, but his conclusions on an issue are often incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Kennedy is right that people with underlying health conditions are more likely to get sicker when they get an infectious disease. But it’s not true that people who are in good health are impervious to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“He’s saying some truth, right? He’s saying things that are wrong, but there’s some truth to it,” said Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert and distinguished professor of medicine at Emory University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Measles is an infection that can make even healthy children very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I really want to plead to mothers to vaccinate their kids,” del Rio said. “That is a highly effective strategy. In this country, in 2025, we should not see measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN’s Amanda Sealy, Meg Tirrell and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 23:45:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNM0VIbnpDMmVGTnV4UzZLdnBBaGdVMWJlWlNGQ1hQaEJlMXdUYmFLcmc3d3Q1a2FSYVdtM3JuZGZzLUJiZV9QQ1podEZnc3lRa2dLcGw5N2F1aWdySE1RakVPRE43MkdhaGdxRXRaNllCQjU5ZnA1TWV3M1Z4QWlOMjEtNFlvcFdVZ2FKbWZIaEdjZw</guid></item><item><title>What can’t vitamin A do?

While vitamin A is sometimes used to treat measles when someone is already infected, it can’t actually prevent people from getting sick like a vaccine can, &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Thomas Russo,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Thomas Russo,&lt;/a&gt; professor and chief of infectious disease at the University at Buffalo in New York, tells Yahoo Life. But even using vitamin A as a treatment for measles is a bit complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2010 &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/suppl_1/i48/699532?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:scientific analysis;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;scientific analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that there was “no significant reduction” in people dying from measles after taking vitamin A treatments across six randomized controlled trials. But, when the researchers broke things down by dose, they found that having at least two doses of vitamin A lowered the risk of dying from measles by 62%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But here’s some important context: “The major studies that have been done about the benefits of the treatment of measles — particularly severe measles — have been done in the developing world where children are often malnourished and don’t have enough vitamin A to begin with,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. William Schaffner,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. William Schaffner,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. In those cases, certain doses of vitamin A, given as early as possible in infected children, may help lower the risk of measles complications like pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), Schaffner explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But that’s in the developing world,” he says.

Worth noting: It’s unlikely that you’d overdose on vitamin A from food alone, notes Russo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Bobrick says these are the biggest sources of vitamin A:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oily fish like salmon, cod liver and mackerel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dark, leafy greens like spinach and kale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you’re considering a vitamin A supplement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Vitamin A shows up in some multivitamins, and Kim says those are fine to take.

&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing better than watching a slab of fresh butter soften and sizzle as you circle it around the skillet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If just the thought of it makes you jump with ghee, you butter beware — that innocent little rectangle could be melting your chances at longevity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2831265?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine linked greater consumption of butter to increased mortality rates, while &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/05/15/health/plant-based-diets-best-for-lowering-disease-cancer-risk-study/"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt; oils offer protective benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several studies have demonstrated that replacing butter with plant-based oils can yield health benefits, particularly when it comes to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/health/heart-disease-could-be-prevented-with-this-one-simple-test/"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Schiff, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Northwell Health’s &lt;a href="https://huntington.northwell.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Huntington Hospital&lt;/a&gt;, told The Post why butter is so “bad” for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Butter has been shown to raise LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol in the body, which can clog your arteries and increase your risk of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/26/health/your-takeout-containers-could-cause-congestive-heart-failure/"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;,” Schiff said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Butter also contains saturated fats, she explained, which are typically solid at room temperature and found in products like butter, coconut oil, lard, cheese and cream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, plant-based oils such as olive and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/11/health/5-swaps-for-butter-that-can-improve-cholesterol-lower-disease-risks/"&gt;avocado oil&lt;/a&gt; are rich in monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease, as well as anti-inflammatory &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/health/fish-oil-supplement-can-add-this-many-years-to-your-life/"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; — that’s why Schiff uses them “almost exclusively.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Plant-based oils are rich in monounsaturated fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;tycoon101 – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“I use olive oil in salad dressing, for sautéing foods and sometimes in baking,” she said. “It’s high in &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/17/health/6-antioxidant-rich-superfoods-can-help-you-live-longer-dietitian/"&gt;plant phenols&lt;/a&gt; — compounds that work as antioxidants and may help prevent cell damage and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added that avocado oil is also a good source of antioxidants, has a neutral taste and can withstand higher cooking temperatures than olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Stick with unrefined olive and unrefined avocado oil,” she advised. ”They’re healthier because they retain more nutrients — vitamins, minerals and antioxidants — than processed and refined oils.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Stick with unrefined olive and unrefined avocado oil,” one nutritionist advised. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dušan Zidar – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/31/health/are-seed-oils-really-that-bad-for-you-dietitians-explain-the-risk/"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, like cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil and soybean oil, Schiff knows they get a bad rap and have become quite the hot topic on social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The problem with seed oils is the high ratio of omega-6 oils to omega-3 oils,” she explained. “A healthy balance of omega-6s to omega-3s (about four-to-one) can help &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/06/health/a-handful-of-this-snack-can-boost-mood-and-reduce-cancer-risk/"&gt;reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the body. High levels of omega-6s versus omega-3s can increase inflammation.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem is that “we tend to get a lot of our seed oil from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/26/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-foods-are-everywhere-how-bad-are-they/"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, and the oils in those foods are often highly refined and processed themselves,” which is why she suggests getting seed oils that are cold-pressed if you want to cook with them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="single__inline-module inline-module inline-module--newsletter aligncenter aligncenter wp-block-nypost-editor-newsletter" data-source-unit="Inline Newsletter Module Post Care"&gt;
	&lt;div class="inline-module__inner"&gt;

					Thanks for signing up!				&lt;/h3&gt;
			&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;






&lt;p&gt;She believes these oils can still be part of a healthy diet when consumed in moderation and balanced with omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And if you absolutely can’t live without butter, opt for the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/13/health/im-a-cancer-survivor-here-are-the-everyday-supplies-ive-cut-from-my-kitchen/"&gt;grass-fed&lt;/a&gt; kind, as it has lower amounts of saturated fats and more healthy fats, as well as more vitamin K2 — which helps boost heart health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I don’t like to demonize any food, but I’d recommend grass-fed, pasture-raised butter over conventional butter if you really want to have butter,” Schiff said. “And eat less of it. Lean more towards olive and avocado oil, use unrefined seed oils and avoid ultra-processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, don’t forget that “you don’t need to be perfect,” she said, especially since “everyone’s body is different in how it processes fats.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact of ultra-processed foods on our health has become a topic of increasing concern in recent years. A groundbreaking study conducted by Australian researchers has shed light on the alarming effects of consuming these products daily. The findings, published in the journal Age &amp;amp; Aging in December 2024, reveal that regularly indulging in ultra-processed foods can accelerate biological aging and increase the risk of chronic diseases and mortality.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;The hidden dangers of ultra-processed foods&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed foods, such as chips, cookies, candies, and sodas, have long been associated with adverse health effects. However, the extent of their impact on our bodies has remained unclear until now. The recent study, which analyzed data from over 16,000 American adults, has uncovered disturbing links between the consumption of these products and biological age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-1821856092"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biological age, a measure that reflects a person’s overall health status, appears to be significantly affected by the intake of ultra-processed foods. The researchers found that for every 10% increase in the consumption of these products, biological aging accelerated by approximately 2.5 months. This means that individuals who consumed the highest amounts of ultra-processed foods were biologically older by about 10 months compared to those who ate the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/05/is-walking-1-mile-per-day-enough-to-reap-health-benefits-experts-weigh-in/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Is walking 1 mile per day enough to reap health benefits? Experts weigh in.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To put this into perspective, Dr. Barbara Cardoso, the lead author of the study, provided a striking example: “Adding an extra 200 calories of ultra-processed foods, roughly equivalent to a small chocolate bar, could advance the process of biological aging by more than two months compared to chronological aging.” This revelation highlights the importance of &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/24/this-is-the-best-time-to-have-dinner-for-good-health-and-to-gain-less-weight/"&gt;maintaining a balanced diet and making informed choices about meal timing&lt;/a&gt; to promote overall health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-1002405031"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Accelerated aging and increased health risks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings extend beyond the acceleration of biological aging. Researchers also observed a correlation between high consumption of ultra-processed foods and increased risks of mortality and chronic diseases. Dr. Cardoso emphasized the significance of these results, stating, “Our predictions show that for every 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption, the risk of mortality rises by nearly 2%, and the risk of chronic disease increases by 0.5%.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics underscore the urgent need to address our reliance on ultra-processed foods. While it may be tempting to reach for convenient, packaged snacks, the long-term consequences on our health can be severe. It’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/01/13/eating-pasta-boosts-mood-new-scientific-study-reveals/"&gt;some foods, like pasta, have been shown to have positive effects on mood&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the importance of making informed dietary choices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of ultra-processed foods extends beyond aging and mortality risk. Numerous studies have linked these products to a wide range of health issues, including cardiovascular problems, brain and mental health concerns, diabetes, obesity, and certain types of cancer. By reducing our intake of these foods, we may be able to mitigate these risks and promote healthier aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/forget-yoga-and-pilates-this-sport-is-even-better-for-keeping-a-slim-waist-after-40/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Forget yoga and Pilates, this sport is even better for keeping a slim waist after 40.&lt;/span&gt;

                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Strategies for healthier eating habits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the compelling evidence against ultra-processed foods, it’s crucial to develop strategies for reducing their consumption and adopting healthier eating habits. Dr. Cardoso suggests that “eating fewer ultra-processed foods can help slow down the trajectory of biological aging, providing an additional reason to target ultra-processed foods when considering strategies to promote healthy aging.”



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effective approach is to focus on whole, minimally processed foods. Incorporating more fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your diet can provide essential nutrients without the harmful additives found in ultra-processed products. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/21/people-who-depend-morning-coffee-often-share-these-7-personality-traits/"&gt;being mindful of habits like excessive coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt; can contribute to overall health improvements.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meal planning and preparation can also play a crucial role in reducing reliance on ultra-processed foods. By setting aside time to cook meals from scratch, you have greater control over the ingredients and can avoid the hidden sugars, fats, and additives often present in packaged foods. This approach not only benefits your physical health but can also have positive effects on mental well-being.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Building resilience and making lasting changes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Changing long-established eating habits can be challenging, but it’s essential for long-term health and well-being. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/11/30/people-who-recover-quickly-failure-tend-display-these-8-traits/"&gt;Developing resilience and the ability to bounce back from setbacks&lt;/a&gt; is crucial when adopting healthier lifestyle choices. It’s important to remember that small, consistent changes can lead to significant improvements over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/how-much-should-you-walk-after-60-to-live-longer-science-reveals-the-key-distance/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;How much should you walk after 60 to live longer? Science reveals the key distance.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One effective strategy is to gradually replace ultra-processed foods with healthier alternatives. For example, swapping chips for nuts or fresh fruit can satisfy cravings while providing better nutritional value. Similarly, replacing sugary sodas with water or unsweetened tea can significantly reduce calorie intake and improve overall health.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educating yourself about nutrition and food labels can also empower you to make informed choices. Learning to identify ultra-processed foods and understanding their potential health impacts can motivate you to seek out healthier options. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/01/doctor-reveals-five-hidden-effects-of-stopping-alcohol-for-30-days-has-on-the-brain/"&gt;considering the effects of other lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt;, can contribute to a more comprehensive approach to health and aging.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-5"&gt;Fostering a supportive environment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Making lasting changes to our eating habits often requires a supportive environment. &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2024/12/12/if-you-want-deeper-connections-say-goodbye-these-7-habits/"&gt;Cultivating deeper connections with like-minded individuals&lt;/a&gt; can provide encouragement and accountability in your journey towards healthier eating. Sharing meals with friends and family who prioritize whole foods can make the transition more enjoyable and sustainable.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community initiatives, such as farmers’ markets and cooking classes, can also play a role in promoting healthier food choices. These programs not only provide access to fresh, minimally processed foods but also offer opportunities to learn new cooking skills and discover delicious alternatives to ultra-processed products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/03/green-tea-is-good-for-your-health-but-its-not-without-risks-especially-for-these-people/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Green tea is good for your health, but it’s not without risks, especially for these people.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By fostering a culture that values whole foods and mindful eating, we can collectively work towards reducing the prevalence of ultra-processed foods in our diets. This shift not only benefits individual health but also has the potential to positively impact public health on a broader scale, potentially reducing the burden of chronic diseases and promoting healthier aging across populations.

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0006356mewioqm1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many other influencers have supported similar claims, including Dr. Paul Saladino, who promotes an animal-based diet and has amassed 2.6 million Instagram followers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0007356mp20ixo40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is a health food with amazing nutrients,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulsaladinomd/reel/Cr6QPD9PWn_/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt;, adding that butter is good for the gut, brain, cardiovascular health, and overall health and vitality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0008356mg7148zvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The evidence doesn’t support that view, according to study coauthor Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0009356m4x5tats5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For some reason that is not clear to me, a myth has been floating around the internet that butter is a healthy fat, but there is no good evidence to support this,” said Willett, who has authored over 2,000 articles and numerous books and has spent 40 years studying the impact of diet on the development of major diseases, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000a356m7uk6ei5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Willett and his team’s latest research revealed that higher butter consumption was associated with a 15% higher risk of mortality, whereas higher intake of plant-based oils — including soybean, canola and olive oil — was linked to a 16% reduction in total mortality, according to the study published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition, substituting just 10 grams (0.35 ounces) of butter with these plant-based oils daily was associated with a 17% lower risk of both total mortality and cancer-related deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000c356m274bxo9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seventeen percent is quite a big change, especially when you look at the public health perspective,” said Dr. Yu Zhang, study coauthor and researcher at the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Imagine how many deaths we can reduce in the general population.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The study analyzed 33 years of dietary data from more than 221,000 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000k356mkebc0v24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants self-reported their dietary habits every four years, allowing researchers to track changes over time and calculate long-term intake averages. Researchers adjusted their findings to account for variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total calorie intake, as well as other dietary patterns using the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/evaluating-adherence-to-recommended-diets-in-adults-the-alternate-healthy-eating-index/1163D3C29653628A1209EB88AE166BF1" target="_blank"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000l356mq21xx4jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Butter intake included any amount used in cooking and baking, as well as any extra butter spread on food. Plant-based oil consumption was estimated based on the type of oil used in frying, sautéing, baking or making salad dressings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000m356mbqoxvqnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Marion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health Emerita at New York University, noted the new study is correlational and shows association, not causation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000n356mg3fy4i7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even so, it’s consistent with decades of evidence linking saturated fat to health risks and demonstrating quite substantial health benefits of substituting plant oils (including seed oils) for animal fats,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000o356m6d545vqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seed oils are derived from plant seeds, whereas plant-based oils are extracted from a variety of different plant parts. All oils examined in the study fall under the seed oil category, except for olive oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000p356mq8b1stpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Olive oil, canola oil, and soybean oil were each more consistently associated with benefit: a lower risk of dying,” said cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “These findings add to a large body of scientific literature on the health benefits of these plant oils, whose positive effects have been demonstrated in both large observational studies and dozens of randomized trials.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkpcl000i356mkz8st1d4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study indicates that some plant oils lead to better health outcomes, Zhang clarified that this doesn’t mean butter should be eliminated altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000w356m8u6hel68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are not suggesting that people should avoid butter entirely, but we are recommending that even a small reduction in butter in replacement for plant-based oils in a daily diet could lead to very substantial, long-term health benefits,” Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000x356m3aaqlpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The choice to use butter may depend on available options for the consumer, Willett said. If given the choice between butter and a partially hydrogenated plant oil rich in trans fats, he said, butter might be a better option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000z356mzaex96bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat#:~:text=Final%20Determination%20Regarding%20Partially%20Hydrogenated%20Oils%20(Removing%20Trans%20Fat),-Share&amp;amp;text=In%202015%2C%20FDA%20released%20its,levels%20in%20other%20edible%20oils." target="_blank"&gt;2015 ban&lt;/a&gt; on trans fats passed by the US Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers can still use up to a half of gram of trans fat per serving. That can add up fast in a daily diet, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114#:~:text=Products%20made%20before%20the%20FDA,amount%20is%20below%200.5%20grams." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0010356mcfr8z6l5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, if the decision is between butter and beef tallow — which has been promoted by Kennedy as a healthier substitute for seed oils — canola, soybean and olive oils are the superior choice, Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0011356mo6ehh0v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although beef tallow was not examined in this study, on the basis of its composition we would expect it to be no better than butter,” Willett said, pointing to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5081717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; he authored that found fat from red meat, which is mostly composed of beef fat, was marginally worse than dairy fat in regards to mortality or cardiovascular disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0012356m3cne1pjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is very high in saturated fat, approximately 2/3 of the fat, and it contains almost none of the beneficial, essential polysaturated fats,” Willett said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0013356m48apf9rn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our findings don’t mean that we should never consume butter, but it is best to use it just when its specific flavor is important, not as a primary source of fat,” he added. “For me, this is the several times a year that I have lobster … butter is absolutely essential!”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhlde3000u356m2zy31gqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re looking to make the switch to plant oils or debating which ones to use, it’s all about finding a balance to include some of the essential nutrients your body needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001a356m7175xqrq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Olive, canola and soybean oils had the most beneficial impact on health outcomes in the study, according to Zhang, which comes from their high levels of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s maintain the body’s cells, provide energy, maintain immune defense and reduce inflammation when it’s at optimal levels (like most things, too much omega-3 &lt;a href="https://news.oregonstate.edu/news/excess-omega-3-fatty-acids-could-lead-negative-health-effects" target="_blank"&gt;may be harmful&lt;/a&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001b356m9h2fmamr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other seed oils such as corn, peanut, safflower and sunflower contain higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids, which are also necessary to maintain good health.&lt;br&gt;Omega-6 molecules stimulate hair and skin growth, regulate metabolism, support bone health, and in some cases, may even have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/fish-oil-heart-wellness/index.html"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xix6es00053b6mvx4hnm61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, omega-6s can also be converted into molecules such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3081099/#:~:text=Prostaglandins%20play%20a%20key%20role,cardinal%20signs%20of%20acute%20inflammation." target="_blank"&gt;prostaglandins&lt;/a&gt; that signal the initiation of inflammation — not a bad thing when your body is trying to quickly repel an invader or tumor, but devastating if left smoldering for long periods without resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001d356mrajvtkds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Americans have an overabundance of omega-6s in their bodies due to their use in ultraprocessed foods and eating at fast food establishments. One omega 6, &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/omega-6-fatty-acids" target="_blank"&gt;linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#reference78" target="_blank"&gt;most common omega-6&lt;/a&gt; in the US food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001c356mrl6nbie5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids; soybean and canola oil have both,” Willett said. “Corn and sunflower oil have very little omega-3 fatty content; these can be part of a mix of different oils, but should not be relied upon as a sole source of plant oil.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001e356m8op9xti9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No matter which oils you’re using in your diet, it’s best to use them sparingly, Nestle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001f356ma260ua5p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m always for varying food intake to the extent possible and that goes for oils, as well,” she said.  “All oils, no matter which, provide about 120 calories per tablespoon so are best used in the proverbial moderation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Unlike previous BCIs, which lasted only a few days, this AI-enhanced device worked reliably for seven months.

Until now, such devices have only worked for a day or two.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108079"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man and a robotic hand." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ai-robotic-hand-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Ganguly is now refining the AI models to make the robotic arm move faster and more smoothly, and planning to test the BCI in a home environment.   Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BCI relies on an AI model that can adjust to the small changes that take place in the brain as a person repeats a movement – or in this case, an imagined movement – and learns to do it in a more refined way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This blending of learning between humans and AI is the next phase for these brain-computer interfaces,” said neurologist, Karunesh Ganguly, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology and a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. “It’s what we need to achieve sophisticated, lifelike function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, appears March 6 in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key was the discovery of how activity shifts in the brain day to day as a study participant repeatedly imagined making specific movements. Once the AI was programmed to account for those shifts, it worked for months at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location, location, location &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly studied how patterns of brain activity in animals represent specific movements and saw that these representations changed day-to-day as the animal learned. He suspected the same thing was happening in humans, and that was why their BCIs so quickly lost the ability to recognize these patterns.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly and neurology researcher Nikhilesh Natraj, PhD, worked with a study participant who had been paralyzed by a stroke years earlier. He could not speak or move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had tiny sensors implanted on the surface of his brain that could pick up brain activity when he imagined moving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see whether his brain patterns changed over time, Ganguly asked the participant to imagine moving different parts of his body, like his hands, feet or head. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although he couldn’t actually move, the participant’s brain could still produce the signals for a movement when he imagined himself doing it. The BCI recorded the brain’s representations of these movements through the sensors on his brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly’s team found that the shape of representations in the brain stayed the same, but their locations shifted slightly from day to day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From virtual to reality &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly then asked the participant to imagine himself making simple movements with his fingers, hands or thumbs over the course of two weeks, while the sensors recorded his brain activity to train the AI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the participant tried to control a robotic arm and hand. But the movements still weren’t very precise.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Ganguly had the participant practice on a virtual robot arm that gave him feedback on the accuracy of his visualizations. Eventually, he got the virtual arm to do what he wanted it to do.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the participant began practicing with the real robot arm, it only took a few practice sessions for him to transfer his skills to the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could make the robotic arm pick up blocks, turn them and move them to new locations. He was even able to open a cabinet, take out a cup and hold it up to a water dispenser.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months later, the participant was still able to control the robotic arm after a 15-minute “tune-up” to adjust for how his movement representations had drifted since he had begun using the device.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly is now refining the AI models to make the robotic arm move faster and more smoothly, and planning to test the BCI in a home environment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with paralysis, the ability to feed themselves or get a drink of water would be life changing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ganguly thinks this is within reach.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very confident that we’ve learned how to build the system now, and that we can make this work,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other authors of this study include Sarah Seko and Adelyn Tu-Chan of UCSF and Reza Abiri of the University of Rhode Island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (1 DP2 HD087955) and the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and robotics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#65170a070c0b4b0804170e1625100616034b000110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robin Marks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robin Marks – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.02.001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sampling representational plasticity of simple imagined movements across days enables long-term neuroprosthetic control&lt;/a&gt;” by Karunesh Ganguly et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sampling representational plasticity of simple imagined movements across days enables long-term neuroprosthetic control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system needs to balance the stability of neural representations with plasticity. It is unclear what the representational stability of simple well-rehearsed actions is, particularly in humans, and their adaptability to new contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an electrocorticography brain-computer interface (BCI) in tetraplegic participants, we found that the low-dimensional manifold and relative representational distances for a repertoire of simple imagined movements were remarkably stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The manifold’s absolute location, however, demonstrated constrained day-to-day drift. Strikingly, neural statistics, especially variance, could be flexibly regulated to increase representational distances during BCI control without somatotopic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discernability strengthened with practice and was BCI-specific, demonstrating contextual specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling representational plasticity and drift across days subsequently uncovered a meta-representational structure with generalizable decision boundaries for the repertoire; this allowed long-term neuroprosthetic control of a robotic arm and hand for reaching and grasping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study offers insights into mesoscale representational statistics that also enable long-term complex neuroprosthetic control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:55:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE0yOXBTR09fTHo5Zm10c2F6SVFQSDlYNHBMTVpiQXNjcVp6RmZGZUFsQWNtUzZtNVM5YldnUVJpaVluUnJzTGViWmdEN19NckhFNTZ1R0N5cDF0RmNienB4Qm1PQ3JxVDFxRGQxdzlKMA</guid></item><item><title>The Real-Life Diet of a Harvard and MIT Scientist Who Says the Right Diet Can Make You Smarter - GQ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1iUjdCY09BVTRtTng0VV9NYWU4U3lkd1Y2cko4ZFA4RWt3LTIxMHZadWZJWDQ5RnFJeElSLUZBYVVjVm1ILWdJZG0yQ2pOQTFDM2FTNk56dHBsTDI3M2RXeF9LLVo?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Omega-6 fatty acids, which are present in nuts and seeds and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7596305/"&gt;are essential for brain development&lt;/a&gt; and health, must be consumed in balance with Omega-3s to support overall well-being. Excessive consumption of Omega-6 fatty acids relative to Omega-3s has been associated with inflammation and various health issues, so balance is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-9 fatty acids—which you can find in olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds—though not essential&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33054628/"&gt;, can contribute to cognitive function and cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt; when included in a diet rich in diverse fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;What other foods top the list of being “the best” for brain health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods loaded with antioxidants&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/foods-linked-to-better-brainpower"&gt;, including berries and leafy green vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, safeguard the brain against oxidative stress, thereby improving brain efficiency and promoting healthy aging. Additionally, whole grains and vitamin E-rich foods, such as nuts and seeds, are important for vascular health, which is essential for optimal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Are there specific foods that can help people improve specific brain functions, like concentration and memory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain foods have a significant effect on memory and concentration, primarily due to their rich nutrient profiles. Omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins found in foods like fatty fish, berries, and leafy greens aid in boosting brain function, enhancing memory, and staving off cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;I’m afraid to ask… but what’s the deal with coffee?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foods that enhance focus, &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/coffee-obsession"&gt;such as those with caffeine and L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;—which are present in coffee and green tea—enhance alertness and attention by influencing neurotransmitter dynamics. I usually only drink coffee once or twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;This is terrible, but not unexpected, news. What’s the alternative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for green tea as an alternative to coffee is generally a good idea. Green tea is rich in caffeine, known to boost alertness and concentration, and also contains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/theanine#:~:text=Oral%20supplementation%20with%2050%E2%80%93200,serotonin%2C%20dopamine%20and%20other%20neurotransmitters."&gt;L-theanine, which supports a state of calm alertness&lt;/a&gt;, possibly enhancing focus while reducing feelings of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;What else do you avoid in your diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I minimize sugar intake—although I do enjoy a piece of chocolate a couple of times a week—and I only eat red meat once or twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Do…I need to do that too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support brain health, it's advisable to limit intake of processed and high-sugar foods (like sugary beverages, candy, cupcakes—all things we stuff ourselves with as children and habituate as comfort foods!), as they can impair cognitive function and memory. Consumption of alcohol and red meats has also been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071474/"&gt;linked to negative impacts on brain health&lt;/a&gt;. Foods high in saturated and trans fats should also be minimized, as they can lead to decreased brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Does &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat make a difference in all of this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a profound link between your dietary habits and your brain's health. The science is really just in its infancy for this—and there appears to be a “no one-case fits all”—so people need to experiment to find what works best for them. Having said this, patterns are emerging. Consuming meals at regular, consistent times helps regulate the body's internal clock, stabilizing blood sugar levels and ensuring a steady supply of energy to the brain, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive functions and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;So, where does intermittent fasting come into play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermittent fasting, which involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, has been shown to benefit brain health. This practice may enhance brain function by reducing oxidative stress, improving brain cell growth, and decreasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the optimal intervals for eating can vary depending on individual health conditions, lifestyle, and dietary needs. Generally, fasting for 14 or more hours a day is recommended (so, for example, finish dinner by 6 p.m. and have breakfast at 8 a.m.), but it's important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best eating schedule for your specific health goals and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;Any other secrets we need to know about how to hack our diets to get smarter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with adaptogens—which are natural substances that typically come from an herb, root, or mushroom. I’ve been exploring lion’s mane, chaga, reishi, and maca for their potential benefits for enhancing resilience to stress and supporting overall well-being. Incorporating these adaptogens into my routine has been part of my journey to optimize mental clarity, energy levels, and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:53:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1iUjdCY09BVTRtTng0VV9NYWU4U3lkd1Y2cko4ZFA4RWt3LTIxMHZadWZJWDQ5RnFJeElSLUZBYVVjVm1ILWdJZG0yQ2pOQTFDM2FTNk56dHBsTDI3M2RXeF9LLVo</guid></item><item><title>Second death reported in growing measles outbreak - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOY1lRQWNtOU9zcnpsRWpiaXZ4Z0xQdXFtNW1iTzlqVFljb3NnbTVLc0FpbGQzWGozajRMenRCTEdLelFUZ0ROT0hRbGxRS3FOeDZoZmpZNERLdDN1dUVRVzU4cVNZdElwR0V6THREQWZNeTgtUXB6Rkl0MnRzN0VWclFBbzRUeEN3NTdB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L73LRL7EZZHY7HNNLDR6WTT5UI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An unvaccinated New Mexico adult who tested positive for measles has died, the second death in a growing measles outbreak centered along the West Texas-New Mexico border, officials said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6P67KWGWOBADFL4AITF2AILPYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The individual did not seek medical care before death, New Mexico health department officials said.

&lt;p&gt;The resurgence of avian flu at two animal slaughter markets in Queens has renewed urgent calls to shut down New York City’s densely packed wet markets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest outbreaks come just weeks after a temporary closure in February, when an undercover investigation by &lt;a href="https://nyclass.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NYCLASS&lt;/a&gt; and Council Member Robert Holden revealed squalid conditions at live animal markets in Queens and Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DGYXSW_JoV9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;disturbing footage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; was captured after the markets were temporarily closed for five days in February due to a previous avian flu outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="emp-d4473" class="emp-ad-article-leaderboard"&gt;

They’re stuffed into cages and are literally on top of each other,” remarked Holden, who represents the District 30 neighborhoods of &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/ridgewood/"&gt;Ridgewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/maspeth/"&gt;Maspeth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/middle-village/"&gt;Middle Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/glendale/"&gt;Glendale,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/elmhurst/"&gt;Elmhurst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://qns.com/neighborhoods/rego-park/"&gt;Rego Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-J2ZCYteD" data-type="float"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The outbreaks have sparked further alarm among animal rights activists, public health officials, and concerned citizens, who argue that such markets are unsafe to operate amid a bird flu crisis. Advocates have called for immediate and indefinite closure of these markets until proper control measures are in place to address both animal welfare and public health concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="emp-ed36b" class="amp-action"&gt;    
                        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;NYCLASS Executive Director Edita Birnkrant has been vocal in her criticism of the state’s response, accusing Gov. Kathy Hochul of failing to take adequate action. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Birnkrant emphasized that these latest outbreaks should serve as a clear indication that operating these markets during a bird flu outbreak is reckless and puts public health at risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She called on Governor Hochul to shut down the markets indefinitely, pointing out that allowing them to remain open amidst the ongoing crisis contributes to the spread of avian flu and other infectious diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One of the major concerns raised by advocates is the lack of transparency regarding which markets were affected by the avian flu outbreaks. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Health officials have not disclosed which specific slaughter markets had confirmed cases, leaving the public in the dark about potential exposure. Without this information, consumers are left uncertain whether the poultry they purchase could be infected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512998" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512998" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?w=363" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg 828w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=363,700 363w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=768,1482 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=622,1200 622w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=796,1536 796w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=199,384 199w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=466,900 466w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_2942.jpeg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512998" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Birds with open wounds were still stuffed in overcrowded cages in this wet market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;via Instagram @nyclass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Birnkrant argued that this lack of accountability is unacceptable and amounts to malpractice on the part of health agencies and government officials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to the avian flu outbreaks, NYCLASS has documented troubling conditions at live markets in Queens and Brooklyn. The organization has reported overcrowded cages containing sick and injured birds, many showing signs of infection, including necrotic wounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Often overcrowded and unsanitary, these markets have long been a source of concern for animal rights groups. Birds at these markets are typically kept in appalling conditions, leading to a variety of health issues, including infections and injuries. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advocates argue that these markets not only endanger the animals but also create an environment where zoonotic diseases, like avian flu, can easily spread.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The situation is further compounded by reports of hazardous conditions on public streets near the markets. NYCLASS captured footage of an open dumpster dripping with blood and filled with bags of rotting chickens, many of which were torn open with feathers scattered about. The lack of sanitation and safety protocols for both the animals and the public is a major point of concern. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People shopping at these markets are exposed to close contact with sick animals without any personal protective equipment (PPE) or safety measures. According to experts, this creates an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, including avian flu.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Veterinarians and public health experts have also weighed in on the risks posed by these markets. Dr. Crystal Heath, a veterinarian, pointed out that live markets, which allow for direct interaction between the public and stressed animals, are breeding grounds for disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With thousands of people coming into close contact with sick or stressed animals, the conditions are ripe for an influenza virus to jump to humans. The close quarters, lack of sanitation, and high-stress levels among the animals significantly increase the likelihood of disease transmission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512991" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512991" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512991" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg 1024w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=700,468 700w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=384,257 384w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=900,602 900w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197691041.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512991" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Markets were temporarily shut down in New York in February due to bird flu. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol /Anadolu via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Additionally, Dr. Heath noted that such environments increase the risk of avian flu reassorting with the seasonal flu, potentially creating a virus with pandemic potential.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The health risks extend beyond avian flu, as animals in these markets are often exposed to various bacterial infections, respiratory diseases, and other health issues due to overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal rights organizations like Woodstock Farm Sanctuary have also expressed concern, sharing their experiences with animals rescued from these markets. The sanctuary has taken in numerous animals directly sourced from New York City’s live markets. Upon examination, many of them have shown signs of infections, neglect, and untreated health issues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of the animals rescued were so severely compromised that they passed away shortly after their rescue. The conditions these animals endure, both in the markets and in transport, are a major concern for organizations advocating for animal welfare.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Furthermore, concerns have been raised about the lack of testing and oversight on factory farms, where many of the birds sold in these markets are sourced. Critics have pointed out that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/news/new-york-state-announces-further-proactive-measures-prevent-avian-influenza-live-bird-markets#:~:text=New%20York%20State%20Agriculture%20Commissioner,York's%20poultry%20as%20well%20as" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;testing a small sample of birds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; from massive factory farms and declaring them free of avian influenza is insufficient and irresponsible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The overcrowded conditions at these farms not only contribute to the spread of avian flu but also result in a host of other health problems for the birds. Animal rights activists argue that the lack of proper regulation and oversight at both factory farms and live slaughter markets is contributing to the ongoing crisis and putting both animal and public health in jeopardy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_512992" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-512992" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-512992" src="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?w=700" alt="" srcset="https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg 1024w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=700,467 700w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=384,256 384w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://qns.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-2197690939.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-512992" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="image-caption"&gt;Advocates are calling for the complete shutdown of these overcrowded and unsanitary markets. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="image-credit"&gt;Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol /Anadolu via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In light of the continuing outbreaks and the evidence of hazardous conditions, calls for the permanent closure of these markets have grown louder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;John Di Leonardo, President of &lt;a href="https://www.humanelongisland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Humane Long Island&lt;/a&gt;, warns that failure to take immediate action could lead to the spread of diseases with far-reaching consequences for public health. Just as COVID-19 originated in live markets, avian flu presents a much greater risk, with the potential for devastating consequences if the virus were to mutate or spread further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, there are currently no human cases of avian flu, and the threat to the public is still low.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Following continued proactive surveillance of NYC’s live bird markets, Department inspectors detected HPAI in two live bird markets in Queens. Results were later confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL),” the Department of Agriculture and Market stated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Both markets immediately closed and completed depopulation, cleaning, and disinfection and will now remain closed for a period of five days. They will be allowed to reopen following an additional inspection. In order to protect impacted businesses and farms, the Department releases county-level information regarding HPAI detections and not the names of the businesses.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Animal welfare groups, health professionals, and concerned citizens continue to urge Gov. Hochul and city officials to act swiftly to close these markets and implement stricter regulations to ensure the safety of both the animals and the public. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers compared young and old rats fed a diet with 60% of calories from fat and found that only the older rats showed cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While metabolic and gut health changes took months to appear, memory deficits emerged quickly in the aged brains. The findings suggest that diet-related brain inflammation is not solely driven by obesity but occurs rapidly with unhealthy eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just three days of a high-fat diet caused memory impairment in older rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain inflammation occurred before metabolic and gut health changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Young rats on the same diet did not experience cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Just a few days of eating a diet high in saturated fat could be enough to cause memory problems and related brain inflammation in older adults, a new study in rats suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers fed separate groups of young and old rats the high-fat diet for three days or for three months to compare how quickly changes happen in the brain versus the rest of the body when eating an unhealthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108071"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two brains and fast food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/fast-food-dementia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Young rats’ memory and behavior and brain tissue remained unaffected by the fatty food. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected based on previous diabetes and obesity research, eating fatty foods for three months led to metabolic problems, gut inflammation and dramatic shifts in gut bacteria in all rats compared to those that ate normal chow, while just three days of high fat caused no major metabolic or gut changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to changes in the brain, however, researchers found that only older rats – whether they were on the high-fat diet for three months or only three days – performed poorly on memory tests and showed negative inflammatory changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results dispel the idea that diet-related inflammation in the aging brain is driven by obesity, said senior study author Ruth Barrientos, an investigator in the Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research at The Ohio State University. Most research on the effects of fatty and processed foods on the brain has focused on obesity, yet the impact of unhealthy eating, independent of obesity, remains largely unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unhealthy diets and obesity are linked, but they are not inseparable. We’re really looking for the effects of the diet directly on the brain. And we showed that within three days, long before obesity sets in, tremendous neuroinflammatory shifts are occurring,” said Barrientos, also an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral health and neuroscience in Ohio State’s College of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in the body in all animals are happening more slowly and aren’t actually necessary to cause the memory impairments and changes in the brain. We never would have known that brain inflammation is the primary cause of high-fat diet-induced memory impairments without comparing the two timelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published recently in the journal &lt;em&gt;Immunity &amp;amp; Ageing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of research in Barrientos’ lab has suggested that aging brings on long-term “priming” of the brain’s inflammatory profile coupled with a loss of brain-cell reserve to bounce back, and that an unhealthy diet can make matters worse for the brain in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat constitutes 60% of calories in the high-fat diet used in the study, which could equate to a range of common fast-food options: For example, nutrition data shows that fat makes up about 60% of calories in a McDonald’s double smoky BLT quarter pounder with cheese or a Burger King double whopper with cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the animals were on high-fat diets for three days or three months, researchers ran tests assessing two types of memory problems common in older people with dementia that are based in separate regions of the brain: contextual memory mediated by the hippocampus (the primary memory center of the brain), and cued-fear memory that originates in the amygdala (the fear and danger center of the brain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to control animals eating chow and young rats on the high-fat diet, aged rats showed behaviors indicating both types of memory were impaired after only three days of fatty food – and the behaviors persisted as they continued on the high-fat diet for three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also saw changes in levels of a range of proteins called cytokines in the brains of aged rats after three days of fatty food, which signaled a dysregulated inflammatory response. Three months after being on the high-fat diet, some of the cytokine levels had shifted but remained dysregulated, and the cognitive problems persisted in behavior tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A departure from baseline inflammatory markers is a negative response and has been shown to impair learning and memory functions,” Barrientos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to rats eating normal chow, young and old animals gained more weight and showed signs of metabolic dysfunction – poor insulin and blood sugar control, inflammatory proteins in fat (adipose) tissue, and gut microbiome alterations – after three months on the high-fat diet. Young rats’ memory and behavior and brain tissue remained unaffected by the fatty food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These diets lead to obesity-related changes in both young and old animals, yet young animals appear more resilient to the high-fat diet’s effects on memory. We think it is likely due to their ability to activate compensatory anti-inflammatory responses, which the aged animals lack,” Barrientos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, with glucose, insulin and adipose inflammation all increased in both young and old animals, there’s no way to distinguish what is causing memory impairment in only old animals if you look only at what’s happening in the body. It’s what is happening in the brain that’s important for the memory response.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by grants from the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors include Michael Butler, Stephanie Muscat, Brigitte González Olmo, Sabrina Mackey-Alfonso, Nashali Massa, Bryan Alvarez, Jade Blackwell, Menaz Bettes and James DeMarsh of Ohio State; and Maria Elisa Caetano-Silva, Akriti Shrestha, Robert McCusker and Jacob Allen of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3556545951425059591b040004755a46401b505140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emily Caldwell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://osu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emily Caldwell – Ohio State University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12979-024-00496-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Obesity-associated memory impairment and neuroinflammation precede widespread peripheral perturbations in aged rats&lt;/a&gt;” by Ruth Barrientos et al. &lt;em&gt;Immunity &amp;amp; Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obesity-associated memory impairment and neuroinflammation precede widespread peripheral perturbations in aged rats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity and metabolic syndrome are major public health concerns linked to cognitive decline with aging. Prior work from our lab has demonstrated that short-term high fat diet (HFD) rapidly impairs memory function via a neuroinflammatory mechanism. However, the degree to which these rapid inflammatory changes are unique to the brain is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, deviations in gut microbiome composition have been associated with obesity and cognitive impairment, but how diet and aging interact to impact the gut microbiome, or how rapidly these changes occur, is less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, our study investigated the impact of HFD after two distinct consumption durations: 3 months (to model diet-induced obesity) or 3 days (to detect the rapid changes occurring with HFD) on memory function, anxiety-like behavior, central and peripheral inflammation, and gut microbiome profile in young and aged rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data indicated that both short-term and long-term HFD consumption impaired memory function and increased anxiety-like behavior in aged, but not young adult, rats. These behavioral changes were accompanied by pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation in the hippocampus and amygdala of aged HFD-fed rats at both time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, changes to fasting glucose, insulin, and inflammation in peripheral tissues such as the distal colon and visceral adipose tissue were increased in young and aged rats only after long-term, but not short-term, HFD consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, while subtle HFD-induced changes to the gut microbiome did occur rapidly, robust age-specific effects were only present following long-term HFD consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these data suggest that HFD-evoked neuroinflammation, memory impairment, and anxiety-like behavior in aging develop quicker than, and separately from the peripheral hallmarks of diet-induced obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 21:20:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBFWDhIVFFqSWJPQWlla2FKLTBHOFAzR1hHaHp2cnFCVzU1Z1d2MVN6bGxCZUJIZkpaRWZhZENkdENTcTZlcmdGVXc4RGZ6b2xFcUFtTjNucndKVDR0WlJPMnNGY3FPcld5M1hQN0xhOA</guid></item><item><title>Switching butter for some plant-based oils significantly reduces risk of death, new study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPQnk1RTFEenItU0dMeERud3RSLXNiOGs3S0d4LWtRX3BaTndQUl9ZREdPMzAyN0J0OUNuX0JMd1RQeU80S3hZNlppWVBucUhFbDJEQTAtNkN0VWVXeG5rU3JlLWxJMVVqbWJrX3hDNXpHNzA5eHEybnkyeURpYVpGUzJDWHZLX2tlY29rTmlRdjE5Z9IBiAFBVV95cUxNNG9OYWdLNGhJeG9oY1Btd1BpRlpQa2owZWpZOFhwSEFieHRxM0liMko3Wk5FVzRTcWdvWmZBYzR3eFlKQ3JzVURSQ254WFhDSFFnWVBFMVZ6eFZKQ0h6WndnbncwWkxmU01rOFkzbU9tYlZ2SkVQc2FEdkhHY3lhVFU3OVpjSnVI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Swapping your daily butter intake for certain plant-based oils may help reduce your risk of death, a new study finds.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjev90004356m0egwvwuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These findings challenge the growing social media trend that attacks seed oils in favor of butter, ghee and animal fats.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0005356m42wka6r9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seed oils are one of the most unhealthy ingredients we have in foods,” said US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertfkennedyjr/reel/DBkBhZPRH6d/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram video&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, who continues to promote the slogan “Making Frying Oil Tallow Again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0006356mewioqm1u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many other influencers have supported similar claims, including Dr. Paul Saladino, who promotes an animal-based diet and has amassed 2.6 million Instagram followers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0007356mp20ixo40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is a health food with amazing nutrients,” he said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulsaladinomd/reel/Cr6QPD9PWn_/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;in a post&lt;/a&gt;, adding that butter is good for the gut, brain, cardiovascular health, and overall health and vitality.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0008356mg7148zvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The evidence doesn’t support that view, according to study coauthor Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva0009356m4x5tats5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For some reason that is not clear to me, a myth has been floating around the internet that butter is a healthy fat, but there is no good evidence to support this,” said Willett, who has authored over 2,000 articles and numerous books and has spent 40 years studying the impact of diet on the development of major diseases, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000a356m7uk6ei5z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Willett and his team’s latest research revealed that higher butter consumption was associated with a 15% higher risk of mortality, whereas higher intake of plant-based oils — including soybean, canola and olive oil — was linked to a 16% reduction in total mortality, according to the study published Thursday in the journal &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0205" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In addition, substituting just 10 grams (0.35 ounces) of butter with these plant-based oils daily was associated with a 17% lower risk of both total mortality and cancer-related deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhjeva000c356m274bxo9l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Seventeen percent is quite a big change, especially when you look at the public health perspective,” said Dr. Yu Zhang, study coauthor and researcher at the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “Imagine how many deaths we can reduce in the general population.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

            The study analyzed 33 years of dietary data from more than 221,000 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II) and Health Professionals Follow-up Study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000k356mkebc0v24@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Participants self-reported their dietary habits every four years, allowing researchers to track changes over time and calculate long-term intake averages. Researchers adjusted their findings to account for variables such as age, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total calorie intake, as well as other dietary patterns using the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/evaluating-adherence-to-recommended-diets-in-adults-the-alternate-healthy-eating-index/1163D3C29653628A1209EB88AE166BF1" target="_blank"&gt;Alternative Healthy Eating Index&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000l356mq21xx4jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Butter intake included any amount used in cooking and baking, as well as any extra butter spread on food. Plant-based oil consumption was estimated based on the type of oil used in frying, sautéing, baking or making salad dressings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000m356mbqoxvqnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Marion Nestle, Paulette Goddard Professor of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health Emerita at New York University, noted the new study is correlational and shows association, not causation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000n356mg3fy4i7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Even so, it’s consistent with decades of evidence linking saturated fat to health risks and demonstrating quite substantial health benefits of substituting plant oils (including seed oils) for animal fats,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000o356m6d545vqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seed oils are derived from plant seeds, whereas plant-based oils are extracted from a variety of different plant parts. All oils examined in the study fall under the seed oil category, except for olive oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkqmq000p356mq8b1stpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Olive oil, canola oil, and soybean oil were each more consistently associated with benefit: a lower risk of dying,” said cardiologist Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food is Medicine Institute at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University. “These findings add to a large body of scientific literature on the health benefits of these plant oils, whose positive effects have been demonstrated in both large observational studies and dozens of randomized trials.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhkpcl000i356mkz8st1d4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the study indicates that some plant oils lead to better health outcomes, Zhang clarified that this doesn’t mean butter should be eliminated altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000w356m8u6hel68@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are not suggesting that people should avoid butter entirely, but we are recommending that even a small reduction in butter in replacement for plant-based oils in a daily diet could lead to very substantial, long-term health benefits,” Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000x356m3aaqlpde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The choice to use butter may depend on available options for the consumer, Willett said. If given the choice between butter and a partially hydrogenated plant oil rich in trans fats, he said, butter might be a better option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio000z356mzaex96bf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Despite the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/final-determination-regarding-partially-hydrogenated-oils-removing-trans-fat#:~:text=Final%20Determination%20Regarding%20Partially%20Hydrogenated%20Oils%20(Removing%20Trans%20Fat),-Share&amp;amp;text=In%202015%2C%20FDA%20released%20its,levels%20in%20other%20edible%20oils." target="_blank"&gt;2015 ban&lt;/a&gt; on trans fats passed by the US Food and Drug Administration, manufacturers can still use up to a half of gram of trans fat per serving. That can add up fast in a daily diet, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114#:~:text=Products%20made%20before%20the%20FDA,amount%20is%20below%200.5%20grams." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0010356mcfr8z6l5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, if the decision is between butter and beef tallow — which has been promoted by Kennedy as a healthier substitute for seed oils — canola, soybean and olive oils are the superior choice, Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0011356mo6ehh0v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although beef tallow was not examined in this study, on the basis of its composition we would expect it to be no better than butter,” Willett said, pointing to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5081717/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"&gt;previous analysis&lt;/a&gt; he authored that found fat from red meat, which is mostly composed of beef fat, was marginally worse than dairy fat in regards to mortality or cardiovascular disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0012356m3cne1pjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Butter is very high in saturated fat, approximately 2/3 of the fat, and it contains almost none of the beneficial, essential polysaturated fats,” Willett said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhleio0013356m48apf9rn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our findings don’t mean that we should never consume butter, but it is best to use it just when its specific flavor is important, not as a primary source of fat,” he added. “For me, this is the several times a year that I have lobster … butter is absolutely essential!”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhlde3000u356m2zy31gqz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you’re looking to make the switch to plant oils or debating which ones to use, it’s all about finding a balance to include some of the essential nutrients your body needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001a356m7175xqrq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Olive, canola and soybean oils had the most beneficial impact on health outcomes in the study, according to Zhang, which comes from their high levels of anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3s maintain the body’s cells, provide energy, maintain immune defense and reduce inflammation when it’s at optimal levels (like most things, too much omega-3 &lt;a href="https://news.oregonstate.edu/news/excess-omega-3-fatty-acids-could-lead-negative-health-effects" target="_blank"&gt;may be harmful&lt;/a&gt;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001b356m9h2fmamr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other seed oils such as corn, peanut, safflower and sunflower contain higher levels of omega-6 fatty acids, which are also necessary to maintain good health.&lt;br&gt;Omega-6 molecules stimulate hair and skin growth, regulate metabolism, support bone health, and in some cases, may even have &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/fish-oil-heart-wellness/index.html"&gt;anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xix6es00053b6mvx4hnm61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, omega-6s can also be converted into molecules such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3081099/#:~:text=Prostaglandins%20play%20a%20key%20role,cardinal%20signs%20of%20acute%20inflammation." target="_blank"&gt;prostaglandins&lt;/a&gt; that signal the initiation of inflammation — not a bad thing when your body is trying to quickly repel an invader or tumor, but devastating if left smoldering for long periods without resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7xhm0wn001d356mrajvtkds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Americans have an overabundance of omega-6s in their bodies due to their use in ultraprocessed foods and eating at fast food establishments. One omega 6, &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/omega-6-fatty-acids" target="_blank"&gt;linoleic acid&lt;/a&gt;, is the &lt;a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/essential-fatty-acids#reference78" target="_blank"&gt;most common omega-6&lt;/a&gt; in the US food supply.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We need both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids; soybean and canola oil have both,” Willett said. “Corn and sunflower oil have very little omega-3 fatty content; these can be part of a mix of different oils, but should not be relied upon as a sole source of plant oil.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            No matter which oils you’re using in your diet, it’s best to use them sparingly, Nestle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I’m always for varying food intake to the extent possible and that goes for oils, as well,” she said.  “All oils, no matter which, provide about 120 calories per tablespoon so are best used in the proverbial moderation.”

Still, she says, “I was more worried about what they were going to have to do to get rid of [the cancer] and the surgery itself. This was scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am very grateful that I caught it at stage zero and it was localized.

Sunscreen “does not protect against subungual (under the nail) squamous cell carcinoma, a rare but potentially aggressive form of skin cancer” that differs from the type of cancer Tagliamonte developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;If getting a regular manicure, the safest bet is to allow nails to air-dry naturally, avoiding the drying lamps altogether or use an air blower or fan without UV lights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/fast-spreading-cancer-on-thumb-two-black-lines-11692199" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:46:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTFBabUhhNHNqbzEyVG9neE1ETWhFYVItYWRGbFR4NnE5eHl4eE00M0EzMFExNWdoZFRoSDF6WVd5ZEp3TVZJdHBVWU15Z2g0MkFCQ203LXRpSGRfTGVicU5KdlpzN1J3dzZXLVZieWlsTjJwRjA</guid></item><item><title>Easy-to-dismiss symptom that experts warn could be a sign of deadly motor neurone disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNTUZZNF9oVHNYZzJuaDI3eGd0Zy1xMjAwUWt3QU5tQkhTM01NR2R5T3BTanBhdDBJX3ZsUGtxYWtfU3Vpd2o1Wm0zR00xNVZVcWd2dXJHSzIyRlVhYi1TMmtTUVZ5d25pV2tNSklza2lod2JWRFUyVWVDVHFsUEtoRjNqdFNZTVg2aTRhelV4SVhTWnZETUHSAZsBQVVfeXFMT1h1aFBGQS05aGgyakJwNTU4aDZtdjlSRGtLUTU3Z182Zk0tdkdTUnJfal9ESGNiT0l0Wm9iWmIxdmRYWDByRTl0N0k1aklLMEVyNHJxTjdKTzUzbjNzeVBhVGZOM3YwZTJDVlVvZHltSV8tNHRIbkNVMWQ5WmU1V0w5Ykt5M2VRR1duU2MxemlJLWZxTDJsdm1xREk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that difficulty swallowing, producing excess saliva or even drooling could be a sign of &lt;span&gt;motor neurone disease (MND). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The progressive condition affects the brain and nerves that eventually robs sufferers of their ability to move, to eat and eventually breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most patients drooling develops later on in the illness as they become increasingly unable to keep their lips properly sealed or a reduced ability to swallow, rather than direct increased saliva production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also experience excessive, watery saliva or thick, mucousy saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the most common initial symptoms are weakness in the limbs, twitches and difficulty gripping, slurred speech and swallowing issues are also seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2021 study of over 900 Scottish people with MND researchers found that 31 per cent of patients had saliva problems like drooling or excessively thick saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts also found that the symptom is more common in sufferers of bulbar onset MND, a form which mainly affects the muscles in the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Less people have this form of the disease, with an estimated 90 per cent having the more common amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which effects the brain and spinal cord. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rugby League legend Rob Burrow was diagnosed with MND in 2019, before passing away last year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Rugby League star's first symptom was slurred speech, which hit while he was attending an awards show&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While drooling is a little known symptom of MND it is typically not the first sign of the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include stiff or weak hands as well as muscles twitches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS six people are diagnosed with MND every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 5,000 adults in the UK have MND and people have about a one in 300 risk of developing the condition over the course of their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It mainly affects people in there 60s and 70s, but it can affect adults of all ages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Life expectancy for about half of those with the condition is just two to five years from the onset of symptoms. How quickly symptoms get worse varies between patients, it can happen in as little as seven months or years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle twitches and a weak grip are among the early signs of the condition, along with weakness in the leg or ankle, slurred speech and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn that you should see your GP if you have difficulty holding or gripping objects a feeling of weakness in your legs and twitches or muscle cramps that keep happening, if they do not go away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rugby League legend Rob Burrow was diagnosed with MND in 2019, before passing away last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His first symptom was slurred speech, which hit while he was attending an awards show. Friends just thought he was drunk slurring his words but tests revealed the devastating news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently no cure for MND but doctors can provide treatments to help reduce the impact it has on a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics can also provide drugs that minimise the symptoms like drooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, inevitably patients will start to experience problems moving and may need a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As MND progresses patients can eventually need a ventilator, a machine to help them breathe, as well technology to help them communicate.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 20:00:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNTUZZNF9oVHNYZzJuaDI3eGd0Zy1xMjAwUWt3QU5tQkhTM01NR2R5T3BTanBhdDBJX3ZsUGtxYWtfU3Vpd2o1Wm0zR00xNVZVcWd2dXJHSzIyRlVhYi1TMmtTUVZ5d25pV2tNSklza2lod2JWRFUyVWVDVHFsUEtoRjNqdFNZTVg2aTRhelV4SVhTWnZETUHSAZsBQVVfeXFMT1h1aFBGQS05aGgyakJwNTU4aDZtdjlSRGtLUTU3Z182Zk0tdkdTUnJfal9ESGNiT0l0Wm9iWmIxdmRYWDByRTl0N0k1aklLMEVyNHJxTjdKTzUzbjNzeVBhVGZOM3YwZTJDVlVvZHltSV8tNHRIbkNVMWQ5WmU1V0w5Ykt5M2VRR1duU2MxemlJLWZxTDJsdm1xREk</guid></item><item><title>Why eating farmed fish may be safer than eating fish caught in the wild - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQRmJYZERZWnpoZjMxeHhILTRqc0FHWmhDalNKLTVETlQ3LUYta2FiU2VBVWRWLXA0ZVE4RFppaUVuRGR1eVl3YnVwOVNmb0ZnbVphdGk1OUdIYUZPZzNuQ0I1Yjlna3NzTE0zbmQ0eUw1UjkzMHdFT0VRZi1XS0lHZFpqTVI0OUUyYWdjNmFIVHRYemdudVM3LVRWa2w2TWhI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmed fish are often viewed with suspicion, while wild-caught varieties are more likely to be perceived as healthy and pure. Seafood shoppers everywhere debate the differences and weigh their options carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fresh scientific review points to an unexpected conclusion. Various pollutants can accumulate in fish, and wild-caught individuals appear to experience greater exposure to these. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective is shared by &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0001-6007-8622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Isabel  Casanova-Martínez&lt;/a&gt;, a scientist who works under the auspices of several Spanish research institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people recognize that &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/heavy-metal-blood-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heavy metals&lt;/a&gt; pose a threat for food safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These substances include elements like &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/elevated-mercury-levels-discovered-in-dolphins/"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://periodic-table.rsc.org/element/33/arsenic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arsenic&lt;/a&gt;, lead and others that can build up in tissue (bioaccumulate) over time. Certain types can be risky to humans if present in large amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that wild-caught fish carried an average mercury concentration of 0.06 micrograms per gram, while farmed fish had about half that, at 0.038 micrograms per gram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also found arsenic levels of 3.26 micrograms per gram in wild fish, compared with 1.23 micrograms per gram in farmed varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ddt-and-other-pollutants"&gt;DDT and other pollutants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lesser-known concern is &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/ddt-brief-history-and-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DDT&lt;/a&gt;, which was once a widely used pesticide. Even though it was banned in many places years ago, traces can still linger. These residues can find their way into aquatic environments and accumulate in fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review indicates around 196.48 nanograms per gram of DDT in wild-caught samples, whereas farmed fish had about 44.64 nanograms per gram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest differences in how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-small-fish-whole-reduces-cancer-risk-in-women/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; come into contact with old pesticide deposits, possibly due to habitat or feeding patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-some-fish-fare-better"&gt;Why some fish fare better&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fish produced through aquaculture may face stricter oversight in terms of feed and water conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations like the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/publications/fao-flagship-publications/the-state-of-world-fisheries-and-aquaculture/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization&lt;/a&gt; note that this method continues to expand faster than other food sectors. Many producers track feeds and test water more regularly than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy metals can be introduced through industrial pollution, runoff, or other sources in natural waters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filtered tanks or closely monitored pens could mean fewer contaminants find their way into farmed species, although no method removes the risks entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-world-risks-and-caution"&gt;Real-world risks and caution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mercury-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has identified mercury as being among the top chemicals of concern for public health, especially for expectant mothers and small children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High concentrations have been &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/health-effects-exposures-mercury"&gt;tied&lt;/a&gt; to neurological issues and developmental problems in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe daily or weekly seafood intake is still possible, but guidelines vary depending on a person’s overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts often urge pregnant women to be particularly careful about the consumption of large, predatory fish as they are known to harbor elevated mercury levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-balancing-nutrition-and-contaminants"&gt;Balancing nutrition and contaminants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating fish brings many benefits. It offers protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and important minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fishwatch.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NOAA Fisheries&lt;/a&gt; underscores that fish are a valuable food, but also acknowledges that consumers should stay informed about possible contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrients, like &lt;a href="https://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/se.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, vary based on the fish’s environment and diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmed diets often include formulated feeds that are designed to control final nutrient profiles. Wild species gain nutrients from ecosystems that are less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-leading-author-s-viewpoint"&gt;Leading author’s viewpoint&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than pitting wild fishing against aquaculture, our review demonstrates that both sectors can coexist and help meet the world’s seafood needs safely,” concluded Dr. Casanova-Martínez, lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Still, ongoing research and improvements in feed and environmental monitoring are essential for safeguarding public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These observations reflect the broader consensus that both systems are vital for feeding populations. Each approach has benefits and drawbacks that require further attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-regulation-matters"&gt;Why regulation matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory bodies set maximum allowed &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/nearly-100-million-americans-exposed-to-contaminated-drinking-water/"&gt;contaminant levels&lt;/a&gt; to keep consumers safe. Many fish samples in both categories fall within established safety margins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous oversight helps the public gain confidence in what ends up on their plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities also caution special populations. Small children and pregnant individuals may need more careful advice about portion sizes, fish types, and heavy meal frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health agencies need to adjust recommendations when new evidence emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-consumers"&gt;What’s next for consumers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aquaculture often employs best practices to reduce pollutants, yet wild-caught products remain popular for taste and tradition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can choose a balanced approach, selecting a mix of fish sources and staying updated on guidelines for safer consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional studies on feed technology and water filtration are ongoing.

                South African boys from a rural area are briefed by an health worker from Doctors Without Borders before undergoing medical circumcision as a form of HIV prevention. The U.S. has supported male circumcision programs in countries with high rates of HIV. In his address to Congress this week, President Donald Trump listed aid programs that he considers an "appalling waste" and included "$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique."

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/04/g-s1-50488/trump-congress-joint-address-fact-check" target="_blank"&gt;took a jab at a number of foreign aid programs&lt;/a&gt;. "Just listen to some of the appalling waste," he said and then rattled off a list of examples, including: "$10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;He's referring to one country but USAID — the United States Agency for International Development — has funded male circumcision programs in a number of countries in southern and eastern Africa through the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health experts and HIV prevention advocates agree that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-hiv-hepatitis-and-stis-programmes/hiv/prevention/voluntary-medical-male-circumcision" target="_blank"&gt;voluntary medical male circumcisions&lt;/a&gt; — a procedure where a medical provider removes the foreskin of a penis from a volunteer patient — are a highly effective prevention for HIV. The procedure has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission from women to men and is a cost-effective HIV prevention intervention in countries with high infection rates.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The procedure is recommended for males after the onset of puberty, when they are more likely to be sexually active, and differs from ceremonial circumcisions which are typically done by a non-medical provider in a non-medical setting. "The benefits of the procedure are for both [the patient] and their future partners, and ultimately, in a big way, for the community and country to reduce the spread of HIV," says &lt;a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/anna-bershteyn" target="_blank"&gt;Anna Bershteyn&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of population health at the Grossman School of Medicine at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A local anesthetic is used in the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A 60% prevention benefit&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Voluntary medical male circumcision became a gold standard for HIV prevention in the early 2000s, after three groundbreaking research studies from the National Institutes of Health and the French National Agency for Research on AIDS revealed that African countries with higher rates of male circumcision had &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241595988" target="_blank"&gt;lower rates of HIV infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If a man is circumcised, it will reduce his chance of acquiring HIV by 60%," says &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Mahy&lt;/a&gt;, the director for Data for Impact at the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists still don't know for sure how removal of foreskin reduces risk of HIV infection, but research suggests that male foreskin has a larger number of a certain type of cells that HIV grabs onto. Bershteyn says there's evidence that when the foreskin is removed during circumcision, the skin on the penis changes and the number of HIV-vulnerable cells on the skin's surface is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"But aside from understanding the how, we have incredibly strong evidence from multiple randomized trials that, whatever the mechanisms, this procedure greatly reduces the risk of HIV infection," says Bershteyn.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2007, on the heels of these research findings, the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS began recommending voluntary medical male circumcisions in countries with high HIV prevalence and low rates of circumcision. Shortly after, PEPFAR, which is mainly overseen by USAID, stepped up its efforts to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3663585/" target="_blank"&gt;support male circumcision programs&lt;/a&gt; around the world, including in Mozambique.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Over the last 18 years, governments around eastern and southern Africa, where there are high risks amongst men having vaginal sex, began to work with PEPFAR, the Global Fund and community groups and advocates to begin to scale up access to circumcision," says &lt;a href="https://avac.org/mitchell-warren/" target="_blank"&gt;Mitchell Warren&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of AVAC, an HIV prevention non-profit organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Warren notes that PEPFAR and other groups didn't focus on circumcising men everywhere but instead used data-driven approaches to target specific regions that have high rates of HIV and low rates of circumcisions — including Mozambique. Since 2007, PEPFAR has supported &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/results-and-impact-pepfar" target="_blank"&gt;32.5 million voluntary medical male circumcisions&lt;/a&gt; in men and boys.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In Mozambique, the Mozambican Ministry of Health developed a national male circumcision strategy in 2009, with the support of PEPFAR. According to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.11.20.24317610v1" target="_blank"&gt;research from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, between 2010-2023, more than 2.5 million voluntary medical male circumcisions were performed in the country, with 41% in boys younger than 15. And among those who received circumcisions, less than 2% became infected with HIV. This research has yet to be peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And unlike other prevention tools like oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and condoms, because the procedure only has to be done once, male circumcisions are &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2023-voluntary-medical-male-circumcision-shown-to-be-highly-cost-effective--highlighting-the-need-to-intensify-scale-up-and-sustainability" target="_blank"&gt;cost effective as HIV prevention&lt;/a&gt;. "The investment made in voluntary male medical circumcision actually pays for itself relatively quickly," says Bershteyn, and can "lighten the burden on governments and on donor agencies that are trying to prevent HIV deaths," since protected individuals don't require costly and lifelong treatments.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Warren says male circumcisions are "one of the best [HIV] prevention investments we have."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to the State Department for comment on Trump's remarks but did not receive a response in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bec Roldan is an independent science journalist based in Brooklyn, N.Y.

&lt;p&gt;Further, detailed examination of the participants' immune responses showed not only systemic response, but responses in distant mucus membranes. In the blood, two types of antibodies (IgA and IgG) increased by several fold after vaccination compared with the placebo group. The group with the largest responses was the one that received the high dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test that acts as a surrogate for neutralizing antibody responses to norovirus indicated that the antibodies spurred by the vaccine could block the virus. Additional tests found that cellular immune responses were also activated and that the systemic responses result in protection in places far from the intestines—namely the mouth and nose. Saliva tests and nasal swabs found significant jumps in secreted IgA against norovirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune responses were strongest in the first two months after vaccination and diminished over time, but some persisted for nearly seven months. When the scientists looked at differences between the two age groups (55–65 and 65–80), they didn't see significant differences, suggesting the vaccine was equally effective in the older group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the scientists at Vaxart concluded that the vaccine "has the potential to inhibit infection, viral shedding, and transmission."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, VXA-G1.1-NN administration in older adults led to robust and durable immunogenicity detected both in circulation and multiple mucosal sites, an exciting outcome considering that diminished cellular and mucosal immunity are typical in older populations," they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not so good news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook isn't entirely rosy, though—there is some bad news. While immune responses rose in statistically significant measures during this small early-stage trial, it's unclear if that equates to real-life protection. And there's some good reason to be wary. In 2023, Vaxart &lt;a href="https://vaxart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Vaxart-Monovalent-Norovirus-Challenge-Study-Data-Review.pdf"&gt;released results of a challenge study&lt;/a&gt;, in which 141 brave souls (76 vaccinated and 65 given a placebo) were deliberately exposed to norovirus to see if the vaccine was protective. The results were weak: 53 placebo-group members (81.5 percent) became infected with norovirus, as determined by a PCR test looking for genetic evidence of the virus in their stool—and so did 76 vaccinated people (60 percent). That worked out to the vaccine offering only &lt;a href="https://investors.vaxart.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vaxart-announces-topline-data-phase-2-challenge-study-its"&gt;a 29 percent lower relative risk of getting infected&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at whether infected people developed symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, the vaccine had a protective efficacy of about 21 percent: 34 vaccinated people (48 percent) versus 37 placebo-group members (57 percent) developed symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified a critical “midlife window” for preventing age-related brain decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2416433122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has unveiled that brain aging follows a distinct yet nonlinear trajectory with critical transition points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This represents a paradigm shift in how we think about brain aging prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted by an international team of scientists led by Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi of Stony Brook University, offers new insights into when interventions to prevent cognitive decline might be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed functional communication between brain regions (brain networks) in more than 19,300 individuals across four large-scale datasets. Their findings reveal that the brain networks degrade in a manner that follows an S-shaped statistical curve with clear transition points, rather than either the late-life clinical onset or gradual linear decline previously assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect is first seen around age 44, with the degeneration hitting peak acceleration around age 67 and plateauing by age 90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous work by the team, led by collaborator Nathan Smith, had shown that the brain’s signaling is impacted by neurons’ loss of energy (hypometabolism). Thus, population-level transition points suggest there are specific windows when intervention could be most impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Understanding exactly when and how brain aging accelerates gives us strategic timepoints for intervention,” says lead author Mujica-Parodi, director of the Laboratory for Computational Neurodiagnostics (LCNeuro), chair for metabolic neuroscience, and professor of biomedical engineering in the Laufer Center for Physical and Quantitative Biology and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve identified a critical midlife window where the brain begins to experience declining access to energy but before irreversible damage occurs, essentially the ‘bend’ before the ‘break.’ During midlife, neurons are metabolically stressed due to insufficient fuel; they’re struggling, but they’re still viable,” Mujica-Parodi explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, providing an alternative fuel during this critical window can help restore function. However, by later ages, neurons’ prolonged starvation may have triggered a cascade of other physiological effects that make intervention less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers not only mapped this aging trajectory but identified its primary driver: neuronal insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory biomarkers, they found that metabolic changes consistently preceded vascular and inflammatory ones. Gene expression analyses further implicated the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4 and the lipid transport protein APOE (a known &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/exhausted-immune-cells-alzheimers-disease-3165972/"&gt;Alzheimer’s risk factor&lt;/a&gt;) in these aging patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, these same gene expression analyses also identified the neuronal ketone transporter MCT2 as a potential protective factor, suggesting that enhancing the brain’s ability to utilize ketones—an alternative brain fuel that neurons can metabolize without insulin—might be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding of the ketone transporter then motivated an interventional study, in which researchers compared administration of individually weight-dosed and calorically matched glucose and ketones to 101 participants at different stages along the aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects were striking in this cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike glucose, ketones effectively stabilized deteriorating brain networks, but with effects that differed significantly across critical transition points. Ketones showed moderate benefits in young adults (20-39 years), showed maximum benefits during the midlife “metabolic stress” period (40-59 years) after which networks begin destabilizing, but had diminished impact in older adults (60-79 years) once the network destabilization hit maximum acceleration and the domination of compounding vascular effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mujica-Parodi and coauthors say that these findings could revolutionize approaches to &lt;a href="https://www.futurity.org/games-puzzles-slow-cognitive-decline-3253082/"&gt;preventing&lt;/a&gt; age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current treatments typically target symptoms after they appear, often too late for meaningful intervention. This research suggests that metabolic intervention—whether through dietary approaches like ketogenic diets or supplements—might be most effective when started in one’s 40s, well before cognitive symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This represents a paradigm shift in how we think about brain aging prevention,” notes Botond Antal, postdoctoral associate in biomedical engineering at Stony Brook and first author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than waiting for cognitive symptoms, which may not appear until substantial damage has occurred, we can potentially identify people at risk through neurometabolic markers and intervene during this critical window.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a public health standpoint, these findings could inform new screening guidelines and preventive approaches, emphasizes Mujica-Parodi. Early (mid-life) identification of increasing insulin resistance in the brain (not just the blood), coupled with targeted metabolic interventions, might substantially delay cognitive aging for millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the global population aging rapidly and dementia cases projected to triple by 2050, these insights into the timing and mechanisms of brain aging offer new hope for preventive strategies that could maintain cognitive health well into later life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional researchers from Stony Brook University, Massachusetts General Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Oxford University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the research came from the WM Keck Foundation and the National Science Foundation (NSF) Brain Research through Advancing Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

so that it can spread among humans, which it currently can't do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most human cases have been mild - only suffering from &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/28988178/swollen-eye-dismissed-conjunctivitis-cancer-acute-myeloid-leukaemia/" rel=""&gt;conjunctivitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wellness/29894203/everyday-mistakes-tired-all-the-time-fatigue/"&gt;tiredness&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32198586/sore-throat-remedies-tested/"&gt;sore throat&lt;/a&gt; - the virus could cause severe illness if it continues to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last month, the US reported its &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32644468/man-dies-bird-flu-pandemic/" rel=""&gt;first human death from H5N1&lt;/a&gt; this year, a Louisiana man in his mid-60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic analysis at the time suggested the virus had evolved inside the man, potentially making it more severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adw3278" rel="nofollow"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, US experts are calling for immediate action to prevent an outbreak from taking place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“H5N1’s potential to spread [means] urgent action is needed to address pandemic preparedness gaps,” lead author Dr Jesse Goodman, from Georgetown University Medical Center, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Enhancing readiness now can save lives and reduce societal and economic disruption if H5N1 or another outbreak becomes&lt;br&gt;a pandemic," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes amid growing concerns among Czech scientists that the already highly pathogenic virus could be &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/33615291/bird-flu-cats-h5n1-spreads-by-wind/" rel=""&gt;spreading in the wind&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, it was believed that close, prolonged contact with an infected bird or their droppings was the only way to contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/medicines-vitamins-vaccines/"&gt;Vaccine&lt;/a&gt; development for H5N1 has been slow, relying mostly on protein-based jabs that take months to produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="bc-video-6321140169112" class="brightcove"&gt;&lt;p class="brightcove__holder lazyload"&gt;&lt;video data-account="5067014667001" data-player="uiG1O6QRm" data-video-id-pending="6321140169112" data-brightcove-id="video_6321140169112_5067014667001-80975" id="video_6321140169112_5067014667001-80975" data-application-id="Inline" controls="" class="brightcove__video" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="recommended-videos-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="article__bc_video-caption"&gt;‘Worst-case bird flu scenarios’ being probed by top Covid scientists after girl, 11, dies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggested an &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/27655565/mrna-cancer-vaccine-first-clinical-trial-glioblastoma/"&gt;mRNA vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, like those used for &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt;, could speed up the process - but only if governments and regulators work faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also stress that global cooperation is crucial to ensure vaccines and treatments reach everyone, not just wealthy nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To ensure equitable access, a global access framework should be established, including an entity that can provide financing and advanced vaccine purchases for low- and middle-income countries,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also calls for &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/pandemic/" rel=""&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt; response plans to undergo “transparent in-depth testing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is so countries can “share plans and playbooks and form global collaborations that incorporate different disease scenarios and immunisation strategies," they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the &lt;span&gt;World Health Organisation (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/world-health-organization/" rel=""&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; added &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/bird-flu/"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt; to its list of '37 &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/25382200/killer-virus-pandemic-threat-ear-bleeding/" rel=""&gt;priority pathogens'&lt;/a&gt; that have pandemic potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British government recently announced that it had &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32075603/uk-stockpile-bird-flu-vaccines-pathogenic-pandemic-h5n1/" rel=""&gt;procured five million doses of an H5 protein-based vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, in case the virus starts to spread between humans, something that could trigger a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__media"&gt;&lt;div class="article__media-img-container open-gallery" data-index="2"&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;img alt="a diagram showing how bird flu could spread" class="alignnone wp-image-21504185" data-credit="" data-img="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=574" data-caption="" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 335px, (max-width: 520px) 480px, 620px" srcset="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=335 335w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=480 480w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=620 620w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=670 670w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=960 960w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=1240 1240w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=1005 1005w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=1440 1440w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=1860 1860w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=1340 1340w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=1920 1920w, https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?w=2480 2480w" loading="lazy" src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/vp-graphic-bird-flu_720.jpg?strip=all&amp;amp;w=574" role="img"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="article__gallery-count"&gt;&lt;span class="article__gallery-count-value"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;FUELD BY WIND?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a new, &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.12.637829v1"&gt;non-peer-reviewed study&lt;/a&gt; published in bioRxiv by experts from the State Veterinary Institute in Prague suggested the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/32498442/bird-flu-adapt-spread-infect-h5n1-mutate/"&gt;avian flu&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Vaxart Inc. and the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of an oral norovirus vaccine tablet, VXA-G1.1-NN. Results indicate that the vaccine was safe and well tolerated while eliciting robust systemic and mucosal immune responses in adults aged 55 to 80 years.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Norovirus infections cause approximately 20 million cases of acute gastroenteritis annually in the United States, leading to 70,000 hospitalizations and up to 800 deaths. The economic impact is estimated at $10.6 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older adults, particularly those in long-term care facilities, are disproportionately affected, with 90% of norovirus-associated deaths occurring in individuals aged 65 and older. No licensed vaccine currently exists to prevent norovirus infections, despite the significant health care burden it imposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "An Oral Norovirus Vaccine Tablet Was Safe and Elicited Mucosal Immunity in Older Adults in a Phase 1b Clinical Trial," &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ads0556" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of VXA-G1.1-NN in healthy &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 65 participants aged 55 to 80 years were enrolled at three clinical sites in the United States. Participants were randomized to receive either the oral VXA-G1.1-NN vaccine or a placebo at a 2:1 ratio. The vaccine was administered at three dose levels (low, medium, and high) using a prime-boost strategy, with doses given 28 days apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary outcomes included safety and tolerability, measured by adverse events. Secondary outcomes assessed immunogenicity, including serum antibody responses, functional antibody activity, mucosal immunity, and cellular immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Vaccination with VXA-G1.1-NN was well tolerated across all dose levels. No serious adverse events or vaccine-related Grade 3 reactions were reported. Mild to moderate symptoms, including headache and malaise, were the most common side effects. Solicited adverse events were reported at lower rates in the high-dose group compared to lower doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination induced dose-dependent increases in VP1-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. Serum IgA and IgG responses remained elevated above baseline for 210 days. Functional antibodies, measured through a Norovirus Blocking Antibody Assay (NBAA), showed significant increases in the high-dose group, indicating neutralizing potential against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust mucosal immune responses were observed. Salivary and nasal IgA concentrations increased significantly by day 28 and remained elevated through day 210. Antibody-secreting cells expressing the gut-homing marker α4β7 were detected one week post-vaccination, supporting the vaccine's ability to induce a strong mucosal response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar immune responses were observed between the current older adult participants (55 to 80 years) and younger adults (aged 18 to 49 years) from a prior clinical trial. A cross-study analysis showed comparable serum antibody titers, mucosal IgA levels, and antigen-specific B cell responses between the two age groups, suggesting that the vaccine's effectiveness was not significantly impacted by immunosenescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral administration of VXA-G1.1-NN was found to be safe, well tolerated, and capable of generating durable immune responses in older adults. The study supports the feasibility of an oral vaccine for norovirus, which could offer advantages over injectable vaccines, including ease of distribution and self-administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a phase 1 safety trial, further trials are required to evaluate effectiveness of the vaccine. A phase 2 clinical trial is currently investigating a bivalent version targeting both GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus genogroups to explore potential cross-protection against diverse norovirus strains.&lt;/p&gt;

The rise of mail-order pharmacies has also contributed to the decline of retail stores. While these factors are part of the story, as a prescribing physician for more than 30 years, I’ve also seen a deterioration in the ability of pharmacists to think and communicate — keys to helping any business thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ef38" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;More than ever, pharmacists create or escalate problems, rather than helping solve them. I’ve seen it. My patients see it. This behavior of pharmacists is a neglected factor contributing to failing pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/health-wellness/how-stimulant-epidemic-messes-with-all-of-us"&gt;I'm A Neuroscientist: This Is How The Stimulant Epidemic Messes With All Of Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="d8c0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Perplexingly, this decline in pharmacist performance has occurred simultaneously with an increase in the rigor of pharmacist training. Pharmacists spend&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6418852/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; more years&lt;/a&gt; in the educational system, with greater emphasis on patient interactions, than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5f7d" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Most pharmacists are hardworking, caring individuals who conduct their jobs adequately much of the time. Rising rates of poorer performance by pharmacists derive from broader social trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5f7d" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;We’re all flooded with too much information and pressure to respond quickly. Our lives are more hectic. Looking at what is occurring in pharmacies gives us a glimpse at how we are changing our whole world, and not necessarily for the better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Years of scrolling on our phones have shortened our attention spans, made us less patient, and increased our propensity to respond quickly but without adequate consideration of context, nuance, and consequences.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-01/pharmacies-world-fraying.png" alt="Pharmacies Are Failing And Our World Is Fraying" title="Pharmacies Are Failing And Our World Is Fraying" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Yuri A / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My practice isn’t perfect, either&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="4c38" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I’m aware that I may sound like the codger lamenting how things were in the old days. Much of my evidence about pharmacist behavior is anecdotal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4c38" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I haven’t increased the number of patients I treat or prescriptions I write, but the amount of time I waste each month sorting out problems with pharmacies has increased substantially in the last decade. More problems arise, and they take longer to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b5bc" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;The challenges are not all the fault of pharmacists. I occasionally make errors in entering prescriptions into my electronic system. Perhaps I’ve become less intelligent, less articulate, or less patient over the years. But feedback from other realms of my life doesn’t support those conjectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="809c" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I am friends and neighbors with several smart, conscientious, and empathetic pharmacists. I’m not claiming that all pharmacists are failing all of the time. But in an era where the field proclaims that we are moving towards “precision” medicine and “individualized” medicine, pharmacists are failing too often with mainstream, everyday dispensing requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b481" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I understand that pharmacists are overworked. I get it that in addition to corporate pressures, they face increasingly intrusive government regulations. These are major contributors to any pharmacist’s workplace stress. I don’t want to blame the victims. However, an increasing tendency for pharmacists to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/2022353276/why-you-need-think-about-your-words-you-say-them"&gt;respond before thinking&lt;/a&gt; has compounded the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;An anecdote, not an antidote&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="1b34" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;My patient Sara’s ADHD was well controlled with three 18 mg pills of an extended-release form of Ritalin each morning. She takes two upon waking and the third pill about three hours later, before noon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b34" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;If she takes all 54 mg first thing in the morning she feels unmedicated and less functional by the end of her day. The three 18 mg pill regimen has been much easier for her to manage than two separate prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1b34" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;When she tried to juggle taking a 36 mg pill first, and an 18 mg pill later, she had too many days with either unfilled prescriptions or misplaced pill bottles. Simple things like that trip up many individuals with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5167" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Her life was on track…. until her most recent attempt at filling her prescription. I entered the instructions into the electronic prescribing software. For clarity, and to prevent the insurance company from forcing Sara to take a single 54 mg pill, I amended these directions so they read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b3fb" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;“Take 3 pills every morning. Two pills early a.m., and one pill late a.m..” In addition, the system required that I check boxes that denote that for a 30-day supply, Sarah will receive 90 pills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7211" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;After months of this prescription working smoothly, the pharmacy abruptly objected. Their fax demanded: “Six pills a day?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6ad3" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I faxed back that nothing in those two separate sentences, or the box marked “three pills a day,” indicated six pills a day. I received faxes back about “inconsistent instructions.” The pharmacy sent me more than six faxes before they were willing to fill the prescription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="bf24" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;This was not a case of deciphering illegible handwriting. Or translating obscure Latin abbreviations. When I shared the story, some people suspected that the pharmacy response was so inane that it must have been written by AI, not a real human. Perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9504" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;But the system is broken if it took six back-and-forths before fixing a non-existent problem. Maybe it was generated by a bot, but the pharmacy’s reaction aligned so closely with many other incidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9504" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;These are cases in which a pharmacist responded quickly, and without thinking, to a prescription that seemed slightly out of the ordinary, and then had trouble comprehending and reframing their initial impulsive reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9504" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt; Numerous times pharmacists have claimed that there were “discrepancies” between what my electronic prescribing system printed in different sections of a prescription when all of the entries conveyed the same information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/woman-charged-extra-after-crying-during-doctors-visit"&gt;Woman Says She Was Charged Extra For 'Emotional Intervention' After Crying During A Recent Doctor's Visit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Electronic prescribing to the rescue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="b2d0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Most states now mandate that prescriptions be sent in electronically, rather than as hand-written hard copies.&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20786190.2016.1254932" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; Illegible handwriting&lt;/a&gt; no longer leads to filling a prescription with the wrong medication, or wrong dose. Upwards of 10% of hand-written prescriptions were not decipherable, and pharmacists tended to make more mistakes than doctors or nurses in reading them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ab4e" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Ironically, I had at least two instances, years ago, of pharmacists calling to verify whether I had prescribed because my handwriting was so neat and legible. In this era of electronic prescriptions, I don’t have to worry about such calls anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ec32" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Electronic prescribing was&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2995649/#:~:text=This%20study%20reviewed%202914%20electronic,a%20hospital%20admission%20or%20death." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; supposed to eliminate problems&lt;/a&gt; with poor handwriting and decrease errors in filling prescriptions. However, some studies found that the type of&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667276623001464" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; errors only shifted&lt;/a&gt;, rather than decreased, with the switch to electronic prescriptions. It was too easy for prescribers to click the wrong button, or select the wrong item when clicking on a list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="16f8" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Many electronic prescribing systems are poorly designed, with cluttered and conflicting screens, and redundancies that don’t ensure quality control. Potential error warnings are delivered so frequently, and for such trivial and nonsensical reasons, that they are customarily ignored by many prescribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5797" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I’ve read automated warnings that were incorrect about:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="bdaa" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;drug-drug interactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="2281" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;the mechanism of action&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="74fd" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;the&lt;a href="https://medium.com/wise-well/professionals-shouldnt-provide-medication-misinformation-373e64b5e5ef" rel="noopener nofollow"&gt; duration of action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="4cab" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;how long a patient should take a medication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="5a63" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;effective doses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="b0cc" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;One recent, unnecessary alert informed me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4a78" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;“This is above the accepted daily dose range for this drug (400.0 mg/day) but near or below the accepted maximum daily dose of 450.0 mg/day. Please evaluate this dose for appropriateness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fb23" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Pharmacists who are exposed to such nonsense all day long incorporate misinformation into their understanding of medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3b1a" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;And why are we still using faxes in the medical world? Having loose paper fluttering about the office is both an environmental waste and an opportunity for privacy violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3b1a" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Many fax systems convert the faxes to emails anyway, so what is being saved or protected? Medicine needs to move beyond the&lt;a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/oxcdQeqgBPG8kbq38" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dragnet&lt;/em&gt; days&lt;/a&gt; of Sgt. Joe Friday asking for “Just the fax, ma’am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One more computer problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="af96" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;For almost a decade, Walgreens pill bottle labels incorrectly stated “no refills” about 20% of the time when there were actual refills on the original prescription. But their computers contained accurate records of those potential refills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="af96" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;The erroneous information on the labels &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-you-dont-realize-do-because-high-functioning-anxiety"&gt;created untold anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and inefficiency, as worried patients contacted their pharmacy to find out whether they had refills or not, doctors had to field calls to rewrite prescriptions that were still in the system, and pharmacists had to deal with aggravated patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ba3d" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;This problem was pervasive enough that it was not a simple data entry problem, it was a software problem. I understand that a coding bug that causes an intermittent problem is harder to detect and correct than an error that completely shuts down the system. But this error cost pharmacies time and goodwill and should have been solved much more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5cb1" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;This failure to fix a problem reinforces the public’s perception that the corporate forces running modern medicine simply don’t care about people. They don’t care about the people they are serving or those they employ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e321" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Another example of this is that many big chain pharmacies appear as if they are intergalactic pharmacist training centers. As soon as a pharmacist grows comfortable with their computer system and familiar with the customers, they get transferred away to another location. The pharmacists are treated as indistinguishable cogs in a machine, rather than as a part of a human community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4728" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;More than half of pharmacists currently endorse that they are&lt;a href="https://www.industrypharmacist.org/resources/2d739c86cc7a4e0cabcaca7825773d9f.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; experiencing burnout&lt;/a&gt;.

There were more than&lt;a href="https://www.aacp.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/pharmacy-demand-report-10172023.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; 60,000 job postings&lt;/a&gt; for pharmacists in 2023, and many remained unfilled, despite signing bonuses of tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c717" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.appliedpolicy.com/the-u-s-pharmacist-shortage/#:~:text=Of%20the%20approximately%20323%2C500%20pharmacists,3%20billion%20prescription%20each%20year." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Understaffed pharmacies&lt;/a&gt; leave more work for those who remain on the job, and longer waits for customers. The prevalence of frustration with corporate control over our current medical system was recently demonstrated by the&lt;a href="https://people.com/luigi-mangione-sympathy-hampering-investigation-law-enforcement-expert-exclusive-8759018" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; outpouring of sympathy&lt;/a&gt; extended towards the assassin of the CEO of a major managed care conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Government makes it worse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="5107" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;In addition to corporate pressure, pharmacists face increasing government regulation. The thousands of needless deaths from the opioid crisis provoked federal agencies to more tightly regulate the dispensing of controlled substances. As a result, prescriptions for&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/understanding-the-opioid-overdose-epidemic.html#:~:text=From%202021%2D2022%3A1&amp;amp;text=The%20rate%20of%20overdose%20deaths%20involving%20heroin%20decreased%2036%25.,prescription%20opioids%20decreased%20approximately%2012%25." rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; opioid pain medications&lt;/a&gt; have decreased as have deaths from opioid overdoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c0c9" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;However, some individuals who were using prescription opioids responsibly have been cut off from the medications that enabled them to function and reduce intense suffering. Other downsides of the new regulations are that pharmacies and doctors have been burdened with new paperwork and threats of legal liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="c524" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Magnifying the problem, some pharmacies have employed draconian measures extending far beyond the federal regulations. They seem more concerned about the potential for reprimands than about providing a service to their patients. They’re practicing cover-themselves pharmacy rather than patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/victim-medical-gaslighting"&gt;I Was A Victim Of Medical Gaslighting — 'You Don't Look Sick'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A patient stuck in the morass&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="0942" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;For seven years before I first started working with Ferris, and for the 11 years he has been my patient, he has been using the same medications to deal with symptoms from his lupus, degenerated spinal column, ADHD, and occasional panic attacks. He never refilled his controlled substance prescriptions early, had shown no signs of medication misuse, and had no problematic or dangerous side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b47a" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Recently, a panic attack sent Ferris to the ER. Hours later, the pharmacist refused to refill his prescription for the anti-anxiety medication he takes for emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="cbe7" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I called and spoke with the pharmacist, and then the chief pharmacist managing the store. I reviewed with her Ferris’ diagnoses, symptomatic responses, stability of his dosing regimen, and his awareness of the potential for side effects and drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="89d5" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;She said that she wasn’t comfortable filling his prescriptions. She said it was because of the DEA scrutiny regarding individuals taking multiple controlled medications. I reminded her that I had just explained the medical justification for each agent and that her notes about our conversation would satisfy all DEA requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="131b" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;She insisted that the DEA required that she have all of Ferris’ office notes and that she wouldn’t fill the prescription without them. She didn’t question, or cite as problematic, any aspect of his care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="131b" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;She claimed that even a signed and written note from me summarizing what we had just discussed would not suffice. No chart, no prescription refill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="88c0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;After more than two decades of using this pharmacy, Ferris, with back pain and limited mobility, trudged three-quarters of a mile down the street to a Walgreens pharmacy. He had never filled prescriptions there, and the pharmacist was completely unfamiliar with him. Yet after a simple check of the state database of his history of filling controlled substance prescriptions, the pharmacist filled all of Ferris’ prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1f7a" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;No DEA rule precluded him from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8c91" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;I don’t know what motivated the first pharmacist’s reluctance. I’m pretty sure she wasn’t a bot. However, she was unwilling to engage with the facts of the situation, either regarding the patient’s health or what government regulations stipulated. It appeared that she made an impulsive decision and was unable to stop and think about her position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Our brains on computers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="f3bb" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;In 2011, author&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6418852/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; Nicholas Carr’s book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains&lt;/em&gt; summarized the neuroscience showing that internet immersion results in shorter attention spans. But more importantly, he explored how computers rewire our brains so that we respond more quickly, crave emotionally laden information, and reduce our ability to think deeply about topics. Our ability to understand context and nuance diminishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="acac" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;As we think less deeply, we also diminish &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-easy-youre-empathetic-very-challenging-normal-people"&gt;our ability to empathize&lt;/a&gt;. Multiple factors are at play in shaping all of our behaviors. The busy workdays and excessive paperwork facing pharmacists interfere with their very ability to do their jobs. But I think I am detecting larger, more pervasive trends in local drugstores that reflect greater social patterns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7bf0" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;The influence of the internet may provide us with more facts, more entertainment, and more stuff, but it is also contributing to us being less patient, more superficial, less informed, and less considerate. It makes us more easily manipulated by corporations, the media, and political parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="607f" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;How do we remedy this? Pharmacists should strive to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="3aa5" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Remove inaccurate and redundant warnings from their systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id="1fe5" data-selectable-paragraph=""&gt;Pay attention to patient responses.

                          &lt;ul class="summary-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;2024 Mr. Olympia winner Samson Dauda said he once struggled to gain weight and build muscle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more home-cooked meals and whole foods helped him gain size and strength to compete.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;His workouts aim to maximize muscle with a mix of high reps and heavy weight in time-saving supersets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at Samson Dauda, you'd never guess he used to be a skinny kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the winner of the 2024 Mr. Olympia — the most prestigious award in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-muscle-according-to-pro-bodybuilder-sadik-hadzovic-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;bodybuilding&lt;/a&gt; — said he once had a hard time gaining muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I was young, I struggled to put on weight. I was one of those guys that could get away with eating everything and I didn't put on a pound," he told Business Insider in an interview on his partnership with energy drink brand Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Dauda weighs in at as much as 330 pounds in the off season as he packs on muscle for competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Nigeria, Dauda moved to the UK as a teenager, and started his athletic career in rugby, where a teammate introduced him to bodybuilding. He started competing in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, at age 34, he quit his job as a construction worker to focus on bodybuilding full time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said two changes to his diet and workout routine have helped him break through muscle-building plateaus: eating heaps of nutritious food, and hitting high-rep, time-saving workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="41d7d99f-9ca9-415a-8008-74cc7d8a72c2" data-toc-id="41d7d99f-9ca9-415a-8008-74cc7d8a72c2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-rep supersets can boost muscle growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="41d7d99f-9ca9-415a-8008-74cc7d8a72c2"&gt;Dauda said that, as someone who struggled to make gains, his workouts involve as much time under tension as possible to prompt &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-rock-strength-coach-shares-3-techniques-build-more-muscle-2022-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;muscle growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="41d7d99f-9ca9-415a-8008-74cc7d8a72c2"&gt;To do that, his typical routine involves back-to-back sets of exercise that start with a high number of reps at &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bodybuilder-technique-build-muscle-with-lighter-weight-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;light weight&lt;/a&gt;, and then decrease the reps while increasing the weight over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="41d7d99f-9ca9-415a-8008-74cc7d8a72c2"&gt;The strategy allows him to get the benefits of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/41-year-old-built-muscle-burned-fat-workout-changes-2024-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;lifting heavier weights&lt;/a&gt;, while also maximizing the time his muscles are working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="41d7d99f-9ca9-415a-8008-74cc7d8a72c2"&gt;"You're putting a lot of strain in the muscle over a long period," Dauda said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="41d7d99f-9ca9-415a-8008-74cc7d8a72c2"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-muscle-and-burn-fat-faster-with-supersets-2024-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Supersets&lt;/a&gt; — performing two exercises one after another without rest — can also be useful for muscle building because it saves time. Switching up the exercise allows you to let one muscle group rest while the other is working, so you don't have to wait between sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="293afdc4-8690-4f55-b218-0cb0522dea17" data-toc-id="293afdc4-8690-4f55-b218-0cb0522dea17"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need extra calories and nutrients to build muscle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that work in the gym needs fuel, and Dauda said eating nutrient-dense whole foods instead of processed food improved his gains.&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                      &lt;p&gt;"You have to give your body the building blocks for you to be able to use to build muscle," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a pro bodybuilder, eating becomes a full-time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dauda said his &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bulking-gain-muscle-faster-winter-season-expert-2021-12" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;off-season diet&lt;/a&gt;, when he's trying to build muscle, involves 7,500 calories a day, the vast majority of which is whole foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We cook all my meals at home, so we control everything. We know that the quality of food is there and are able to put on quality size with it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical meals include protein sources like eggs, chicken breast, steak, ground beef — research suggests the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-protein-maximize-muscle-gains-2022-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;ideal amount of protein for muscle gains&lt;/a&gt; is about 0.7 grams of protein per pound of your body weight daily. Dauda also eats plenty of carbs for energy from foods like oatmeal, sweet potatoes, and pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He supplements with whey protein shakes to make sure he's getting enough protein to build muscle. He also relies on caffeine, including Celsius, to keep his energy up in the weeks before a competition, when intense prep can be exhausting and makes it difficult to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dauda still gives himself a break, especially right after competition. His favorite post-show meal is pizza, ideally washed down with a big bottle of Coke. But after a few days of indulgence, Dauda is typically happy to go back to his routine of home-cooked healthy meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are so deprived for weeks and months on end that you have all these things you want to eat," he said.

&lt;p class=""&gt;Since the announcement by Oregon Department of Agriculture in late December 2024 that a raw pet food was the source of avian flu that caused a cat death (which turned out later the pet food was NOT the source of the cat’s infection), the number one question I’ve received from pet owners is: ‘should I stop feeding my cat raw food?’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;My response to these questions remains: I am still feeding my own pets (5 cats, 2 dogs) both raw food and cooked food, part commercial and part home prepared. I have not changed the way I feed my own pets, and I have not changed the style of food I give my own pets – nor do I have any plans to change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;For the most part, pet owners have ONLY been told about avian flu being detected in cats when it was linked to raw pet food or raw milk. But, when you look at what regulatory authorities have NOT told us…the data tells us a different story about avian flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS)&lt;/a&gt;, Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been detected in 105 domestic cats since May 2022 (in the US). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Below is a USA map indicating the detection of HPAI in mammals (from May 2022 through March 4, 2025).&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p class=""&gt;When you look closely at the above map, the various icons on the map indicate the species of animal detected to have been infected with HPAI. The small black box is the icon for domestic cat HPAI detections. Notice that these cat HPAI detections are not uniform across the US. In fact, in the area of the map color coded as light blue (the eastern section of the US) – there is only one case of domestic cat infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;To the contrary, pet foods are distributed nationwide. IF pet food was the source of HPAI infections in cats – we should see a map with a uniform distribution of cases across the US. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/hcp/animals/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;majority of these 105 domestic cat cases&lt;/a&gt; (and perhaps all of these cases) were linked to: “&lt;em&gt;Infection is thought to have happened via exposure to infected birds or other animals. In late March and early April 2024, Texas reported detection of HPAI A(H5N1) in several cats from several dairy farms experiencing HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections in dairy cows, suggesting the virus spread to the cats either from affected dairy cows, raw cow milk, or from wild birds associated with those farms&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Which aligns with more information from the Centers for Disease Control, confirming the risk of raw pet food is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/hpai-interim-recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published a guidance document&lt;/a&gt; outlining the agency’s recommendations “&lt;em&gt;for preventing human exposures to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses and infection prevention and control measures&lt;/em&gt;.” This guidance from CDC shares a risk category by exposure table, explaining the &lt;em&gt;“categories of individual risk for influenza A(H5N1) virus infection by setting and exposure.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;This CDC guidance states (note – this guidance is directed towards human exposure, not specifically pet exposure):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Considered: “&lt;em&gt;HIGH RISK OF EXPOSURE&lt;/em&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class=""&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Working on farms with poultry or cows with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection or sick poultry or cows exposed to those with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection; &lt;strong&gt;known close animal contact.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Examples provided for risk activities on farms include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class=""&gt;Milking cows&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class=""&gt;Getting splashed in face or eyes with raw milk from cows&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class=""&gt;Feeding or watering poultry or cows&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class=""&gt;Handling carcasses of dead cows, poultry culling, depopulation, butchering, evisceration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Considered: “&lt;em&gt;HIGH RISK OF EXPOSURE&lt;/em&gt;“.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class=""&gt;“Close or prolonged contact with wild birds with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection or their contaminated environments; &lt;strong&gt;known close bird contact.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Note: “close bird contact” was expressed as within 6 feet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Examples provided for risk activities of close bird contact include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class=""&gt;People in direct contact with sick or dead wild birds&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class=""&gt;People involved in depopulation/culling of wild birds&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class=""&gt;Wildlife agency employees in direct contact with sick or dead wild birds, including defeathering, carcass removal and disposal&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class=""&gt;Hunters who handle wild birds&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class=""&gt;Touching surfaces or materials (e.g., animal litter or bedding material) contaminated by wild birds with saliva, mucous, or feces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;With regards to raw milk…&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Considered: &lt;em&gt;“Currently, level of risk to humans is unknown but high level of concern based on available animal data.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Example provided for risk of raw milk: &lt;em&gt;“Drinking, consuming or exposure to contaminated raw cow’s milk from cows with confirmed or suspected HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection or other products made from contaminated raw cow’s milk.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;And significantly, the CDC’s perspective on consumption of raw meat/eggs… &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Considered: “&lt;em&gt;LOW RISK OF EXPOSURE”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class=""&gt;“Consuming &lt;strong&gt;potentially&lt;/strong&gt; raw or undercooked poultry products or eggs from poultry with confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Again, this CDC guidance is solely based on human risk – not pet risk – but, the information provided seems very clear; the greatest risk of HPAI virus infection &lt;strong&gt;is NOT consuming raw meat or eggs (raw pet food)&lt;/strong&gt;. The greatest risk of HPAI virus infection is with close animal contact to infected wild birds and infected poultry and cattle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;One more statistic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/news/pet-population-continues-increase-while-pet-spending-declines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AVMA&lt;/a&gt; states there were 73.8 million cats in US in 2024. The category of raw pet food is between 2-3% of the US pet food market. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;If 2% of US cats were eating a raw pet food, that would be 1,476,000 cats consuming a raw pet food daily. IF the cases of HPAI currently being investigated test to confirm the pet food was the source (estimating 5 potential cases), &lt;strong&gt;the risk of raw pet food exposing your cat to HPAI is an estimated 0.0003%. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;The greater risk (to me)…feed grade pet food.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://truthaboutpetfood.com/warning-letter-issued-to-mid-america-pet-food/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FDA Warning Letter issued to Mid America pet food&lt;/a&gt;, the agency stated “&lt;em&gt;FDA Investigators observed rainwater entering your facility through the roof while you were manufacturing multiple lots of dog food.&lt;/em&gt;“ &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Bird feces on the roof of this facility could contaminate the pet food with HPAI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;In an inspection report of a &lt;a href="https://truthaboutpetfood.com/millions-of-roaches-with-no-regulatory-enforcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mars Petcare facility&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA noted this pet food manufacturer: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to&lt;/strong&gt; inspect, segregate, or otherwise handle raw materials and ingredients used in manufacturing under conditions that will &lt;strong&gt;protect the animal food against contamination and minimize deterioration&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure to take effective measures to exclude pests from your plant&lt;/strong&gt; and protect against contamination of animal food by pests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;In 2008, in a &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080917203741/http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01854.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Petco distribution center&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“During an FDA inspection of a PETCO distribution center in April, widespread and active rodent and bird infestation was found. The FDA inspected the facility again in May and found continuing and widespread infestation.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Feed grade pet foods and feed grade manufacturing are NOT held to the same safety standards as human food. With known contamination risks being high with wild birds, manufacturing and warehousing standards must be free of bird infestations to protect the safety of the pet foods. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;With relation to pets, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/hcp/animals/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt; states: &lt;em&gt;“Sick animals may be able to transmit influenza virus to people in their saliva, feces or droppings, and other body fluids. Human infections can occur when the virus is inhaled or gets into a person’s eyes, nose, or mouth. This can happen when virus is in the air (in droplets or dust) and a person breathes it in, or when a person touches something that has virus on it and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class=""&gt;Every pet owner has to make up their own mind to what they feel is safe for their own pets. For me, I am putting my trust in pet foods manufactured and warehoused to human food safety standards. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Right? That is not necessarily true. Made of silicone, scar tape touts that it can be placed over a wound to minimize scarring and accelerate the healing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;I’m very familiar with scar tape and have used it multiple times. My two kids were both delivered via c-section and I used scar tape after each one. Doctors have told me that while some tend to scar quite a bit, my skin recovers nicely. Even still, I found that scar tape worked nicely to diminish the appearance of my c-section scar even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;We consulted with two board-certified dermatologists to get the scoop on what scar tape is and if it really works for most people. Below, find out what they had to say — plus, get a few recommendations for highly rated scar tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SKIP AHEAD&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="#anchor-abe1be"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is scar tape?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="#anchor-9c6106"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does scar tape really work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="#anchor-e374fc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use scar tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="#anchor-329537"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highly rated scar tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="#anchor-03fc5a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other ways to heal scars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/does-scar-tape-work-rcna195123#anchor-abe1be" id="anchor-abe1be" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What is scar tape?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Scar tape is a wound care product usually made from silicone that is used to help the healing of scars caused by surgery or injury,” explains &lt;a href="https://drannachacon.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Anna Chacon&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Florida. In terms of what it does, scar tape provides a protective barrier that can improve the healing environment and help to make scar tissue more flat, softer and less discolored, says Dr. Gary Goldenberg, a board-certified dermatologist and owner of &lt;a href="https://goldenbergdermatology.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Goldenberg Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scar tape can be purchased over the counter and comes in various shapes and sizes to fit all types of scars. This tape can also be cut down to size to fit over scars of various shapes and sizes perfectly. It has medical adhesive on one side, so it will gently stick to the skin without irritating it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/does-scar-tape-work-rcna195123#anchor-9c6106" id="anchor-9c6106" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Does scar tape really work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Several [research] publications have shown that silicone scar tape is effective — this is especially true of post-surgical scars,” says Goldenberg. But you should also manage your expectations. Chances are, scar tape will not make it look like you were never injured at all — but it can diminish the appearance of a scar. It’s also important to note that how well it works depends on various factors — including the severity of the wound and how your skin tends to heal. For example, some people tend to heal well, while others may keloid — their skin raises and gets firm as it heals. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/a-z/keloids-causes" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;, those with more melanin in their skin may be more prone to keloid. They also note that being on certain medications or having certain medical conditions may also make someone more prone to developing scars that keloid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It works similarly to a bandage, protecting your scar from bacteria and painful friction which can inhibit total healing,” says Chacon. “The added benefits of the silicone is better flexibility and added hydration that helps to nourish the skin and promote even, flat healing.” Research also backs this up. One study published in &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/wound.2015.0625" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advances in Wound Care&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that silicone scar tape can limit collagen production around a wound, which can help prevent raised or puckered skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/does-scar-tape-work-rcna195123#anchor-e374fc" id="anchor-e374fc" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to use scar tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Want to give scar tape a try? It’s most effective to use it as soon as a wound has closed and healed. You should never use scar tape on an open wound. In terms of what to look for when buying scar tape, Goldenberg suggests looking for options made from medical grade silicone and says that they can adhere to the scar for at least 12 hours. Some products may also be reusable, which can be helpful, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When you’re ready to apply the tape, make sure the wound area has been properly cleaned and is dry, says Chacon. “You should also cut the tape down to size so it fits your scar comfortably.” Then, when applying it, she says you should make sure you don’t stretch or spread the skin — doing so can put pressure on your scar and slow down or halt healing. “ Press the tape down onto the scar gently to ensure it adheres to your skin. At the end of each day, remove your scar tape gently so you can clean the wound and reapply your tape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Our experts stressed that one of the secrets to making sure scar tape works for you is committing to it. “To make it most effective, one has to use it consistently,” says Goldenberg. “It’s recommended to use it for 8 to 12 weeks — going past that may produce diminishing returns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/does-scar-tape-work-rcna195123#anchor-329537" id="anchor-329537" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Highly rated scar tape&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/does-scar-tape-work-rcna195123#anchor-03fc5a" id="anchor-03fc5a" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What are other ways to heal scars?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Scar tape isn’t your only option for trying to minimize scarring. “There are many alternative options — including silicone gel,” says Goldenberg, who says the topical gel is good for those with an adhesive allergy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Beyond silicone, there are several other treatments that dermatologists recommend. “I often suggest organic &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-vitamin-e-skin-care-products-rcna103948" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin E&lt;/a&gt; oil or petrolatum, which you can apply directly to a healed wound,” says Goldenberg. “There are also a number of in-office procedures that can flatten and improve scar appearance.” Goldenberg says he often recommends various laser treatments or microneedling to patients. If you’re interested in these, know they come at a much larger cost (sometimes in the thousands of dollars range). If you’re interested, it’s best to consult a dermatologist about your specific scar to see the most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Finally, both of our experts stressed the importance of using &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/how-shop-sunscreen-ncna1305708" target="_blank"&gt;sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; on your scars (after the wound has fully healed).

	&lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; is a vaccine conspiracy theorist with no real medical experience — which is why thousands of doctors and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/nobel-prize-winners-urge-senators-reject-rfk-jr-hhs-1235198466/"&gt;dozens of Nobel Prize winners&lt;/a&gt; opposed his confirmation to run the Department of Health and Human Services, and why countless others have been concerned about his ability to lead the nation through an infectious disease outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Well, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; has been spreading through West Texas since late January, and, sure enough, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/rfk-jr/" id="auto-tag_rfk-jr" data-tag="rfk-jr"&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt; hasn’t appeared up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy addressed the measles outbreak during President Donald Trump’s first Cabinet meeting late last month. He &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-1235281134/"&gt;largely brushed off&lt;/a&gt; the severity of the outbreak — claiming, falsely, that it’s “not unusual” — despite it resulting in the first measles death in the United States in a decade. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	A few days later, Kennedy was exploring nature in California. “Afternoon mountaineering above Coachella Valley,” he captioned &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/rfkjr/posts/afternoon-mountaineering-above-coachella-valley/1033006362196705/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; featuring a few shots of him smiling atop some rocks.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/05/rfk-measles-scrutiny-00214952" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday that the post caused alarm throughout HHS, where officials are working around the clock to contain the disease that has already infected &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;over 150 people&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a serious role, he’s just a couple of weeks in and measles is not a common occurrence, and it should be all hands on deck,” a former Trump official who has spoken to current health officials told the outlet. “When you’re taking a selfie out at Coachella, it’s pretty clear that you’re checked out.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The reason measles outbreaks are not common — despite what Kennedy said during the Cabinet meeting last week — is the efficacy of the vaccine. The disease has made something of a comeback in the past 20 years amid a rise in vaccine hesitancy, which Kennedy has long been fueling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It isn’t surprising that he’s pushing alternative medicine rather than vaccination as the outbreak spreads. Kennedy touted the MMR vaccine and said Americans need to make a “personal choice” about whether to get it in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; for Fox News on Sunday, but he also praised the effects of vitamin A, writing that it can “dramatically reduce measles mortality.” Experts have pushed back. “Vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination,” Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health, recently &lt;a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;, with Dr. Amesh Adalja of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security adding that Kennedy is taking information about vitamin A from scientific studies “out of context.”

	&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/as-measles-epidemic-spreads-warren-demands-rfk-jr-explain-irresponsible-and-reckless-efforts-to-undermine-vaccines-at-health-agency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wrote a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Kennedy the following day. “In your March 2nd op-ed responding to the Texas measles outbreak, which has already killed one unvaccinated child, you failed to include a strong call for vaccinations. Instead, you claimed that ‘good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious diseases.’ Do you believe good nutrition is a better defense against measles than the MMR vaccine? Will you change course and tell American parents to vaccinate their children to protect against measles, yes or no?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369595673112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;went on Fox News&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the outbreak on Tuesday. He did promote vaccination, but also touted how the HHS has “delivered vitamin A,” while also citing the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin, and cod liver oil as treatments. Dr. Ashish K. Jha, a former professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who served as President Joe Biden’s Covid-19 response coordinator, &lt;a href="https://x.com/ashishkjha/status/1897051550717026648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wrote on X&lt;/a&gt; that the appearance was “beyond absurd.”

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“No, steroids don’t treat measles,” he continued. “No Cod Liver Oil doesn’t treat measles. Vitamin A helps in poor countries where kids have vitamin deficiency. Managing measles is about prevention (vaccines), not quack treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Unfortunately for the people in West Texas contending with the disease — and for the rest of America — quack treatments are what’s in order as long as Kennedy is leading the nation’s health services.&lt;/p&gt;

The theory would be that depression affects men in different ways than females."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Depression is something that leads to more increased mortality due to health outcomes," the former CDC researcher added. "So perhaps sex is more effective because of the severity of how depression impacts females."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Banerjee noted there are 'multiple theories' as to why women between the ages of 20 and 59 who had sex less than once a week were at a 70 per cent increased risk of death within five years, saying: "For instance, sex releases endorphins that may prevent severe health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;There are 'multiple theories' behind the findings (LB Studios / Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Blood samples showed that particular women who had sex less than once a week had elevated levels of a key protein linked to inflammation, which can cause damage to healthy cells, tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Adversely, the participants who had sex more than once a week had lower levels of the protein and no increased death risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Interestingly, however, it was the complete opposite for the men, as those who had the most sex were almost most at risk of early death, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"With high sexual frequency," the researchers wrote, "males were six times more likely to experience increased mortality than females."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In women at least, the study states that sexual expression, which is quantitatively measured through sexual frequency, is an essential component of both physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Sexual activity is important for overall cardiovascular health possibly due to reduction of heart rate variability and blood flow increase," it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Now, while no one should ever feel any kind of pressure when it comes to having or not having intercourse, you can't deny, it's a pretty fascinating study!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Tyla</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:07:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPd1poRWpXUmQyVldDeEJmVUR6emt4OWhld3h1aWZNLVF5N2VMV0pCZ2M3ZXktbDVtYnl1TnBLaU44NnZJOVJwR0Fsdm9NbVd6S190WEhIenpKMGRVVkpuTW5TNDhaY0N6eVlLSDhybUtVUWNJU05EYk9rS3d3ZVIwMnhNVkcxUllSSjZ1STdhMFkzTm9kSTU3al9HdThqYXl6Vy0tdzlkUmt0YmM2</guid></item><item><title>Cancer breakthrough: Scientists discover how common drug stops cancer from spreading in 'Eureka moment' - GB News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE9jLWUycVVUMEtNY2tQWmxaaGh4Skt4SmJTZjNCQ0lPMW13QzZWeVVOSHduN1cxUUFmN0pyRmUtVUhvcklZb2Z1UDVRVWJMTkhUTzV2VURtcmw3dVR2eU0yN0xXcE4ya1lzNDJteXhDOWoxNDl5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Cambridge have described a "Eureka moment" in discovering how aspirin may prevent cancer from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking research, published in the prestigious journal Nature, revealed that aspirin strengthens the immune system's ability to identify and eliminate dangerous cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="rebellt-item

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by Dr. Rodrigo Quian Quiroga, group leader of the Neural Mechanisms of Perception and Memory Research Group at the Hospital del Mar Research Institute, has allowed scientists to observe for the first time how neurons in the human brain store memories independent of the context in which they are acquired.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211124724015699" target="_blank"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/i&gt;, the study confirms that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neurons/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; can distinguish objects or people regardless of their context, enabling the formation of higher and more abstract relationships, which constitute the basis of human intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to observe this neuronal behavior in humans. Until now, research conducted on animals had shown significant differences in the coding of concepts (such as a specific place, object, etc.) when the context changed. For example, neurons responded very differently if a rat found an object in one location versus another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, it was believed that such memories were stored in different groups of neurons. The study led by Dr. Quian Quiroga has yielded "surprising responses" that contradict previous findings, as neuronal responses to a specific concept remain the same when the context changes, such as remembering having seen a person in different locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The basic principle of neuronal coding in humans is the opposite of what has been observed in other species, which has significant implications," notes Dr. Quiroga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Single neuron data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved data from nine patients in Argentina and the United Kingdom with treatment for refractory epilepsy, who had electrodes implanted to monitor the activity of specific groups of neurons individually. This allowed researchers to obtain precise recordings of their responses, unlike previous human studies based on fMRI recording, which cannot differentiate individual neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Patients were presented with two stories featuring the same person in different contexts, supported by images. Thanks to the monitoring of individual neurons while performing this task, researchers could observe which groups of neurons were activated and how they responded in the two stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, they confirmed that if a neuron responded to a person's image, the response remained the same in both stories. Furthermore, when patients recounted the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/story/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; themselves, the same neurons were activated seconds before they referred to the protagonist, and also in the same way for both stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Memories are stored in a much more abstract manner in humans compared to other animals. You can think of concepts or anything else in more abstract terms, independent of the context in which you learned them," explains Dr. Quiroga, suggesting that this could be one of the "foundations of human intelligence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This ability allows us to make much more abstract and complex associations and inferences than if we were forced to think of each concept within a specific, concrete context," he asserts. In other words, humans can decontextualize their memories to create more abstract thought.&lt;/p&gt;

The 10-3-2-1-0 is a presleep routine that helps you relax and signals both your body and mind that it's time to wind down. Here is everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10 hours before bed: no more caffeine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most commonly consumed &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400203/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;psychoactive substance&lt;/a&gt; in the world. Caffeine consumption should ideally end 10 hours before bed since it can disrupt your sleep-wake cycle when consumed closer to bedtime. The half-life of a single dose of caffeine is about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4400203/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;three to seven hours&lt;/a&gt;, so your body takes a minimum of 10 hours to eliminate caffeine from your bloodstream. This is a good general rule, but 10 hours may be too rigid for some as sensitivity to caffeine varies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with coffee, caffeine may also be present in other &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/3-drinks-you-should-avoid-before-bed/" target="_self"&gt;drinks&lt;/a&gt;, such as sports drinks, soda, energy drinks, some teas and chocolate. Certain &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/count-down-not-sheep-good-nights-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;medications&lt;/a&gt; may also contain caffeine. You must read the labels of medications or &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/4-reasons-your-nightly-drink-is-causing-bad-sleep-and-what-to-do-about-it/" target="_self"&gt;drinks&lt;/a&gt; you're consuming, to avoid caffeine consumption around your bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3 hours before bed: no more food or alcohol &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although consumption of alcohol before bed may seem to be relaxing, it is a common &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;disruptor&lt;/a&gt; of sleep. It leads to decreased sleep quality and causes frequent overnight awakenings, which ultimately makes you feel tired throughout the next day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may also be beneficial to avoid consuming certain &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/the-foods-you-eat-can-help-you-sleep-catch-more-zzzs-with-these-7-yummy-snacks/" target="_self"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; three hours before bed, since they can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;heartburn (acid reflux)&lt;/a&gt; and disrupt sleep. A few such foods include fried, spicy and high-fat foods.

Relaxing your mind will help you prepare for sleep. You can &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sleep-hygiene" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;practice&lt;/a&gt; meditation, muscle relaxation and journaling to calm your mind after work. This helps to create a buffer time zone between your work and sleep time, allowing your brain to slow down and promoting a better quality of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1 hour before bed: no more screens &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's suggested to avoid using smartphones, televisions, computers, tablets or other devices at least one hour before bed &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; your actual bed. Blue light before bed is not generally recommended, it is not as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01791-7" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;disruptive as we once thought&lt;/a&gt;. Sleep experts still urge you to avoid using screens in your bed before trying to go to sleep. If your bed is the one place you scroll on your phone or watch TV the most, the body will associate your bed as a place to be awake; making it harder to fall asleep at night.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hit snooze 0 times in the morning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting the snooze button may disrupt your sleep cycle, making you feel &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/count-down-not-sheep-good-nights-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;more tired&lt;/a&gt;. It's often better to get up with one alarm. The sleep between the alarms is often fragmented and low quality, which may &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9804954/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;decrease&lt;/a&gt; your overall alertness and motivation throughout the day. Along with making you tired, snoozing alarms can also make you late for your daily activities. Additionally, getting up with the first alarm, even if it feels difficult initially, can help reinforce a consistent sleep-wake pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other sleep hygiene tips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oscar Wong/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few common tips that will help to maintain your sleep hygiene and ensure good &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/stop-sabotaging-your-sleep-quality-by-dropping-these-7-common-habits/" target="_self"&gt;quality &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/busting-7-popular-sleep-myths-and-the-real-tricks-to-get-better-rest/" target="_self"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; every night include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep electronics out of the bedroom: &lt;/strong&gt;Keeping electronics out of your bedroom will ensure you are not getting exposed to blue light from them, which can disrupt your sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a routine: &lt;/strong&gt;Creating a sleep routine prepares your body and mind for sleep. It signals to your body that it is time to sleep, ensuring timely and good-quality sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid late-night exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;Although exercise is good for your health, doing it one to two hours before bed can disrupt your sleep. Rigorous exercise close to your bedtime &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-activity/exercise-and-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;can&lt;/a&gt; increase your heart rate, adrenaline levels and body temperature, thereby making it difficult for you to fall asleep. Try gentle stretching or &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/sleep/hack-your-sleep-routine-with-these-9-simple-yoga-poses/" target="_self"&gt;yoga poses&lt;/a&gt;, instead. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep mid-day naps to 30 or shorter: &lt;/strong&gt;Keeping your naps to 15 to 20 minutes or shorter can keep you &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/myths-and-facts-about-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;energetic&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day. However, longer naps can interfere with your normal sleep time and make you feel lethargic and disoriented.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your bedroom dark: &lt;/strong&gt;Making your &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/myths-and-facts-about-sleep" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;bedroom dark&lt;/a&gt; ensures high-quality sleep. Even low light can increase your risk of nighttime awakenings and disrupt your sleep cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't watch TV or scroll on your phone in bed:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/doomscrolling-on-my-phone-ruins-my-quality-sleep/" target="_self"&gt;Scrolling&lt;/a&gt; your phone or watching TV in bed can associate your bed as a place to be awake. Try to only use your bed for sleep.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind your mind down before bed:&lt;/strong&gt; Winding your mind before bed ensures your mind is calm and your body is preparing to fall asleep. This, in turn, ensures you get high-quality sleep and do not experience any awakenings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Try this bedtime routine tonight &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yrabota/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better sleep means a better quality of life along with better mood, improved productivity and reduced stress. Instead of tossing and turning in your bed, try the 10-3-2-1-0 sleep routine. Although getting used to any routine is difficult, focus on gradual, sustainable changes rather than a perfect routine to reduce stress and anxiety about sleep. Hopefully, this advice will help you unwind and make falling asleep and getting good quality sleep easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNZWdjaUNjaW5GbUh5S0xUTWZCbzZ0eW11UnF3NE1yTm5RODVWb3NwcmY2TVd3OTFOZmNHdzA1Um5waUJvbG5iUlAwazRHLXhqZXgtQW1KRFVNUUVGaW5NOWVYNXBGb29KYmo0ZnQ0MUpWb2xzaHBqVjFYS0ozVExuUkdUZlBZVmMxbVU5dzUzaDFrZE5rUXRIeWpIa2daeU9tOXpUaTZ4SkpZZUNx</guid></item><item><title>Urgent recall of cat food 'infected with bird flu' - pet owners could be at risk of deadly disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQNkhiX1hjSWpaUjBlRmFYRlFrY0o4SXlzVnczdTlJaTlLS19zR1VWS0thRk5mdHVtek04WTdnQ01nYllaMmhnQWotcjZYeTVKVFAxN2RlWWlFbFd2T1VCell5MkE4elUwYlF0THc0TmNwLTJRYUtvQXFYbDF2VGNael9RTzNpOUZNanZNNi1PWEY1WFRVeGdjSmg2MEFPQdIBowFBVV95cUxQZC0xci1vOEVzdDBVaEUzNmkwTUh3NFBKRU4ySVl4RXR5aVlCTXZrVzNhUU1hMTNuNFhCWnRlc0RUa1Rib280RWxBbk5NWmxKaEg1X1dONUxWMHE3Y0NMc0RSSWxTWXQ3VGZET2VDNkRlSHcwVThWdFdJeEQzZ1o5Y2dxOHdfSUFCY1Z1dGRkZERsU3YzNHpaUHJWSzkwc0w1M1dB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A trendy brand of raw cat food has been urgently recalled amid fears it's contaminated with bird &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-a84630c0-fa98-11ef-b82d-0745da11c8bf" class=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; and could put pet owners at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US-based pet food brand, Wild Coast Raw, issued the &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-a84a2860-fa98-11ef-b82d-0745da11c8bf" class=""&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt; of its frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula following the death of a pet and tests of the food came back positive for the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/bird-flu/index.html" id="mol-276e8a60-fa9d-11ef-b263-d10e88c452cd"&gt;avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While no human cases have been reported, there are fears pet owners who handled the food, and then touched their eyes, nose or mouth, could be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials from the US Food and Drug Administration have urged people who handled suspect batches of the pet food to watch for potential bird flu symptoms.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People who handled contaminated products should watch for symptoms of bird flu, including eye redness or irritation (conjunctivitis), cough, sore throat, sneezing, runny/stuffy nose, muscle/body aches, headaches, fatigue, fever, trouble breathing, seizures, rash, diarrhoea, nausea, and/or vomiting,' a notice from the agency reads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People exhibiting these signs after having contact with this product should contact their healthcare provider and local health department.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Owners who have already fed the food to their pets have also been warned to look out for the symptoms in their cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wild Coast founder Tyler Duncan said they issued the recall following the death of a pet that was recently fed their product ‘out of an abundance of caution’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;At least 99 domestic cats have been infected with bird flu since late 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;US-based pet food brand, Wild Coast Raw, has issued a recall of its cat food due to possible contamination with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The safety of our products and that of our customers’ beloved pets is always our top priority.

&lt;p&gt;FORT WORTH, Texas — A Fort Worth pastor is celebrating his school's distinction as &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-texas-vaccine-vaccination-rates-schools-dfw-fort-worth-dallas/287-1c321c7d-d1ff-4326-ae9b-eec5c9100699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the least-vaccinated school&lt;/a&gt; in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture pastor Landon Schott, whose Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy has a measles vaccination rate of 14.29%, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG1I-g-xAPx/?igsh=MTJtaTdsemV1b2Nwcg%253D%253D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;posted a video on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; congratulating Mercy Culture Prep families "that embrace freedom of health."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're not allowing the government or science projects to affect how you live and lead your life," Schott said. "I know the entire world was shut down with insanity and people were fired from their jobs for forced vaccinations, and freedom is something we take seriously."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schott was posting the video in front of balloons and as he posed with a t-shirt that declared Mercy Culture Prep as the least-vaccinated school in the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture Prep's vaccination rate -- which is required to be reported to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services -- drew attention last week amid heightened awareness over a measles outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFAA's previous reporting showed that Mercy Culture Prep had the lowest MMR vaccination rate in Texas, at 14.29%, among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next-lowest number for MMR vaccination rate in North Texas was 38.10% at Collin County Cornerstone Christian Academy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most North Texas schools and districts have vaccination rates above 75%, and numerous vaccination rates are in the upper 90% range. About 62 North Texas schools had a 100% vaccination rate among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So shoutout to MC Prep for being the least vaccinated school in Texas," Schott said in his video. "We'll take it. Or as Mercy Culture says, we celebrate it. We'll put it on the board."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreak was mostly limited to West Texas – there was one case confirmed in an adult in North Texas (Rockwall County) – public health officials and doctors warned that vaccination is the best defense against spreading the rare virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth&lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; previously told WFAA.&lt;/a&gt; "We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;A Pennsylvania infant brought measles back from travel. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/measles-cases-reported-philadelphia-area-and-texas-traveler" target="_blank"&gt;CIDRAP&lt;/a&gt;. The family was on the China Airlines shuttle bus from JFK Airport to North Philadelphia late the night of 2-25, at True North Pediatrics in Plymouth Meeting, PA from 11:15 am to 2:15 pm on the 26th, and at CHOP Emergency Department in King of Prussia, PA between 1 and 3pm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A King County, WA infant with measles was at the Apple Store in Bellevue Square, the Seattle Children's Hospital emergency department, Allegro Pediatrics in Bothell, and Northwest Asthma and Allergy Center in Redmond on about Feb. 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Austin Texas infant also brought home measles from abroad, but the whole family was vaccinated and are isolating at home, no spread is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak has grown to 159, with 22 hospitalized.  Florida has entered the chat also, with Palmetto High School in Miami reporting a case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wild Coast Raw has recalled their Boneless Free Range Chicken raw cat food, after it was linked to more illnesses in Washington cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mystery illness in DR Congo is being tested for both pathogens and possible organo-phosphate poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uganda Ebola outbreak may not be entirely over.  A 4 year old child died, and it turns out his mother and sister had died earlier, untested and undiagnosed, their bodies were already buried.&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/two-fatal-probable-cases-reported-ugandas-ebola-sudan-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;This may imply spread not being caught.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B only infects humans, not animals.  I did not know that.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Just a few days of eating a diet high in saturated fat could be enough to cause memory problems and related brain inflammation in older adults, a new study in rats suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers fed separate groups of young and old rats the high-fat diet for three days or for three months to compare how quickly changes happen in the brain versus the rest of the body when eating an unhealthy diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected based on previous diabetes and obesity research, eating fatty foods for three months led to metabolic problems, gut inflammation and dramatic shifts in gut bacteria in all rats compared to those that ate normal chow, while just three days of high fat caused no major metabolic or gut changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to changes in the brain, however, researchers found that only older rats – whether they were on the high-fat diet for three months or only three days – performed poorly on memory tests and showed negative inflammatory changes in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="image_resized image-style-align-left" src="https://content.presspage.com/uploads/2170/500_barrientos-ruth-724x840.jpeg?x=1741198155259" alt="Ruth Barrientos"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results dispel the idea that diet-related inflammation in the aging brain is driven by obesity, said senior study author &lt;a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/clinical/psychiatry-and-behavioral-health/ruth-m-barrientos-phd"&gt;Ruth Barrientos&lt;/a&gt;, an investigator in the &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/neurological-institute/departments-and-centers/research-centers/institute-for-behavioral-medicine-research"&gt;Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research&lt;/a&gt; at The Ohio State University. Most research on the effects of fatty and processed foods on the brain has focused on obesity, yet the impact of unhealthy eating, independent of obesity, remains largely unexplored. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unhealthy diets and obesity are linked, but they are not inseparable. We’re really looking for the effects of the diet directly on the brain. And we showed that within three days, long before obesity sets in, tremendous neuroinflammatory shifts are occurring,” said Barrientos, also an associate professor of &lt;a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/departments/psychiatry-and-behavioral-health"&gt;psychiatry and behavioral health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://medicine.osu.edu/departments/neuroscience"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio State’s College of Medicine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in the body in all animals are happening more slowly and aren’t actually necessary to cause the memory impairments and changes in the brain. We never would have known that brain inflammation is the primary cause of high-fat diet-induced memory impairments without comparing the two timelines.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published recently in the journal &lt;a href="https://immunityageing.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12979-024-00496-3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Immunity &amp;amp; Ageing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of research in Barrientos’ lab has suggested that aging brings on long-term “priming” of the brain’s inflammatory profile coupled with a loss of brain-cell reserve to bounce back, and that an unhealthy diet can make matters worse for the brain in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fat constitutes 60% of calories in the high-fat diet used in the study, which could equate to a range of common fast-food options: For example, nutrition data shows that fat makes up about 60% of calories in a McDonald’s &lt;a href="https://fastfoodnutrition.org/mcdonalds/smoky-blt-quarter-pounder-with-cheese/double"&gt;double smoky BLT quarter pounder with cheese&lt;/a&gt; or a Burger King &lt;a href="https://fastfoodnutrition.org/burger-king/double-whopper"&gt;double whopper with cheese&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the animals were on high-fat diets for three days or three months, researchers ran tests assessing two types of memory problems common in older people with dementia that are based in separate regions of the brain: contextual memory mediated by the &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/hippocampus-what-to-know"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; (the primary memory center of the brain), and cued-fear memory that originates in the &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/amygdala-what-to-know"&gt;amygdala&lt;/a&gt; (the fear and danger center of the brain). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to control animals eating chow and young rats on the high-fat diet, aged rats showed behaviors indicating both types of memory were impaired after only three days of fatty food – and the behaviors persisted as they continued on the high-fat diet for three months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also saw changes in levels of a range of proteins called cytokines in the brains of aged rats after three days of fatty food, which signaled a dysregulated inflammatory response. Three months after being on the high-fat diet, some of the cytokine levels had shifted but remained dysregulated, and the cognitive problems persisted in behavior tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A departure from baseline inflammatory markers is a negative response and has been shown to impair learning and memory functions,” Barrientos said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to rats eating normal chow, young and old animals gained more weight and showed signs of metabolic dysfunction – poor insulin and blood sugar control, inflammatory proteins in fat (adipose) tissue, and gut microbiome alterations – after three months on the high-fat diet. Young rats’ memory and behavior and brain tissue remained unaffected by the fatty food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These diets lead to obesity-related changes in both young and old animals, yet young animals appear more resilient to the high-fat diet’s effects on memory. We think it is likely due to their ability to activate compensatory anti-inflammatory responses, which the aged animals lack,” Barrientos said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, with glucose, insulin and adipose inflammation all increased in both young and old animals, there’s no way to distinguish what is causing memory impairment in only old animals if you look only at what’s happening in the body. It’s what is happening in the brain that’s important for the memory response.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was supported by grants from the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-authors include Michael Butler, Stephanie Muscat, Brigitte González Olmo, Sabrina Mackey-Alfonso, Nashali Massa, Bryan Alvarez, Jade Blackwell, Menaz Bettes and James DeMarsh of Ohio State; and Maria Elisa Caetano-Silva, Akriti Shrestha, Robert McCusker and Jacob Allen of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A naturally occurring molecule identified by Stanford Medicine researchers appears similar to semaglutide—also known as Ozempic—in suppressing appetite and reducing body weight. Notably, testing in animals also showed that it worked without some of the drug's side effects, such as nausea, constipation and significant loss of muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The newly discovered molecule, BRP, acts through a separate but similar metabolic pathway and activates different neurons in the brain—seemingly offering a more targeted approach to body weight reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The receptors targeted by semaglutide are found in the brain but also in the gut, pancreas and other tissues," said assistant professor of pathology Katrin Svensson, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's why Ozempic has widespread effects, including slowing the movement of food through the digestive tract and lowering blood sugar levels. In contrast, BRP appears to act specifically in the hypothalamus, which controls appetite and metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svensson has co-founded a company to launch clinical trials of the molecule in humans in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svensson is the senior author of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08683-y" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, which was published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;. Senior research scientist Laetitia Coassolo, Ph.D., is the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study would not have been possible without the use of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to weed through dozens of proteins in a class called prohormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prohormones are biologically inert molecules that become active when they are cleaved by other proteins into smaller pieces called peptides; some of these peptides then function as hormones to regulate complex biological outcomes, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, in the brain and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each prohormone can be divided in a variety of ways to create a plethora of functional peptide progeny. But with traditional methods of protein isolation, it's difficult to pick peptide hormones (which are relatively rare) out of the biological soup of the much more numerous natural byproducts of protein degradation and processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the prohormone convertase 1/3 (also known as PCSK1/3), which separates prohormones at specific amino acid sequences and is known to be involved in human obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the peptide products is glucagon-like peptide 1, or GLP-1, which regulates appetite and blood sugar levels; semaglutide works by mimicking the effect of GLP-1 in the body. The team turned to artificial intelligence to help them identify other peptides involved in energy metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Peptide Predictor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of manually isolating proteins and peptides from tissues and using techniques like &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mass+spectrometry/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mass spectrometry&lt;/a&gt; to identify hundreds of thousands of peptides, the researchers designed a computer algorithm they named "Peptide Predictor" to identify typical prohormone convertase cleavage sites in all 20,000 human protein-coding genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They then focused on genes that encode proteins that are secreted outside the cell—a key characteristic of hormones—and that have four or more possible cleavage sites. Doing so narrowed down the search to 373 prohormones, a manageable number to screen for their biological effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The algorithm was absolutely key to our findings," Svensson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peptide Predictor predicted that prohormone convertase 1/3 would generate 2,683 unique peptides from the 373 proteins. Coassolo and Svensson focused on sequences likely to be biologically active in the brain. They screened 100 peptides, including GLP-1, for their ability to activate lab-grown neuronal cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the GLP-1 peptide had a robust effect on the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neuronal+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neuronal cells&lt;/a&gt;, increasing their activity threefold over control cells. But a small peptide made up of just 12 amino acids bumped up the cells' activity 10-fold over controls. The researchers named this peptide BRP based on its parent prohormone, BPM/retinoic acid inducible neural specific 2, or BRINP2 (BRINP2-related-peptide).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;When the researchers tested the effect of BRP on lean mice and minipigs (which more closely mirror human metabolism and eating patterns than mice do), they found that an intramuscular injection of BRP prior to feeding reduced food intake over the next hour by up to 50% in both animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obese mice treated with daily injections of BRP for 14 days lost an average of 3 grams—due almost entirely to fat loss—while control animals gained about 3 grams over the same period. The mice also demonstrated improved glucose and insulin tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies of the mice and pigs found no differences in the treated animals' movements, water intake, anxiety-like behavior or fecal production. And further studies of physiological and brain activity showed that BRP activates metabolic and neuronal pathways separate from those activated by GLP-1 or semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope to identify the cell-surface receptors that bind BRP and to further dissect the pathways of its action. They are also investigating how to help the peptide's effects last longer in the body to allow a more convenient dosing schedule if the peptide proves to be effective in regulating human body weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The lack of effective drugs to treat obesity in humans has been a problem for decades," Svensson said. "Nothing we've tested before has compared to semaglutide's ability to decrease appetite and body weight. We are very eager to learn if it is safe and effective in humans."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Minnesota; and the University of British Columbia contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Svensson and Coassolo are inventors on patents regarding BRP &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/peptides/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;peptides&lt;/a&gt; for metabolic disorders. Svensson is a co-founder of Merrifield Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cracking the window open in vehicles can also help to 'improve airflow and reduce airborne virus concentration'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Detwiler recommends keeping your hands away from your face as your eyes, nose, and mouth are direct entry points for pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Moving through TSA security&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TSA security checkpoints are one of the dirtiest areas in an airport, Dr Detwiler warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says: 'Much like old days when public pay phones were the most handled (and contaminated) surfaces, today those plastic security bins harbor more respiratory viruses than public toilets.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To prevent the spread of germs, he recommends using hand sanitizer immediately after touching the security bins, conveyor belts, or fingerprint scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also advises carrying a paper boarding pass or use mobile check-in to avoid using touch screen monitors, which harbor germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you want to take your safety protocols up a notch, Dr Detwiler adds: 'You could consider wearing disposable gloves, but remember to remove them safely and sanitize afterward.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Darin Detwiler previously served as a public health expert for the FDA specializing in foodborne illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Navigating the terminal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With thousands of travelers from all over the world passing through each day, Dr Detwiler says terminals are high-risk areas for airborne illnesses like measles, flu, and RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, the health expert says wearing a facemask is a good idea, despite being out of the Covid pandemic era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recommends KN95 and N95 masks, as both are rated to filter out at least 95 percent of particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you don't feel comfortable wearing it all the time, Dr Detwiler says it is essential to where masks in crowded areas if you want to maximize your safety,&lt;span&gt; 'particularly at security, near gate seating, and in restrooms'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other tips he offers to avoid germs is to maintain distance &lt;/span&gt;from anyone visibly ill (especially in boarding lines), to use your phone instead of self-check-in kiosks and shared touchscreens and to stay hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elaborating on his last tip, he explains: 'Dry air suppresses your immune system, making you more susceptible to infection, so it's best to keep a drink with you at all times.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Safely enjoying airport lounges &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Detwiler says premium airport lounges may offer a quieter atmosphere, but they're not immune to contamination, 'especially when it comes to shared food stations and high-touch surfaces'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, he advises avoiding self-serve buffets and opting for&lt;span&gt; packaged or made-to-order meals instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also recommends disinfecting tables and seating areas before eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another area of airport lounges he says is riddled with germs is the washroom and shower facilities, so he always uses a napkin or paper towel to open bathroom doors and touch faucets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Boarding the flight and being on the plane&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once you step onto a plane, you're in close quarters with hundreds of people for hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Detwiler says High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters used on planes remove 99.9 percent of airborne particles such as dust, bacteria, and viruses, the biggest risk is proximity to other passengers - especially if you're sitting close to someone coughing or sneezing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former FDA employee who is also an ardent traveler, says when he flies he always picks a window seat as &lt;span&gt;you'll have fewer encounters with passing passengers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then always keeps his air vent open and directed slightly downward to 'create an airflow barrier'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And before taking his seat, he uses sanitizing wipes to clean high touch areas, including the tray table, armrests, seatbelt buckle, and touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of Dr Detwiler's biggest no-nos while flying is using the seatback pockets, because he says they are rarely disinfected and may harbor bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Arrival and post-flight precautions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Think you're safe once you've landed? Think again, says Dr Detwiler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He reveals that the baggage claim area, customs, and ground transportation all present new risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plus, he highlights that 'exhaustion can make you more vulnerable as you are less alert and it is easy to let your guard down'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To keep your health in check, he says the first step is sanitizing your hands after collecting your luggage, as your 'bag has been tossed around and handled by multiple people, moving along on conveyor belts, trolleys, and cargo holds'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He then says it is best to keep your mask on in customs and baggage claim as these areas are still crowded with travelers from all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On returning home or arriving at a hotel, the final step is to shower and change into clean clothes as soon as possible - especially after long-haul flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 14:33:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>North Texas pastor celebrates school's lowest vaccination rate in the state: 'We'll take it' - WFAA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgJBVV95cUxPcFh3bThxVkREbE8xUkxTc1FqbWtvbGhPTGl2dTRWeUtsZGh1bFJweHVXNHhWUUNoM1RVcHEyRllnS0ViYlpxQ0NsNnF2Q0F1T1gyQU15c0t4bEdLazB5TXpjVjExZ0p2V2ktRWF6Zm1vY2xWd2RiUlF0UktzMF9jUFlXc0xFeHoteXpIOVRwZ1ZycVlaU3JpN2toTHM5T1ZJYzg2NklaU0w1TFVrZW81OElvY0tSenpVVS1zSXNYeVRiMHJBM0kwam04aEV3RFdaQnlJZ29aUnlhLWFHTVphSDdwRV9nSy1DSktCeEo0Z1FXbFVFM1ZjME9aT2FENXJmaFVLRkw1dldXMGtHdlV5Q2w1Qk9nYlZFY0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Mercy Culture pastor Landon Schott, whose Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy has a measles vaccination rate of 14.29%, posted a video on Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FORT WORTH, Texas — A Fort Worth pastor is celebrating his school's distinction as &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles-texas-vaccine-vaccination-rates-schools-dfw-fort-worth-dallas/287-1c321c7d-d1ff-4326-ae9b-eec5c9100699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;the least-vaccinated school&lt;/a&gt; in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture pastor Landon Schott, whose Mercy Culture Preparatory Academy has a measles vaccination rate of 14.29%, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DG1I-g-xAPx/?igsh=MTJtaTdsemV1b2Nwcg%253D%253D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;posted a video on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; congratulating Mercy Culture Prep families "that embrace freedom of health."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They're not allowing the government or science projects to affect how you live and lead your life," Schott said. "I know the entire world was shut down with insanity and people were fired from their jobs for forced vaccinations, and freedom is something we take seriously."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schott was posting the video in front of balloons and as he posed with a t-shirt that declared Mercy Culture Prep as the least-vaccinated school in the state.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mercy Culture Prep's vaccination rate -- which is required to be reported to the Texas Department of Health and Human Services -- drew attention last week amid heightened awareness over a measles outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFAA's previous reporting showed that Mercy Culture Prep had the lowest MMR vaccination rate in Texas, at 14.29%, among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year. The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next-lowest number for MMR vaccination rate in North Texas was 38.10% at Collin County Cornerstone Christian Academy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most North Texas schools and districts have vaccination rates above 75%, and numerous vaccination rates are in the upper 90% range. About 62 North Texas schools had a 100% vaccination rate among kindergartners in the 2023-2024 school year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So shoutout to MC Prep for being the least vaccinated school in Texas," Schott said in his video. "We'll take it. Or as Mercy Culture says, we celebrate it. We'll put it on the board."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the measles outbreak was mostly limited to West Texas – there was one case confirmed in an adult in North Texas (Rockwall County) – public health officials and doctors warned that vaccination is the best defense against spreading the rare virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is "probably the most infectious contagious disease on the planet," said Dr. Suzanne Whitworth, division chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Cook Children's in Fort Worth&lt;a href="/article/news/health/answers-to-your-questions-and-general-guidelines-on-measles-outbreak-in-texas/287-48e4c451-22e5-403b-b810-bfda235c3d03" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; previously told WFAA.&lt;/a&gt; "We know that about 40% of kids under the age of five who get measles are gonna wind up in the hospital, and nobody wants that."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dietary habits of patients were assessed at the time of their diagnosis and disability progression was tracked for up to 15 years. While greater benefits were observed in those who regularly ate fish since their diagnosis, patients who increased their fish intake in the years after being diagnosed also saw reductions in the risk of disability progression over those who continued to eat little to no fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest “diet, particularly fish consumption, as a modifiable factor that could complement existing therapeutic strategies for MS,” the study’s researchers wrote in “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2025/02/04/jnnp-2024-335200"&gt;Impact of fish consumption on disability progression in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” which was published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system launches damaging attacks on the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt; that protects nerve cells, causing &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. As damage accumulates over time, patients see worsening symptoms that cause disability levels to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; can slow the progression of disability, they cannot completely prevent it, so additional measures are needed to improve a person’s long-term outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence touts the benefits of a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/expert-voices/2021/12/15/expert-voices-diet-nutrition-supplements-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; in slowing disease progression. For example, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/10/17/mediterranean-diet-associated-lower-disability-risk-study/"&gt;a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, rich in fish and other healthy foods like vegetables, is linked to less disability, with older patients also reporting &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/04/09/mediterranean-diet-benefits-older-ms-patients-study/"&gt;better quality of life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Eat more fish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden drew on data from 2,719 patients in a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ane.12425"&gt;Swedish MS registry&lt;/a&gt; to explore whether eating more fish could slow disability progression. The registry included patients diagnosed between 2005 and 2015 who responded at enrollment to a questionnaire about environmental exposures and lifestyle habits. The patients were followed for up to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of fish they consumed had no impact on their disability levels, as assessed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), at the time of enrollment. However, those who reported eating fish weekly had a significantly lower risk of confirmed disability progression throughout the follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, eating lean fish each week such as cod, haddock, and whiting was linked to a 16% lower risk of confirmed disability worsening compared with seldom eating lean fish. Eating oily fish —  herring, mackerel, tuna, salmon, and trout — each week was linked to a 19% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirmed disability worsening was defined as an increase in the EDSS score confirmed in a follow-up medical visit at least six months later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fish intake frequency score that captured the broader pattern of lean and oily fish also showed that patients with the highest fish intake had a 34% lower risk of confirmed disability worsening than those who never or rarely ate fish. They also had a 45% lower risk of reaching an EDSS score of 3 (moderate disability) and a 43% lower risk of reaching an EDSS score of 4 (significant disability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Increasing fish consumption after an MS diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, 1,719 patients completed a follow-up questionnaire. Based on their answers, the researchers found that 288 patients increased their fish consumption after being diagnosed and 124 decreased their fish intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of eating fish were greater among those who continued to eat fish regularly. But increasing fish intake could still have benefits in confirmed disability progression over the long term. For example, those who increased their consumption from the lowest scores of 2-3 to the highest scores of 5-6 in the five years after their diagnosis had a 20% lower risk of disability progression than those who continued with low fish consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects were similar after weighing other factors that may influence disability progression, including physical activity, weight, smoking, alcohol intake, and sun exposure. They also remained similar when adjusted for &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/vitamin-d-ms-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that higher fish consumption is associated with a reduced risk of disability progression in MS, likely due to the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of nutrients found in fish,” wrote the researchers, who said more studies are needed to validate the results and “investigate the underlying biological mechanisms.” Future studies could also help determine if adding more lean and oily fish to the diet should become part of MS treatment plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2025 13:42:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOSi16c2E5SGxxeWtISUhwZTRBUjh3Q1hrVjBCc2lhbUwtSTlLNHhSZEFseERaQnRQcU1KaXBrcllmOS1RYXZ2ZjljV2tVNFRUeFpRRWJnM2VnOVFxYnM3MmxCMDVnWWlOd0hmSU5DRG1MR2tfOFlTeTdpTUVUWGw3enJJaF9YZF9tZzBZdk9hTjNhc3M3YXRkb2N2alB0NkRaOUdIbjg3aVNYQzBJX3FudFZ3ZmJwQmp3a04w</guid></item><item><title>As tuberculosis cases rise in the US and worldwide, health officials puzzle over the resurgence of a disease once in decline - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7wFBVV95cUxQZTU3ZHVsZ05DMFc0YmpoeFdaSmtKN25vNkZqNE9RVEk5QVhoNnJTOFkwRTZzSnJVVkotc2N1bnM4ampUWG5sUDVrOEVmZHRzZ1VpYTRMRmRjcWJpZ2RfcVBqZFQ3cU8wejRhckFIc04tUllWYllfYzlNZGdmTGRka0hHRUVxRk9iN0I4XzNybU5aNVA1U3ZxWjhpd0tjV1JxRnMyZlNJaGoySnp6SnBHTDN2My1CNnhOcWNwVWNxT2tOeGxBYy04S05vY1MzMGQxNkdjSUV2Z3pvQ0VTcGRzVG5jVnBGNkFDUGkzTWRraw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An outbreak of tuberculosis, or TB – a lung disease that is often accompanied by a hacking cough – began in January 2024 in Kansas City, Kansas, and two nearby counties and &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;continues as of early March 2025&lt;/a&gt;. To date, 147 people have been reportedly diagnosed with TB in the outbreak, with 67 becoming ill. The remaining 80 people diagnosed with TB in Kansas contracted the illness but showed no symptoms, which is called a latent infection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TB is the leading infectious cause of death around the world, outpaced only by &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;COVID-19 during the first three years of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Conversation asked microbiologists &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zEgCkh0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Karen Dobos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZdujPQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Marcela Henao-Tamayo&lt;/a&gt;, both from Colorado State University, to explain why this ancient disease seems to be making a comeback.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What’s the history of TB?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; is the organism that causes the disease &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html"&gt;tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; in humans. The disease has been infecting humans for thousands of years. Researchers found evidence of the disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003426"&gt;9,000 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in the excavated remains of people who lived in the Eastern Mediterranean region during that time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports of TB date back to around 410-400 B.C.E., when the physician Hippocrates termed the disease phthisis, an archaic word that means a progressive “wasting away,” due to the way &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;people with the disease become emaciated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TB was also known as consumption for the same reason. Similarly, it was called the white plague or white death – due to anemia from the disease, with people appearing pallid or chalky – leading to near-certain death. Untreated active TB, meaning cases that are symptomatic, is highly lethal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half of all people with untreated active TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/tb-disease-burden/2-2-tb-mortality"&gt;die from the disease&lt;/a&gt;, whereas treatment &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment/2-3-tb-treatment--coverage-and-outcomes#"&gt;reduces the death rate to 12%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more colorful phrases describing TB is “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.318.7199.1705"&gt;the king’s evil&lt;/a&gt;.” This is a form of TB that also causes neck swelling and lesions, a condition called scrofula. During the Middle Ages, people believed that the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/3/AC-2803_article"&gt;touch of a king&lt;/a&gt; could cure a person from this form of TB through miraculous intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/lungs-affected-by-miliary-tuberculosis-royalty-free-illustration/1786411740?phrase=tuberculosis&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, TB was most ominously called the “robber of youth” due to its historical propensity to &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-59178487/JMVH%20Vol%2022%20No%202"&gt;afflict people 15 to 30 years old&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1865, Jean Antoine Villemin, an army physician in Paris, demonstrated that TB could be transmitted from infected animals to healthy ones through inoculation. Before these studies, the cause of TB was &lt;a href="https://jmvh.org/article/history-of-tuberculosis-part-1-phthisis-consumption-and-the-white-plague/"&gt;presumed to be primarily constitutional&lt;/a&gt;, by either an inherent predisposition or from unhealthy or immoral lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microorganism causing TB was ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#"&gt;discovered in 1882&lt;/a&gt; by the German physician Robert Koch. Koch announced his findings on March 24, 1882, a day globally recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-tb-day"&gt;World TB Day&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How does TB spread?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis is spread by small infectious droplets in the air. A TB patient may emit these droplets by coughing, singing and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202110-2378OC"&gt;potentially from regular breathing that occurs during sleep or resting&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One form of TB can be spread through &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.02.091"&gt;unpasteurized dairy products&lt;/a&gt;. While rare, there have been reports of TB &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/pdfs/mm725253-H.pdf"&gt;transmission through bone graphs&lt;/a&gt;, in which healthy, donated bone material is used to replace damaged bones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/652866/original/file-20250304-56-tcty3a.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Close-up view of an infection by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/illustration/secondary-tuberculosis-infection-royalty-free-illustration/1042128494?phrase=tuberculosis&amp;amp;searchscope=image,film&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origin of the TB outbreak in Kansas remains unknown as of early March 2025. The outbreak has disproportionately affected those in low-income communities, and two people have died from it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, a patient with untreated TB &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;can infect 10 to 15 others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Could the COVID-19 pandemic be a factor?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has played a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2022/covid-19-and-tb?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;pivotal role in the resurgence of TB&lt;/a&gt;. Cases &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?"&gt;increased globally by 4.6% from 2020 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;, reversing decades of steady declines in the disease. In the U.S. alone, TB cases rose by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb-surveillance-report-2023/summary/index.html"&gt;more than 15% from 2022 to 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During mandatory shutdowns, people were &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMp2118145"&gt;less able to access health care centers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.891711"&gt;early diagnosis of TB&lt;/a&gt; or to fill prescriptions for treatment, perhaps due to the fear of contracting COVID-19 while visiting a medical care facility. COVID-19-related disruptions in care &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024"&gt;resulted in nearly 700,000 excess deaths from TB&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to health care may not be the only factor behind this uptick. Medical supply shortages and delays in shipment may have also played a role. For example, the U.S. experienced &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/php/dear-colleague-letters/2023-tb-drug-shortages.html"&gt;shortages of one of the primary TB drugs&lt;/a&gt; between 2021 and 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/652995/original/file-20250304-56-6124ni.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;As illustrated by this 1963 photo, TB is often detected by an X-ray of the chest.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/here-a-physician-and-nurse-examine-a-tuberculosis-positive-news-photo/579371112?adppopup=true"&gt;Smith Collection/Gado/Archive Photos via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What are the main treatments?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multidrug treatment is currently the only way to cure TB and stop its spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to the late 1930s, when the first antibiotic for TB treatment was developed, TB treatments included bloodletting and consumption of cod liver oil. The most popular treatment involved isolated sanatoriums in high-altitude areas such as the Adirondacks and the Rocky Mountains, where the cold, dry air was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/4574446"&gt;believed to be a cure&lt;/a&gt;. Scholars at the time suggested that the potential for cure was due to these environments being more &lt;a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;amp;httpsredir=1&amp;amp;article=1017&amp;amp;context=unm_bulletin"&gt;invigorating for the body and providing more restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;. There is no evidence to support these beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streptomycin was the first antibiotic treatment to become available for TB, in the 1940s. However, the microorganism quickly became drug resistant. A second antibiotic, called isoniazid, was developed as a first-line treatment &lt;a href="https://doi-ds.org/doilink/11.2021-98726273/JMVH"&gt;against TB in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. Again, the microorganism became drug resistant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two- and four-drug combinations are now used to treat both latent infections and active disease. Treatment of active TB requires at least six months of uninterrupted therapy. Disruptions in treatment result in further spread of TB and the emergence of multidrug resistant TB, which requires additional drugs and more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/tb-diagnosis-and-treatment"&gt;nine months of treatment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All TB drugs are toxic; the quality of life for TB patients &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.22.0514"&gt;deteriorates during treatment&lt;/a&gt; and remains so throughout their lives. Finding cases and treating TB illness early, before symptoms begin, is important because it not only reduces the spread of disease but also greatly reduces drug toxicity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What should people be aware of?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People should be aware that TB is still a public health problem across the globe. Education on the transmission, treatment and need for active work to eradicate TB is the best defense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why education and awareness about TB are so important is that a person with latent TB may be unknowingly harboring the microorganism for years. In the absence of symptoms, these people are unlikely to seek care and will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(24)00028-6"&gt;not be diagnosed and treated&lt;/a&gt; unless identified as part of an outbreak, as was the case for more than half of the patients in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Researchers followed 11,745 adults over 14.5 years and found that those who used NSAIDs long-term had a 12% reduced dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, short- and intermediate-term NSAID use did not provide the same benefit, nor was the total cumulative dose linked to risk reduction.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new large prospective study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/em&gt; provides additional evidence, showing that long-term NSAID use is linked to a decreased risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the population-based study of 11,745 adults with an average follow-up of 14.5 years, 9,520 participants had used NSAIDs at any given time, and 2,091 participants developed dementia. Long-term NSAID use was associated with a 12% reduced risk of developing dementia. Short- and intermediate-term use did not provide benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the cumulative dose of NSAIDs was not associated with decreased dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that prolonged, rather than intensive, use of anti-inflammatory medications may help protect against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides evidence on possible preventive effects of anti-inflammatory medication against the dementia process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a need for more studies to further consolidate this evidence and possibly develop preventive strategies,” said corresponding author M.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes might be the bane of a summer barbecue in Kendall or a stroll on Miami Beach, but researchers in Florida are now also looking at the insects' more obscure targets—and how even a tiny, orange-flapped lizard could play a role in protecting our health.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;While itchy bumps might make us feel like &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mosquitoes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt; solely target humans, most of the world's 3,600 mosquito species don't specifically target humans, and the ones known in Florida bite humans, birds, amphibians, and reptiles like the brown anole, a pencil-sized lizard with a signature orange gullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though these lizards are fast and feisty when they're out hunting for insects, they rest on branches and leaves through the evenings and nights, making them an easy target for mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown anoles, said Melissa Miller, an invasion ecologist at the University of Florida, "may unwittingly be helping humans by absorbing the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mosquito+bites/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mosquito bites&lt;/a&gt;, and decreasing the transmission of serious pathogens to humans."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news for human health, Miller and her colleagues believe, is that the anole population is being squeezed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of decades ago, reptile collectors inadvertently started a turf war by releasing Peter's rock agamas they'd kept as pets into the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how much the male anoles spread their gullet, technically called a dewlap, to make themselves appear bigger and more&lt;br&gt;
dangerous, the agamas—up to three times the size of the little anoles—were unimpressed. The agamas quickly spread, ate the anoles' food and, sometimes, their little cousins themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many areas, the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/anole/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;anole&lt;/a&gt; has disappeared, and the redheaded agama are now basking in the sun. While neither lizard is known to carry disease that mosquitoes can contract and then pass on to humans, the issue, Miller says, is the change in the mosquitoes' diet.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Fewer lizards to feed on&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early evening hours and throughout the night, mosquitoes can no longer feast on anoles, which typically sleep out in the open. Nor can they bite the agama, which hides in cracks and crevices as soon as the sun begins to set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With less lizard blood on the menu, Miller and her colleagues theorized, mosquitoes could be biting birds more often. At least from a human-health point of view, that's arguably the worst meal a mosquito could pick: Birds are some of the best hosts and multipliers of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And the more often they bite birds, the higher the chances that the mosquito picks up a pathogen" that they can then pass on to humans, Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the UF team caught mosquitoes at three specific sites where the agama has taken over, then used DNA analysis to show which animals the insects had feasted on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Miller and her colleagues had to become experts at catching the agile reptiles with sticks, nets and even their bare hands. When the anoles returned to their original habitat, the team again caught mosquitoes. With the anoles back on the menu, the researchers believe that this second batch of mosquitoes would have drawn more blood from anoles, not from disease-riddled birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, that would also mean that fewer mosquitoes carry viruses that could harm humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers are still waiting for results, but in a few months, they'll know exactly how the mosquito-bird-lizard-human transmission works. That, they hope, will add to our understanding of the unintended, often damaging consequences of human changes to the environment—like the introduction of non-native species like the agama, and the more notorious Burmese python, which has devastated the small mammal populations in the Everglades.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;That the large-scale burning of fossil fuels has warmed the planet by 2 degrees Fahrenheit, on average, is another factor. Whether any of the mosquito-borne diseases become endemic in Florida isn't just tied to the anoles, of course, but "will depend on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/global+warming/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;, and whether we start seeing more and more mosquitoes that stay year-round," said Dr. Joyti Somani, an infectious disease specialist who used to treat malaria, dengue and other mosquito-transmitted diseases in Singapore before joining Miami-Dade's Jackson Memorial Hospital last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Miami-Dade's Mosquito Control, division chief Dr. John-Paul Mutebi also said he worries that a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/warmer+climate/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;warmer climate&lt;/a&gt; enables some mosquito species to spread to regions that were previously too cold, and that the season they're most active is getting longer. Within the next 25 years, researchers project that the US mosquito season will last two months longer than today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That is really, really dangerous, because towards the end of the transmission period, that is when most of these mosquitoes are infected," Dr. Mutebi told the Herald. "They keep on picking up the pathogens as the season goes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika, and West Nile virus are among the diseases Dr. Mutebi lists as worrisome, as is eastern equine encephalitis. Also known as Triple E, the virus swells the brain and kills about one in three patients.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"If you don't die from it, you're going to end up with some long-lasting effects," Dr. Mutebi said, including permanent blindness, loss of hearing, or other physical and mental impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, the odds of contracting Triple E are almost trivially low. In 2023, Florida reported only two cases in humans. But contracting any mosquito-transmitted disease is a numbers game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more mosquitoes there are, the longer they stay active, and which species they bite all matters. With Florida under attack by &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/invasive+species/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;invasive species&lt;/a&gt;, from Burmese python to lionfish, the UF researchers hope that their results could help authorities direct resources to fighting the agama—and protecting the anoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Brown anoles seem like such a small component of the ecosystem," Miller said, "but even removing that can have impacts that are felt much higher up the food chain, all the way to humans."&lt;/p&gt;

                                        A new study offers some of the first evidence that postpartum depression is linked to changes in the brain, specifically in areas associated with processing and regulating emotions. Researchers performed MRIs on 88 first-time gestational mothers, both during late pregnancy and shortly after giving birth. The participants also filled out questionnaires evaluating prenatal and postnatal depression symptoms and childbirth experience. As in earlier research, researchers found parts of the brain shrunk during pregnancy, "possibly undergoing a fine-tuning process in preparation for parenting," per the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/health/postpartum-depression-brain.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;

                                        When their brain scans were compared to those of 30 women who had never given birth, the pregnant women were revealed to have smaller volumes in several regions of the amygdala, which plays a role in emotional processing, and the hippocampus, which helps regulate emotions. However, pregnant women with symptoms of depression showed increased volume of their amygdala. About 11% showed moderate depression symptoms during late pregnancy, while 17% did postpartum. "The larger the increase in the right amygdala volume, the greater the increase in symptoms of perinatal depression," per the study published Wednesday in &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt5619"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Furthermore, increases in hippocampal volumes were tied to a difficult or stressful birth experience. "The worse the birth experience, the larger the bilateral volume increase in the hippocampus." As stress can alter the structure and function of the hippocampus, a negatively perceived birth experience could be "driving the observed volumetric changes," the study notes. However, predisposing factors, such as fear of childbirth or a history of mental disorders" could also play a role. As &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/amygdala-activity-ppd-27651/"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports, it could also be that "pregnant women may struggle more with consciously regulating negative emotions."

Pictured with wife Jasmin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But the 35-year-old chef said he was repeatedly told it 'wasn't serious' and should pass 'in a week or so'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Mr Robinson is urging others not to be put off seeking help for potential signs of colon cancer, amid an explosion in cases of the disease in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling how the initial signs of his cancer were dismissed he said: ' I thought it was stress related, because it had come on rapidly while we were getting stuff ready for the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We were planning on a "princess wedding" but we were working very, very hard for it and I was working a minimum of 60 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It got really bad and I passed the most insane amount of blood so I phoned my GP and they told me to go to A&amp;amp;E straight away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I saw the doctor I mentioned to him that my great nan had died of colon cancer but he said there was no chance and that I was too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The wedding was so consuming and I was being told by every health professional that I definitely didn't have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were saying "you're fine, don't worry, go and get married" so I took their word for it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, after experiencing rapid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-cbbd1ec0-fa88-11ef-a0ed-7d508a30f2b9" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; following his wedding, Mr Robinson was still worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only after he suddenly passed 'an insane' amount of blood a month later in June that he rushed to A&amp;amp;E&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions.

I was told I had stage four colon cancer, which had spread to my liver. It was the worst news possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It absolutely crushed my wife.

Pictured with wife Jasmin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But the 35-year-old chef said he was repeatedly told it 'wasn't serious' and should pass 'in a week or so'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Mr Robinson is urging others not to be put off seeking help for potential signs of colon cancer, amid an explosion in cases of the disease in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling how the initial signs of his cancer were dismissed he said: ' I thought it was stress related, because it had come on rapidly while we were getting stuff ready for the wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We were planning on a "princess wedding" but we were working very, very hard for it and I was working a minimum of 60 hours per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It got really bad and I passed the most insane amount of blood so I phoned my GP and they told me to go to A&amp;amp;E straight away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I saw the doctor I mentioned to him that my great nan had died of colon cancer but he said there was no chance and that I was too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The wedding was so consuming and I was being told by every health professional that I definitely didn't have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They were saying "you're fine, don't worry, go and get married" so I took their word for it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, after experiencing rapid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-cbbd1ec0-fa88-11ef-a0ed-7d508a30f2b9" class=""&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; following his wedding, Mr Robinson was still worried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It was only after he suddenly passed 'an insane' amount of blood a month later in June that he rushed to A&amp;amp;E&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions.

&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard of “mommy makeovers” — but now the menopause makeover is the latest trend shaking up the wellness industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.drsmita.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Smita Ramanadham&lt;/a&gt; told The Post that her plastic surgery practice in New Jersey, once bustling with young women looking to bounce back after having children, is now seeing a fresh wave of middle-aged patients eager to address the aesthetic woes tied to “the change of life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My only regret is not doing it sooner so that I can enjoy it longer,” said Jennie Rodriquez, one of Ramanadham’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jennie Rodriquez after going under the knife. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The menopause effect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most women begin the menopausal transition between the ages of 45 and 55, a process that may last several years, a period known as perimenopause. You officially reach menopause when you haven’t had a period for 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings are typically associated with the transition, but menopause can also cause many bodily changes that affect your appearance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham said one of the most common complaints she hears from patients is weight gain due to hormonal fluctuations that change how fat is distributed in the body, particularly in the midsection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A lot of patients say they haven’t really changed their lifestyles in terms of diet or exercise, but it’s harder for that weight to come off compared to what worked for them in the past,” she said. “That leaves them feeling sort of frustrated.” &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham is also seeing more menopausal women seek out breast reductions after their busts grow larger during the transition, causing a wide range of problems. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s back pain, but it also starts to interfere with their lifestyles, especially if they’re more active, like runners,” she said. “A lot of patients say they have to double up on sports bras or that they can’t find a bra that fits.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; “I saved for an entire year to do this … I knew [it] was going to make me feel better and give me the confidence I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jennie Rodriquez&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Jennie’s journey&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a total hysterectomy sent Rodriquez into menopause at just 38, she immediately noticed a change in her weight distribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For basically my whole life, I’ve been a smaller person,” she said. After having children, Rodriquez noted that she gained some weight, but a GLP-1 medication helped her shed 50 pounds in three months. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I got down to what was the perfect size for me,” she said. “Then I got the hysterectomy, and I gained all the weight back and couldn’t lose it again on my own. Even when I went back to the medication, it didn’t work like it had before.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham offers cosmetic surgeries and noninvasive treatments, like Botox. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Rodriquez found herself out of breath doing normal activities, like going for a walk, and struggled to fit into her clothes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She was especially self-conscious about her stomach and knew she wanted a tummy tuck with liposuction to address her concerns — two procedures that Ramanadham said are staples of the menopause makeover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To afford the procedure, Rodriquez had to take on a second job. “I saved for an entire year to do this,” she said. “But it was something that I knew was going to make me feel better and give me the confidence I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex"&gt;

&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jennie Rodriquez before a tummy tuck and liposuction. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Jennie Rodriquez after undergoing the procedures. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reversing wrinkles,  under-eye bags,  saggy necks and droopy noses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Menopause can also wreak havoc on your skin. “Collagen declines in our early 20s and 30s, but there’s more of that rapid decline in the perimenopausal period,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies show women can lose up to 30% of collagen in the first five years after menopause, causing a loss of skin elasticity and firmness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We also lose water concentration, so our skin gets very dry as well,” Ramanadham noted. These changes often result in fine lines, wrinkles and sagging skin, particularly around the eyes and neck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the nose that wasn’t droopy before becomes droopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the eyes, a significant drop in estrogen during menopause weakens the muscles on the upper lids, creating a hooded effect that can make you look tired and older. The withdrawal of estrogen also causes eye puffiness, where fat under the eyes moves forward, forming bags.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham said surgical options like upper and lower eyelid lifts and brow lifts are common. For those wanting a less invasive approach, dermal fillers, Botox and platelet-rich plasma injections can promote collagen production, helping with under-eye bags, wrinkles and dark circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the neck, a neck lift is the go-to solution for correcting sagging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We remove the excess skin, address some of the underlying changes that happen, like with the muscles, and reposition the soft tissue and remaining skin,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those wanting to avoid going under the knife, Botox, microneedling and radio frequency skin tightening can also help. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“None of these nonsurgical options are going to address the actual changes that occur structurally, but they can help soften the appearance,” Ramanadham said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The drop in estrogen can even cause noticeable sagging in the soft tissues of the nose.  “Suddenly, the nose that wasn’t droopy before becomes droopy,” Ramanadham said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of stigma around plastic surgery. Now I think we view it more as a part of overall wellness and improving our self-confidence.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Smita Ramanadham&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this, a traditional rhinoplasty, or nose job, can correct the sagging snout. But if you want to avoid surgery, a liquid rhinoplasty using dermal fillers can smooth out bumps, add volume or correct asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When to consider surgical solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The menopause transition typically lasts around seven years. While it’s a personal choice when to pursue cosmetic procedures, Ramanadham advises patients to wait until the changes in their body have stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“For example, if you’ve gained weight and you’re actively trying to lose it, we don’t want to operate on a moving target,” she said. “I always tell my patients to get to a stable, happy baseline weight that they can maintain long term first.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, if you’re unhappy with your appearance, starting a conversation with a board-certified plastic surgeon is a good place to begin. “They can tell you if you’re a good candidate and if surgery can provide the goals that you’re looking for.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Shifting perceptions &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every woman goes through “the change” — so why is the menopause makeover trending today?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ramanadham believes social media has played a large role in raising awareness about the cosmetic options available and reducing the stigma around them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In the past, there was still a lot of stigma around plastic surgery,” she said. “Now I think we view it more as a part of overall wellness and improving our self-confidence.” &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People are also living longer and want their outward appearance to reflect the youthful energy they feel on the inside. Ramanadham has patients in their 70s who, despite initial doubts, find that age isn’t necessarily a barrier to surgery.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“We of course make sure all of your doctors are on board and you’re safe for surgery, but if you’re active and this will make you a better version of yourself, then let’s do it,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Rodriquez, now 43, the decision to get cosmetic surgery was a personal one that she has no regrets about — even if it took two or three weeks post-op before she could climb the stairs to her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We only have one life, and you should enjoy it to the fullest, ” she said. “Whether it’s something as major as surgery or as simple as Botox, anything that helps you feel better about yourself and stand a little taller at the end of the day is all that really matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
