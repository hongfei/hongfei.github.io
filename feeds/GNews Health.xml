Without hesitation, Sayer, who frequently fosters Frenchie pups, agreed to take them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;The puppies, named Violet and Dash, were both just 1 day old and so small that they could fit in the palm of Sayer’s hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="2"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;“[T]hey were tiny,” Sayer told The Dodo. “They were 5 and 6 ounces. The size of a mouse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;Violet, the female puppy, was born with a cleft lip and a partial cleft palate, while Dash, the male puppy, had a cleft lip and complete cleft palate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;For the past few years, Sayer has been specializing in fostering dogs with cleft lips and palates. As a vet tech, she has experience working with puppies who need a little extra care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="3"&gt;It’s also a topic she has a personal connection to, as her son, Landon, has a cleft palate. Sayer was delighted to find that Landon loved helping take care of her foster dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="ConnatixVideostyles__ConnatixVideoWrap-sc-woid5f-0 ktIfME connatix-article-mobile"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="5"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;“He was so gentle, and the animals were just naturally gravitating to him,” Sayer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;Because Landon shares an experience in common with the pups he helps raise, he and the dogs understand each other on a deep level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="2"&gt;“I love helping them,” Landon told The Dodo. “It feels so good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="3"&gt;For the first few weeks Violet and Dash were with Sayer and Landon, they needed around-the-clock care. Newborn puppies are always a handful, and because Violet and Dash needed some help getting used to eating, Sayer was up with them every hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="7"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;Sayer, as a fierce advocate for cleft palate dogs, was more than happy to help. All she wanted was to give the pups a fighting chance, since many dogs born with cleft palates end up getting abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;While Sayer will always be there for the dogs who need her help, she can’t help but speak out against the breeding practices that are making cleft palate puppies increasingly common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="9"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;“In the Frenchie space, we’re seeing, unfortunately, a lot of people breeding for these rare colors and these rare things,” Sayer said. “We’ve changed the breed so much over the years and made it so that they can’t breathe, they have spinal issues, they have all these problems that … it’s hard to see that being ethical in any way, shape or form.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="1"&gt;Thankfully, though, Violet and Dash are thriving. They’re almost 3 months old now and have gone from tiny “potatoes” to rambunctious, energetic puppies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ParagraphBodyTextstyles__BodyText-sc-zv221u-0 eJmGWQ page-element paragraph undefined " data-element-type="ParagraphBodyText" data-element-index="11"&gt;&lt;p data-element-index="0"&gt;Once they’re a little older and more independent, they’ll be available for adoption.

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of kids dream of one day being firefighters, astronauts, doctors, or pro athletes. Top White House health adviser Calley Means, it seems, had a different dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From as long as I could remember, I was going to change public policy in the United States,” Means said in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhZDZc47OuM"&gt;2023 video interview&lt;/a&gt; with the conservative media organization PragerU. “That was my obsession growing up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obsession has become a reality as Means, 39, has gone from being a frequent podcast guest urging a shakeup of the country’s health and nutrition systems to being one of the most powerful and influential health policymakers in the federal government. As a key figure in the Make America Healthy Again movement, he’s part of a vanguard of outsider activists challenging the Washington health establishment. (That movement also includes his sister Casey, a Stanford-educated doctor who quit her residency after becoming disillusioned with the mainstream medical system. She’s now &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-surgeon-general-laura-loomer-794da62da02d5699683e3b1540b8a31f"&gt;the nominee for U.S. surgeon general&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like so many of those empowered by Donald Trump to disrupt the expert class, Means comes from the same world of those he’s looking to supplant: elite universities, a stint in Washington on his résume, and a presumption that the tools of government can solve problems if only placed in the right hands. And right now, incredibly, the health care tools have been placed in Means’ hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps none of this should be a surprise. Means grew up in Washington, the son of a former Nixon and Ford administration aide who later became an executive in the consulting business. After graduating from Stanford and beginning his career working in public affairs consulting—more on that in a bit—the younger Means attended Harvard Business School, graduating with an MBA in 2015. For a few years, Means worked in the Bay Area for a software company before launching a start-up with his wife that sold customized wedding dresses. They &lt;a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/davids-bridal-acquires-custom-wedding-dress-startup-anomalie/623973/"&gt;sold the startup to David’s Bridal in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Means family suffered tragedy in 2021 when their mother, Gayle, died soon after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In Calley Means’ telling, her death was a moment that “&lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1790540500031971585?lang=en"&gt;put all the pieces together&lt;/a&gt;” for him about the country’s overarching health crisis. In short: The medical, pharmaceutical, and food industries are all incentivized by government and market forces to keep Americans sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are being lied to that cancer is random, that dementia is random, that kidney disease is random, that all these issues that are killing us are random. They’re not,” Means said in that PragerU video. “They’re all exploding, and they’re all tied, essentially, to food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting from this dubious and reductive premise,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the two siblings embarked on a media- and business-based partnership advancing their belief in alternative medicine. Since quitting her residency, Casey Means opened her own nontraditional medical practice focused on “functional medicine.” (Her medical license in Oregon, where she did her residency, is &lt;a href="https://omb.oregon.gov/Clients/ORMB/Public/VerificationDetails.aspx?EntityID=1530903"&gt;currently inactive&lt;/a&gt; and expires at the end of this year.)  Calley, meanwhile, started his own company, TrueMed, that aims to help customers pay for everything from gym memberships to “wellness” products like supplements with pre-tax funds from health savings accounts and flexible savings accounts. They wrote a bestselling book together, &lt;em&gt;Good Energy&lt;/em&gt;, that purports to identify the root cause of practically every disease and health condition: bad metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair became frequent guests on television, podcasts, and (most importantly) on Tucker Carlson’s post-Fox News online talk show, offering both personal stories of their encounters with America’s supposedly misguided medical and nutritional establishment and an enticing pitch that the fix for the country’s health problems is a “simple” change in leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To establish his authority on the subject, Means is often introduced as a former D.C.-based lobbyist for some of the companies and industries that benefit from the status quo. (He himself is more careful, usually more accurately referring to himself as working in public affairs.) Much like his sister becoming jaded by the practices of mainstream medicine, Means tells a story about coming to grips with the ugliness of &lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1744541823450968461"&gt;manipulating studies&lt;/a&gt; to craft public relations campaigns for the pharmaceutical and beverage industry groups. The subtext of his current activist and policymaking phase is that Means is seeking redemption for all the wrongs he committed during his K Street years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But others who knew Means from this time in his life—when he worked first at the firm Mercury and later the PR giant Edelman—say he was a relatively junior staffer, working on accounts for the American Beverage Association or Bayer but hardly a decisionmaker on strategy. (Those who knew him then requested anonymity in no small part thanks to Means’ penchant for &lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1611053771848847361"&gt;publicly&lt;/a&gt; accusing his critics and opponents of &lt;a href="https://x.com/calleymeans/status/1882810044619616707"&gt;being paid off&lt;/a&gt; by corporate interests.) And for whatever misgivings Means has about his time working for these clients, it hasn’t stopped him from &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/calley-means-a29b5512/"&gt;boasting on his LinkedIn page&lt;/a&gt; that the accounts he worked on “often ran at 40%+ profit margin and highest client satisfaction.” The White House did not return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of those details, Means tells a good story for podcast audiences looking for confirmation that the powerful are inherently corrupt. In his appearances, Means seems to have answers for questions on issues as divergent as how we treat dementia (poorly) to the approval of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic (he’s against them). Means’ overarching heuristic? If it’s the accepted consensus of the experts, it’s been influenced by bad motives and it’s probably wrong. “We need to break free from the incentives of a medical and food system that is highly incentivized for us to be addicted to cheap and dangerous food, and sicker for longer periods of time,” he said in the PragerU video. “We need to listen to ourselves, do our own research, and not listen to the experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzRjkNYT-U8"&gt;February 2024&lt;/a&gt; appearance with Carlson, Means caught the attention of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The two met soon after at an event for Kennedy’s presidential campaign in Austin. Means would later reveal on another podcast—&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0lTyhvOeJs"&gt;Joe Rogan’s, of course&lt;/a&gt;—of what transpired in the portable sauna where he and Kennedy sat and talked. “Actually, it sounds very woo-woo, but I was in a sweat tent with him in Austin at a campaign event,” Means said. “I just had this strong vision of him standing with Trump and how what RFK represents is actually what Trump represents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Means became close with Kennedy, advising him on his campaign and later brokering the meeting between him and Trump that led to the Democrat-turned-independent dropping out of the race and endorsing the Republican nominee. Means was suddenly a major political player, helping forge an alliance between MAGA and MAHA that may have helped deliver the White House to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Means officially joined the administration as a White House health adviser in March, and it’s clear his viewpoint holds a lot of sway in Trump’s Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUH4Co2wE-I"&gt;another episode&lt;/a&gt; of Carlson’s online show last year, the former Fox News host asked Means what he would do if he were president. “Day one: state of emergency for childhood chronic disease,” Means said. “What’s happening in childhood chronic disease is a much-orders-of-magnitude bigger state of emergency right now and more imminent emergency in America than COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn’t happen on day one exactly, but it sounds awfully similar to what President Trump established through &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/"&gt;an executive order in February&lt;/a&gt;: a commission, headed by Kennedy, charged with “investigating and addressing the root causes of America’s escalating health crisis, with an initial focus on childhood chronic diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Means didn’t just inspire the commission; by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/rfk-jr-pesticides-agriculture-d23ae280?mod=hp_lead_pos1"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/well/calley-means-maha.html"&gt;accounts&lt;/a&gt;, he was deeply involved in its recently released, 72-page &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assessment.pdf"&gt;“Make Our Children Healthy Again”&lt;/a&gt; assessment. The report lays out a case for what is causing chronic diseases in children, targeting everything from processed foods and pesticides to overmedication and overexposure to screens. (But as &lt;a href="https://www.notus.org/health-science/make-america-healthy-again-report-citation-errors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NOTUS&lt;/em&gt; reported this week&lt;/a&gt;, the report has some issues, including the fact that several of the academic studies cited in footnotes don’t seem to, erm, exist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the throughline of the report is also a throughline in Means’ own thinking: America’s health is being held hostage by the profit motive of the pharmaceutical and food and beverage industries, which not only lobby the federal government to protect their interests but infiltrate the institutions of society to reinforce their market position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s not get conspiratorial,” Means said during an appearance last year on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pniS7YmoJk"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Skinny Confidential &lt;/em&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “Let’s just be very specific: The food industry wants our food to be addictive and cheap, and the health care industry, just as a statement of economic fact, they want people to be sicker for longer periods of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Means has quickly ascended by performing as an insider uncovering the sinister motivations of his one-time peers, he also tries to work the system to his benefit.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It was just last year that Means was &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2024/06/27/wellness-execs-pitch-their-industry-to-address-chronic-disease-00165440"&gt;heading up&lt;/a&gt; his own united coalition called End Chronic Disease that included the leaders of companies like exercise brand CrossFit and health supplement company AG1. This lobbying effort aimed to push back on &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-alert-beware-of-companies-misrepresenting-nutrition-wellness-and-general-health-expenses-as-medical-care-for-fsas-hsas-hras-and-msas"&gt;the IRS crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on people using their pre-tax health care dollars to buy these products, a direct threat to Means’ company TrueMed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, one of his company’s competitors in the wellness space has &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/calley-means-wellness-ethics-complaint-hhs-00342230"&gt;filed an ethics complaint against Means&lt;/a&gt;. The complaint alleges that Means has used his position in the Trump administration to threaten the CEO of the Wellness Company, Peter Gillooly, after he accused Gillooly of leaking false information about TrueMed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If one more thing happens, I’m going to go to [National Institutes of Health director] Jay Bhattacharya and Bobby [Kennedy] and tell him that you and your cadre … are spreading lies and trying to f— with him and hurt his administration,” Means said in a phone call with Gillooly, who says Means’ actions represent a conflict of interest. Means has pushed back, telling &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; he was merely threatening legal action against someone he believed to be spreading false information about his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lobbying for special favors, vague lawsuit threats, a fight spilling out in Washington’s premier trade publication—there’s no doubt that Means remains an insider, through and through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

Symptoms may include an itchy rash, fever, headache, joint pain, and pink eye. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock image of the Aedes mosquito, which carries Zika virus.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Hawaii's first case of Zika was travel-related — meaning, it was not acquired on the island — the HDOH said in a &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/newsroom/doh-investigating-travel-related-zika-case-on-o%CA%BBahu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:May 27 statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;May 27 statement&lt;/a&gt;, where it asked for help in controlling the mosquito population and reducing the risk of bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zika is especially dangerous for pregnant women because it can be transmitted to the fetus, causing microcephaly (a smaller head), improper brain development, and cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also risk of the fetus developing a condition called Congenital Zika Syndrome, which is a combination of severe conditions including a collapsed skull, severe microcephaly, a reduction in brain tissue, as well as problems with eyes, joints, and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawaiians and visitors are urged to use insect repellent — specifically, “products registered with the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents/find-repellent-right-you" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Environmental Protection Agency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; that contain 20–30% DEET” or picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus and IR3535.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Property owners are urged to make sure screens are intact, doors are left closed and to remove standing water that may encourage mosquitoes to breed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andre Seale/VW PICS/Universal Images Group via Getty&lt;/p&gt;

species of mosquitos that carry the Zika virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HDOH said they’ve dispatched "vector control teams" to the areas of most concern, which include including Waialua and the popular surfer destination of Haleʻiwa on the North Shore of Oʻahu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The island is home to nearly 1 million residents, and is the location of popular destinations like &lt;a href="https://people.com/2-killed-after-plane-crashes-into-building-near-honolulu-airport-during-training-flight-8763667" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Honolulu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Honolulu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://people.com/hawaii-imposes-the-nation-first-climate-change-tax-for-tourists-11745042" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Waikiki;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Waikiki&lt;/a&gt;

General Hospital, said: 'Lots of reports have shown that there have been fewer heart attacks in hospitals since 2020 — but something seems to be missing from that data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We now show that if you account for deaths at home, cardiac deaths are going up and have stayed up for years. Today there are a lot more people having cardiac deaths at home, which also raises the concern that people with heart disease haven’t been getting the care they need since the pandemic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Covid virus — which is thought to have infected over 100million Americans — has been shown to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-9944435/COVID-drove-43-spike-heart-inflammation-cases-hospitals-2020.html"&gt;cause damage to the heart and blood vessels which may be a factor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors say more factors must be at play, which are still being understood — including diet and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, a study this week found&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761339/heart-attack-risk-linked-cannabis.html"&gt; smoking marijuana&lt;/a&gt; or consuming edibles may raise the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mass General Brigham researchers found in a new study that heart attack deaths exceeded expectations during the pandemic (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the estimated deaths from cardiac causes in Massachusetts residents compared to the actual rate. The researchers said many of these deaths occurred at home&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the full findings have not yet been released, the experts believe the pandemic could also be linked to a mystery rise in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13920613/Alarming-rise-super-fit-slim-young-people-suffering-heart-attacks-experts-reveal-theories-surge.html"&gt;young Americans suffering heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Friday in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.12919"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 127,746 death certificates from people who died in Massachusetts between January 2014 and July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age was 77 and about 52 percent were men.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then made population estimates based on US Census data from 2014 to 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using death certificate and census data, the team set an expected cardiac death rate for 2020 to 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found cardiac deaths were 16 percent higher than expected in 2020, 17 percent higher in 2021 and 2022 and six percent higher in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amount of monthly cardiac deaths at home also exceeded expected levels between 2020 and 2022 and in hospitals between 2020 and 2023.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they cited additional data showing heart attack hospitalizations decreased by 20 to 34 percent after the start of the pandemic. This suggests many of these excess deaths occurred at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'In this population-based cohort study of Massachusetts decedents, we found cardiac deaths increased substantially starting in 2020, with exaggerated seasonal patterns and increases in deaths at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While numerous other studies have found fewer admissions for cardiac emergencies in countries across the world, these studies may have missed events occurring outside of hospitals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers suggested this increase could be due to more people avoiding hospitals during the pandemic or being dismissed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;CDC &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6936a4.htm"&gt;research from 2020&lt;/a&gt;, for example, found 40 percent of Americans delayed or avoided seeking medical care at the start of the pandemic, and 12 percent stayed away from emergency rooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, emerging research also shows the Covid virus itself may cause long-term heart issues, increasing the risk of cardiac deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attack cases are on the rise in young Americans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chloe Burke went into cardiac arrest at 21 years old while cheering at the University of Houston. She is now educating others about cardiac arrest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid has been linked to myocarditis, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14329779/covid-vaccine-research-heart-effects-new-study.html"&gt;inflammation of the heart muscle&lt;/a&gt;, and pericarditis, inflammation of the sac-like lining surrounding the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With myocarditis, it's thought that Covid causes the immune system to attack itself and cause inflammation of the myocardium, the heart's muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This same mechanism has been linked to pericarditis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While most cases are mild, in rare instances, myocarditis can damage the heart and make it difficult for it to pump blood, eventually leading to heart failure, heart attack, and stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases as rare as one in 200,000, the mRNA in Covid vaccines may trigger a similar immune response and cause myocarditis or pericarditis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid-induced inflammation also alters the heart's electrical signals, leading to irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research released this week also pointed to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14761339/heart-attack-risk-linked-cannabis.html"&gt;smoking weed or taking edibles&lt;/a&gt; at least three times a week as a potential cause of heart attacks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That team found endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels and regulate blood flow, released less nitric oxide in people who regularly smoked marijuana or took edibles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Matias Escobar nearly died while competing in the New York City Triathlon.

Our findings suggest that both patient choices about seeking care and outcomes after experiencing a cardiac emergency also have changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Had we not examined mortality using death certificate data, the increases in population cardiac mortality could have gone unnoticed.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including the lack of data on the causes leading to cardiac death. It's unclear when the full findings will be released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was partially funded by the National Institutes of Health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

By bridging genetics, neuroscience, and psychiatry, their work has illuminated how variations in DNA and environmental influences shape brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using models from fruit flies to stem cells and leveraging data science, they aim to develop more precise and personalized mental health treatments. Their recent focus on epigenetics explores how life experiences can modify gene activity, offering new paths for early detection and prevention in psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Foundations:&lt;/strong&gt; DNA variations play a key role in shaping brain function and behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Epigenetic research reveals how life experiences can alter gene expression and influence mental health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next-Gen Psychiatry:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrating molecular tools and data science opens doors to personalized treatment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a comprehensive Genomic Press interview published today, Professor Barbara Franke unveils her remarkable scientific journey from an inquisitive child fascinated by nature to becoming one of the world’s most influential researchers in biological psychiatry. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecular psychiatrist at Radboud University has fundamentally transformed our understanding of how genetic variations lead to altered behavior in neurodevelopmental conditions, particularly ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From HeLa Cells to Human Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Franke’s career trajectory took an unexpected turn during a practical session isolating DNA from HeLa cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I fell in love with molecular genetics,” she recalls, describing how this pivotal moment shifted her focus from studying great apes in Africa to unraveling the molecular mysteries of human behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This transition ultimately led her to psychiatric genetics, where she found her true calling in addressing the controversial and misunderstood nature of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 500 peer-reviewed publications, Professor Franke has established herself among the top 1% most cited scientists globally. Her work extends far beyond traditional gene identification, employing innovative approaches that bridge multiple scientific disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am absolutely amazed at how much we can already learn about the biological pathways and brain-cellular substrates underlying psychiatric conditions using data science methods,” she notes, while emphasizing the indispensable role of experimental validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Bridges Across Disciplines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Franke’s leadership in founding multiple international research consortia, including the International Multicentre persistent ADHD Collaboration (IMpACT) and the ECNP Network ADHD across the lifespan, demonstrates her commitment to collaborative science. As a founding member of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC), she recognized early that advancing psychiatric genetics required unprecedented international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her research philosophy combines cutting-edge bioinformatics with experimental models ranging from fruit flies to human induced pluripotent stem cells. This multifaceted approach raises intriguing questions about how genetic variations translate into behavioral differences and whether understanding these mechanisms could lead to more personalized treatments for neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Vision for Psychiatric Classification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently heading the Medical Neuroscience department at Radboud University Medical Center, Professor Franke harbors ambitious goals. “We still need a new nosology in psychiatry, and I want to contribute to that by identifying genes and pathways,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her recent venture into epigenetics research explores how environmental factors interact with genetic predispositions, potentially unlocking new avenues for prevention and intervention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decorated Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion approaches her work with a philosophy captured by the German proverb she lives by: “Die Suppe wird nicht so heiß gegessen, wie sie gekocht wird” (“The soup is not eaten as hot as it is cooked”). This balanced perspective has enabled her to navigate complex scientific challenges while mentoring the next generation of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact Beyond the Laboratory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Franke’s influence extends beyond her scientific contributions. Her “jump first, think later” mentorship approach has empowered countless young scientists, particularly women, to seize opportunities in competitive research environments. This philosophy raises important questions about how scientific culture might evolve if more researchers embraced calculated risk-taking and rapid decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interview reveals fascinating insights into Professor Franke’s recent move to epigenetics, using advanced single-cell resolution techniques to study DNA modifications and transcriptomes. These cutting-edge approaches could potentially identify biomarkers for treatment response or reveal critical windows for intervention during brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As psychiatric conditions continue to affect millions worldwide, Professor Franke’s work offers hope for improved diagnosis and treatment. Her integration of molecular biology, neuroscience, and clinical psychiatry exemplifies the interdisciplinary approach needed to tackle complex brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question remains: How quickly can these biological insights translate into tangible improvements in patient care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and ADHD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6805090401461f07060f280f0d060705010b181a0d1b1b460b0705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ma-Li Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Press&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ma-Li Wong – Genomic Press&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.61373/gp025k.0053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Understanding the biological pathways from genes to altered behaviour in neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD – paving the way for improved understanding and care in psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;” by Barbara Franke et al. &lt;em&gt;Genomic Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding the biological pathways from genes to altered behaviour in neurodevelopmental conditions like ADHD – paving the way for improved understanding and care in psychiatry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this Genomic Press Interview, Professor Barbara Franke, a trailblazing molecular psychiatrist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, shares her extraordinary scientific journey from an inquisitive child fascinated by nature to becoming one of the world’s most influential researchers in biological psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over 500 peer-reviewed publications and recognition among the top 1% most cited scientists globally, Franke has helped to revolutionize our understanding of the genetic foundations of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing together international experts for interdisciplinary research, she founded and leads multiple international research consortia, including the International Multicentre persistent ADHD Collaboration (IMpACT) and the ECNP Network ADHD across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her pioneering work extends beyond gene identification to illuminating the biological pathways from genetic variations to altered behaviour, employing innovative complementary approaches including bioinformatics, brain imaging genetics, and experimental models using fruit flies and human induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An elected member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, decorated Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion, and recipient of numerous prestigious awards, Franke’s scientific contributions are matched by her passionate commitment to international collaboration and mentorship of the next generation of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her recent move into epigenetics research, investigating the interplay between heritable and environmental influences on psychiatric conditions, illustrates her unwavering determination to contribute to a new nosology in psychiatry that will ultimately improve diagnosis, treatment, and management for millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guided by the German proverb “Die Suppe wird nicht so heiß gegessen, wie sie gekocht wird” (“The soup is not eaten as hot as it is cooked”), Franke’s balanced approach to life and science continues to inspire groundbreaking advances at the intersection of genetics, neuroscience, and psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers highlight how maternal stress, caregiving quality, and early environmental cues influence the development of brain systems that regulate emotion and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These early-life signals may prepare children for future adversity, but if the environment shifts, that preparation can backfire, leading to anxiety in adolescence. As social and technological landscapes change rapidly, the mismatch between early expectations and lived experiences may be amplifying mental health struggles among youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Prenatal stress and caregiving quality shape brain systems tied to emotional regulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Mismatch:&lt;/strong&gt; Early-life cues may prime children for danger, causing anxiety if threats don’t materialize.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Lifespan-focused, preventative mental health strategies must start in early childhood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a Perspective, Mark Hanson and Peter Gluckman explore how maternal stress, caregiving quality, and early environmental conditions can shape the development of executive functions and emotional regulation in children, and how these factors contribute to the emergence of anxiety disorders in young people. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounting evidence reveals a significant rise in anxiety disorders among adolescents ages 12 to 19, especially in developing countries like the United States, which cannot be fully explained by contemporary stressful events like the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern suggests that broader longer-term societal or developmental factors are driving the growing prevalence of adolescent anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Hanson and Gluckman highlight how environmental conditions in the earliest stages of life – beginning even before birth – can significantly shape a child’s developing brain, particularly the systems responsible for emotional regulation and executive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, these early cues may “prepare” children for adversity, but if the anticipated threats never fully materialize as they grow, such heightened emotional responses may lead to anxiety disorders, especially in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mismatch is further compounded by the rapid and dynamic social and technological changes young people now face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Societies face an emerging burden of mental health issues, especially in young people. Although appropriate interventions are needed to help those already affected, preventative approaches are also critical,” write Hanson and Gluckman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Solutions will need to adopt a lifecourse perspective, involving more cohesive thinking about parental and caregiver support and the early childhood years by policymakers across health, education, and social welfare.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and anxiety research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ed9e8e849d8c86ad8c8c8c9ec3829f8a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Press Package Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aaas.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Science Press Package Team – AAAS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp3764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Growing anxious–Are preschoolers matched to their futures?&lt;/a&gt;” by Mark A.

For example, over- or inappropriate expression of anxiety later in human life can turn out to be maladaptive, reducing an individual’s own or social functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps anxiety disorders can be understood as inappropriate socioemotional regulation in relation to actual, perceived, or anticipated challenges.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:32:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE85MktnS25iTTdpWmJ6akpodVEyZGNQaTl5RjE1MXdpZjRvQldEN2pQd3loZURQU3ZGRUFzemFKa3o4STZWSHpLUXd4bkQ1SGk1cENnTmZKaWpmUXRfV285eG9Sdl9NLWVpSTUxZ1NXNmZzMGpqUEVMT3dZNA</guid></item><item><title>我在减肥刺拳中失去了五块石头......但是当你停下来时会发生什么，这是一个令人震惊的事实-每日邮报 | I lost five stone on a weight loss jab...but there's an alarming truth about what happens when you stop - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOQXhveDJ2VmREVTNmVnhobE5HdkJ1dW1IRG9vWUt4ZGNxMHBLWF9JTUxDTzA4N19CZ0NCX0FraEVkU25QNmxZeGJzWjAtTWZNUDJ6em5abmdjajlIVG9jRTNJeTV4c0d6Tnhmamtiem5oSlpsR2NiODFsSU1TVWtlTUNCajYwSmlLUGhLb3RiYVhMM05hZHRvbjVn0gGfAUFVX3lxTE1pSXZxTThmRXBZR1psMmZreTJkV214ZUVuXzFxc0lJaFJRLWNhSFQ0ZmFvRzVXdDdXTHVjdEZxTlZVSk5iSWZEMTdzM0NZd3VBeVNqS3VMYWdHUjJDREVFTnJPb3BDczZZLUdpNUhndE9PSWR6UnpDd3dTeFpyUC1tNGgzcHNfLTVNZ1loNk1iU2xVZzBmaVUtODZMZWtHWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man who shed five stone in a year thanks to a skinny jab has told of how he fears he will have to be on the drug for life—after he regained half the weight in months when he tried to stop the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;John Kane, 76, from Dublin, weighed nearly 19 stone and plummeted to under 14 within a year of taking liraglutide in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liraglutide works in a similar way to semaglutide—the generic name for Ozempic—triggering the release of the hormone GLP-1 that makes us feel full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jabs, which he obtained privately, initially vastly improved Mr Kane's life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication helped get his type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-0bc3b200-3d5e-11f0-bd6f-35f6b9903e9d"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; into remission, and enjoy active social excursions that he couldn't before, including hikes in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/spain/index.html" id="mol-b6a42a30-3d52-11f0-8363-ade3523f848d" class=""&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the success, he decided to stop the injections in 2018 due to the eye-watering&lt;span&gt; £232 a month cost. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Speaking to the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.independent.ie/life/health-wellbeing/health-features/life-after-ozempic-half-the-weight-id-lost-i-put-back-on-over-six-months/a1602857534.html"&gt;Irish Independent&lt;/a&gt;, he said his raging appetite returned with a vengeance almost immediately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had really put a lot of effort into the last two years, and was determined not to put back on the weight,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Kane, 76, from Dublin, weighed nearly 19 stone and plummeted to under 14 within a year of taking liraglutide, a drug much like Ozempic—but says he gained half of it back in six months when he came off the jab&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'But whether I liked it or not, even watching my food, the weight just started to creep back up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within six months, Mr Kane had regained half the weight he'd lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The major setback caused him to 'hit the rocks, mentally'. '&lt;span&gt;It was really affecting me,' he said. 'I’m not one to be depressed, but it really bit into me.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six months without the medicine, Mr Kane's wife suggested he 'bite the bullet' and pay for more injections, to stop the decline of his health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When semaglitude, better known as Ozempic, was rolled out at a cheaper cost of £118, it became a more affordable option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; He has now been on taking the medication for nearly eight years—a maintenance dose of 1mg a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has no plans to stop again and said if he were to ever come off he'd become a 'very sad, dejected, depressed person.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss drugs like Ozempic have burst onto the scene in recent years, hailed as a potential fix for the UK's spiraling obesity crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Semaglutide mimics glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a naturally occurring hormone released in the small intestine when you eat. It tells your brain you're full and slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After years of rigorous scientific trials, semaglutide has been chemically modified to last far longer than the body’s own, short-lived supply of GLP-1. As a result, it keeps people feeling fuller for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US researchers at Cornell University in New York found those on the injections typically lost &lt;span&gt;lost around 13.7 per cent of their body weight, on average, over a 72-week period. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But a study in the journal Epic Research found that 44 per cent of people who lost at least five pounds using semaglutide and then stopped the drug regained at least 25 per cent of their lost weight within a year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Emma Cunningham, an aesthetics expert who treats patients suffering cosmetic complications of Ozempic, said some choose to go on a maintenance dose and wean off the drug that way.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can’t be solely reliant on the drug,' she said. 'You need to be using this as an opportunity to address your lifestyle.

"In fact, they are prescribed the other way around with lifestyle therapy being the adjunct if being thought about at all. Doctors are not following either society guidelines or FDA guidelines if they are prescribing [GLP-1s] without lifestyle therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Before starting GLP-1 medications, the report recommended that patients work with their doctors to set goals that focus on overall health, not just weight loss. It's also important to check for any stomach or bone issues that could lead to side effects like nausea, vomiting, or muscle and bone loss, the report stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Registered dietitians can play really key roles in comprehensive obesity care by providing medical nutrition therapy to support GLP-1 therapy," said Emily A. Callahan, registered dietitian nutritionist and director of policy strategy for the Food is Medicine Institute. "The evidence space is growing that shows when registered dietitians deliver medical nutrition therapy, it has been associated with improvements in body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and glycemic control."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;People should usually start GLP-1 medications at the lowest dose and slowly increase as needed, the report said. Patients should also be aware that nausea is common when taking these drugs and this may trigger cravings for sugary, high-calorie comfort foods that work against weight loss. To stay on track, the report recommended eating small, frequent meals and focusing on minimally processed, nutrient-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report called for exercising special caution for anyone following an intermittent fasting diet or a low-carbohydrate "keto diet" that limits foods like breads, pastas and fruit to put the body into a state called ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbs. These individuals might be especially vulnerable to gastrointestinal side effects, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also advised people who may not be getting enough nutrients to consider taking supplements like vitamin D, calcium and multivitamins, while increasing protein intake by 50-100% from foods such as fish, eggs, nuts and seeds. This is especially important for those eating less while on GLP-1s, since lower food intake can make it harder to get all the nutrients the body needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The report also underscored the importance of maintaining muscle mass and bone density while losing weight. Since weight loss can also lead to muscle loss -- especially in older adults -- the report advised doing a full body strength training routine at least three times a week and getting 150 minutes of moderate cardio each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Focusing on nutrition, physical activity and other healthy lifestyle habits should give GLP-1 users a greater chance of achieving their goals, the report concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"GLP-1s have the best chance of helping people achieve and sustain lasting weight reduction when they are paired with strong nutrition guidance and lifestyle support," said Callahan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Dr. Brendan Huang serves as the chief resident physician in adult neurology at Northwell Health and is also a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 14:19:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxOR3lrX3ItNTNqVmpLYjE5ekNWaFB0eFF2dVh5MmFoaE9Pc0FMbGNlNVFqSDVnZVZPSVNCSGU4cUF0cVJtb0ZReFdndmZhSVlZUm53U3JpMjdvRnA3RlNocmhJS3dzdmp5WFJ4bUJmS3hxdkg2WkRXMGV4NDhlWUEzbHQ5VEJtOWxqdGNHSTNMN2ZSNzdJajJzUXpZVnZ5RUNuZmg3NXBR0gGrAUFVX3lxTE1BMERONFBDV0tMU0piVmZOSUptbXdHQ3cxZUZsQ0trdzAzWEZRX0NSQ0xfVTRwQTZEWnd2dUVUZTJJd0s4SS1oZmY2M01GZ2tyak9JWnlJWDJ0Z2E0ZjF6QnRHaHVsM0dLLTRUbXJVWDZUdGd6Q0xKMFlqUmhfWkZVQ2x1UGx0YlNFTDBqTkU4Y3BQMlRvbzZMNzBMa2dhRXJRRzUtNGltR2N5TQ</guid></item><item><title>这只猫粪便寄生虫可以斩首精子-它可能会加剧不孕症- Gizmodo | This Cat Poop Parasite Can Decapitate Sperm—and It Might Be Fueling Infertility - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQNHVLVVYwTWo5TkE5REYtX1FPU0l4QmJRak5wZFhEZndhNmVYZXNtQU5uRTBMQlhDb2dFOVA1SGtTNzB1MFhVYTNUaVVnVC12dUlQblh2VFhTNW5qQXJHM2tvWnhMbmJyWS1wTWwxUm9LQTFvVTN4U3dQVWNNc3lyN1o2bnNZbmxUSHZQS29XU3NFUGowcXUxbE92dmE3R29NSjRnM1ktZnlienFuYnNv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Male fertility rates have been plummeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmac035"&gt;over the past half-century&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis from 1992 noted a steady decrease in sperm counts and quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;since the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent study found that male infertility rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;increased nearly 80% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons driving this trend remain a mystery, but frequently cited culprits include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000745"&gt;obesity, poor diet, and environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fertility-academy.co.uk/blog/7-stis-that-affect-male-fertility/"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as gonorrhea or chlamydia are often overlooked factors that affect fertility in men. Accumulating evidence suggests that a common single-celled parasite called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may also be a contributor: An April 2025 study showed for the first time that “human sperm &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;lose their heads&lt;/a&gt; upon direct contact” with the parasite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am a microbiologist, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william"&gt;my lab studies &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new study bolsters emerging findings that underscore the importance of preventing this parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infected cats defecate &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; eggs into the litter box, garden or other places in the environment where they can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/ahr2005100"&gt;picked up by humans or other animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11162542"&gt;Water, shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can also harbor infectious parasite eggs. In addition to eggs, tissue cysts present in the meat of warm-blooded animals can spread toxoplasmosis as well if they are not destroyed by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/toxoplasma-food-safety-moms-be"&gt;cooking to proper temperature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While most hosts of the parasite can control the initial infection with few if any symptoms, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; remains in the body for life as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00305.x"&gt;dormant cysts in brain, heart and muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These cysts can reactivate and cause additional episodes of severe illness that damage critical organ systems. Between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090203"&gt;30% and 50% of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is permanently infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; due to the many ways the parasite can spread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can target male reproductive organs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon infection, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; spreads to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12163"&gt;virtually every organ and skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3755328"&gt;during the height of the AIDS pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, when some patients presented with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;parasitic infection in their testes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis, it can also occur in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2018-224962"&gt;otherwise healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. Imaging studies of infected mice confirm that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; parasites &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00517.x"&gt;quickly travel to the testes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the brain and eyes within days of infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" alt="Microscopy image of translucent, two-layers circular blobs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; cysts floating in cat feces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/toxoplasmosis/index.html"&gt;DPDx Image Library/CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2017, my colleagues and I found that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;form cysts in mouse prostates&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have also observed these parasites in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;ejaculate of many animals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.10.034"&gt;human semen&lt;/a&gt;, raising the possibility of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109725"&gt;sexual transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reside in male reproductive organs has prompted analyses of fertility in infected men. A small 2021 study in Prague of 163 men infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12969"&gt;over 86% had semen anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2002 study in China found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479125/"&gt;infertile couples are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; infection than fertile couples, 34.83% versus 12.11%. A 2005 study in China also found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078665"&gt;sterile men are more likely to test positive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; than fertile men. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622295/"&gt;Not all studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, produce a link between toxoplasmosis and sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can directly damage human sperm&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans, which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people. Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;-infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096770"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108571"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9121004"&gt;rams&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107573"&gt;abnormally shaped sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that April 2025 study, researchers from Germany, Uruguay, and Chile observed that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reach the testes &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/epididymis"&gt;and epididymis&lt;/a&gt;, the tube where sperm mature and are stored, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;two days after infection&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;22.4% of sperm cells were beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites. Sperm cells that maintained their head were often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;twisted and misshapen&lt;/a&gt;. Some sperm cells had holes in their head, suggesting the parasites were trying to invade them as it would any other type of cell in the organs it infiltrates. In addition to direct contact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may also damage sperm because the infection promotes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Inflammatory conditions in the male reproductive tract are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913230/"&gt;harmful to sperm production and function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the harmful effects &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may have on sperm could be contributing to large global declines in male fertility over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" alt="Series of microscopy images of slightly deformed sperm with holes in their heads"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Sperm exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;.

The two nonconfronted controls at the bottom show normal sperm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;Rojas-Barón et al/The FEBS Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Preventing toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can infiltrate male reproductive organs in animals is compelling, but whether this produces health issues in people remains unclear. Testicular toxoplasmosis shows that parasites can invade human testes, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2025.116709"&gt;symptomatic disease is very rare&lt;/a&gt;. Studies to date that show defects in the sperm of infected men are too small to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Additionally, some reports suggest that rates of toxoplasmosis in high-income countries &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.10.003"&gt;have not been increasing&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades while male infertility was rising, so it’s likely to only be one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless of this parasite’s potential effect on fertility, it is wise to avoid &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. An infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects if someone acquires it for the first time during pregnancy, and it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people. &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; is also the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death from foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23408"&gt;proper care of your cat&lt;/a&gt;, promptly cleaning the litter box and thoroughly washing your hands after can help reduce your exposure to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. You can also protect yourself from this parasite by washing fruits and vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures"&gt;cooking meat to proper temperatures&lt;/a&gt; before consuming and avoiding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/605433"&gt;raw shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-raw-water-compare-to-tap-water-a-microbiologist-explains-why-the-risks-outweigh-the-benefits-246866"&gt;raw water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1982.03330140038029"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/bill-sullivan-703249"&gt;Bill Sullivan&lt;/a&gt;, Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/indiana-university-1368"&gt;Indiana University&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Friday night after a l-o-o-o-ng week can seem like the perfect time to order takeout and unwind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating takeout regularly can increase your visceral fat stores, which is linked to health issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, try making your favorite takeout dish at home to help lose visceral fat.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After a long week, Friday seems like the perfect time to order takeout and cozy up in front of the television to watch your favorite show. While dining out or ordering takeout are convenient ways to nourish yourself, it also means you have less control over the ingredients. And if you’re eating out on the regular, you may be overdoing it on calories, fat and sodium, which can lead to weight gain and inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what if you could make a quick, delicious and better-for-you version of your favorite dish at home, saving you money and giving you more control over the ingredients used? This simple weekly swap could help you lose visceral fat, which is found deep in your stomach area surrounding some of your internal organs.&lt;a href="https://www.jackietopol.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Jackie Topol, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, says, “This type of fat is metabolically active and has been strongly linked to increased inflammation and higher risk for conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinaiconciergecare.org/maria-fraga-rd/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maria Elena Fraga, RD&lt;/a&gt;, says, “Certain lifestyle factors increase your risk of visceral fat. Excessive alcohol intake, a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, poor sleep, chronic stress and overeating are factors you can control.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on what you order, takeout meals can be high in calories, saturated fat, sugar and sodium. Oftentimes, ordering in also means &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8018354/can-you-practice-mindful-eating-while-trying-to-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;distracted eating&lt;/a&gt;—whether you’re watching TV or scrolling on your phone. This type of eating may result in overeating, a risk factor for visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s why swapping your Friday-evening takeout for a healthier, DIY version is the No. 1 habit you should start to help lose visceral fat. Dietitians share all the reasons why making the switch will help you lose visceral fat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Takeout Dishes Can Be High in Calories and Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fraga shares, “Many takeout meals are calorie-dense and high in trans and saturated fats, which promote visceral fat accumulation.” In a cross-sectional study, researchers evaluated the connection between specific types of food and visceral fat. They found that people who consumed more saturated fat, total fat and white potatoes had more visceral fat. On the other hand, those who consumed more fiber with higher dietary intake of total vegetables, total fruits (including juice), cereals, whole grains, dietary fiber and calcium had lower amounts of visceral fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Takeout Foods Tend to Be High in Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Salt is a food preservative and a mineral that enhances the flavor of foods. It’s also often overused. A review article that included more than 50 studies found a positive association between &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894212/ways-to-flush-out-excess-sodium-from-your-body/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium intake&lt;/a&gt; and body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the reasons for this is that foods that are high in sodium are often higher in calories and saturated fat. “Takeout is usually loaded with salt, which can increase water retention and raise blood pressure—both of which impact heart and metabolic health,” says Fraga.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Bigger Portions May Lead to Overeating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oversized portions are common for takeout orders or restaurant meals. Your intentions to save some for your next meal are great, but dishes that taste oh-so-good can be hard to resist. Overeating can leave you feeling tired and uncomfortable. Consistently eating more than your body needs can cause weight gain
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cooking at home means you have control over &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8019115/what-are-portion-sizes-do-they-matter/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your portions&lt;/a&gt;. If your dish makes multiple servings, portion it out into multiple containers for later. This will give you something to eat tomorrow and help you avoid overeating.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Easy Ordering Often Means Mindless Eating &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating takeout often means eating in front of screens, which increases the risk of overeating,” says Fraga. Distracted eating or mindless eating can cause you to overconsume calories. It can also impact your food choices, taste perception and your ability to recognize when you are full.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Making your meal at home takes effort, and to enjoy the fruits of your labor, you might be more likely to sit down and eat. Sharing a meal with a loved one is another way to enjoy a home-cooked meal and prevent distracted eating.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Exercising regularly, both cardio and strength training, has been shown to reduce visceral fat,” says Topol. Physical activity guidelines recommend engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Start moving by breaking up your time sitting.

Go for walks, swim, play pickleball or hit the gym with a friend. If you enjoy what you are doing, you are more likely to make it a habit.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating an abundance of different plants can help you reach your fiber goals. By increasing your intake of plants, you will consume more fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Dietitians put this on top of the list of habits to form if you are looking to lose visceral fat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep is important for health and longevity. “Not getting enough sleep or poor sleep is linked to higher visceral fat levels,” says Topol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Evaluate your sleep patterns to see where improvements can be made. Can you try to go to bed and wake up around the same time daily? Get support if you need help with formulating a plan. Topol recommends, “Work with a dietitian who takes a holistic approach to get a personalized nutrition plan that also addresses lifestyle factors.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ordering your favorite takeout food once in a while is not going to prevent you from losing visceral fat. It is not about single meals, but rather your overall dietary patterns. Topol says, “It is not just about where you eat, but what you eat and how often. If you are mindful about your food choices and watching portion sizes, eating out does not have to negatively impact health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, if you are someone who regularly celebrates Fridays with takeout and dines out regularly, making a simple swap to cook your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291719/why-cooking-no-matter-the-recipe-is-better-for-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Friday night dinner&lt;/a&gt; could save calories, fat and sodium, while also increasing your intake of fiber, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to what you eat regularly, how you move your body and your sleep habits can support your overall health and reduce visceral fat. It’s all about stacking on healthy lifestyle habits. Take it one meal or one behavior at a time. You make the most significant impact when you are consistent.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was in a coma for a little over a month due to sepsis following a perforated ulcer in my GI tract. I don't remember hearing anyone, although family and friends read to me, played recorded videos, etc. I remember 'being' in a dim, small room with velvet-flocked wallpaper, and 'being' in an Orange Julius in a mall food court with strangers. Then, I heard my mom say she was leaving on Thursday. I woke up and thought two days had passed."&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"&lt;b&gt;I lost more than a month, a third of my body weight, all my muscle tone, a lot of hair, and my vocal cords were damaged due to an emergency intubation.&lt;/b&gt; It took another month to regain muscle control to write notes and for my vocal cords and esophageal muscles to start healing. I had failed three swallow tests before I finally passed. It took over 11 weeks from ER admit to discharge. I had months of OT, PT, and speech afterwards. Fifteen months after discharge, I was completely cleared by all but GI doctor!!!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sportygoose966"&gt;sportygoose966&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers reviewed and re-analyzed data from dozens of studies to clarify when depression most strongly affects dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest late-life depression may be more than just a risk factor—it could be an early sign of dementia onset. These insights emphasize the urgent need to prioritize mental health care as a long-term strategy to protect brain health and prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifelong Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression in both midlife and later life increases dementia risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Warning Sign:&lt;/strong&gt; Late-life depression may signal the early stages of dementia development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Strategy Needed:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental health care should be central to dementia prevention efforts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found that depression is linked to an increased risk of dementia in both mid and later life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, which is published in &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine, &lt;/em&gt;was led by Jacob Brain and Maha Alshahrani from the Institute of Mental Health and School of Medicine at the University of Nottingham, University of Adelaide and the Dementia Centre of Excellence at Curtin University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110495"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg" alt="This shows a face and brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-dementia-neurosciencce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This new research brings together all the existing evidence and adds new analysis to examine this timing in more detail. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brain said: “Our study shows that depression is linked to an increased risk of dementia in both midlife and late life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This highlights the importance of recognising and treating depression across the life course, not just for mental health, but also as part of a broader strategy to protect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public health efforts need to place greater emphasis on preventative brain health, including scaling up access to effective mental health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia affects over 57 million people globally. There is currently no cure, so identifying and treating the factors to reduce the risk, such as depression, is an important public health priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential links between depression and dementia are complex and may include chronic inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, vascular changes, alterations to neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitter imbalances. Shared genetic and behavioural related changes may also increase the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that people with depression are more likely to develop dementia later in life, but there’s been a lot of debate about &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; depression matters most, whether it’s depression that starts in midlife – in your 40s or 50s, or depression that appears later in life – in your 60s or beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research brings together all the existing evidence and adds new analysis to examine this timing in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings raise the possibility that depression late in life may not just be a risk factor, but it could also be an early warning sign of dementia beginning to develop. By clarifying this timing, our work helps guide future research, treatment, and prevention strategies,” says Mr Brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out an umbrella review and meta-analysis. They firstly gathered and reviewed all the best available data from systematic reviews with meta-analyses (a statistical method that combines results from multiple studies to provide a more reliable overall estimate), that had already looked at the link between depression and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then went a step further by extracting and re-analysing data from the individual studies within those reviews, plus they added in newer studies that were missed in the earlier work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Brain adds: “We specifically focused on the &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt; of when depression was measured, whether it was measured in midlife or in later life, and calculated how much it increased the risk of developing dementia. This essentially allowed us to provide a more accurate and up-to-date picture of how depression at different life stages is linked to dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression and dementia research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e5d565f4c52514a4a5b10495f52527e50514a4a575059565f53105f5d104b55" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Wall – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2025.103266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Temporal dynamics in the association between depression and dementia: an umbrella review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;” by Jacob Brain et al. &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal dynamics in the association between depression and dementia: an umbrella review and meta-analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying modifiable risk factors is crucial for dementia prevention, a global health concern. Depression is considered a risk factor for dementia, but the temporal dynamics across the life course remain inconclusive. Therefore, we aimed to systematically assess the relationship between the timing of depression assessment and risk of all-cause late-life dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted an umbrella review and meta-analysis to assess incident dementia in individuals with non-current history of depression. PubMed and Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo were searched from inception up to February 17, 2025. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses investigating the association between depression and incident late-life dementia were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From eligible reviews, we also extracted data from studies reporting dementia risk as hazard ratios (HRs), analysing the timing of depression measurement using random-effects models for meta-analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021249706.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 7763 records identified, nine reviews were eligible for inclusion of the umbrella review. One review was judged to be of moderate quality, while the others were either low (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 3) or critically low (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5). For our meta-analyses, 18 studies reporting depression onset in later life (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 901,762 participants, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7595 incident dementia cases) and seven studies on depression assessed during midlife (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 2,501,269 participants, &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; ≥ 276,929 incident dementia cases) were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All studies in the meta-analyses were deemed to be of good quality, with no strong evidence of publication bias. Pooled HRs indicated depression present in late-life (HR 1.95, 95% CI: 1.68–2.26; &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 77.5%) and midlife (HR 1.56, 95% CI: 1.12–2.18; &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 97.5%) significantly increased risk of all-cause dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that depression across the life course may increase dementia risk; however, substantial heterogeneity and review quality should be considered when interpreting the strength of this evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life course approach to the treatment and prevention of depression may help reduce the burden of dementia, but this will require scaling up access to effective mental health care for vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to clarify if the stronger late-life association reflects depression as an immediate risk factor or an early manifestation of neurodegenerative processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Institute for Health and Care Research, UK Research and Innovation, and Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 13:47:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE9qYmcwcmxSUl9zajQ5cXBTemJEYm9QOVZHM1RCSU9VZ1N1YUVER21lQm5UaEZ1SXd3WllNbVFEb3lSczJHaEE1Y1ozbEZMTWpfTFpicDA4OHA0NHdkV1E1SHlLWWlneWtDeDZBVVIyQjhBZTJySkRZ</guid></item><item><title>医生解释了Ozempic的“百年统治” ，因为模拟显示了该药物的残酷“后果” - LADbible | Doctor explains '100-year-old rule' over Ozempic as simulation shows brutal 'aftermath' of the drug - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPNEdRSi1JT3U5aG5pM0ZzdWJrajBQSzNLQkN1XzNDX2g3Q1c4Z1lqSWwxRFFjaUxOQ3ZXZnZ5T1BwT3h4a3FQLURJYnFwdHZMeG9lRGtVdU53R1Y4Tmd2ZEQ4M1VfNWtRb2VtVTV5SlRCUDMxTld3NmRFano2RHJpbnctbGNsazJEVXZCM3dR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A doctor has spoken about a rule she has when it comes to making decisions on her health as she discussed the impacts of Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;There are plenty of weight loss drugs on the market which work by telling your brain you're full so you won't eat as much, with the idea that it'll significantly lower your calorific intake and cause you to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, it's not as simple as jabbing yourself thinner, as there are plenty of other health impacts of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Some people taking the likes of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, Wegovy, Mounjaro and others &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-aftermath-side-effects-warning-doctors-fasting-uk-123012-20250525"&gt;have noticed side effects&lt;/a&gt;, especially on their digestive systems, and the simulations aren't particularly pretty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking about the impact of drugs like Ozempic, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/good-night-sleep-stop-eating-eight-hours-080320-20241207"&gt;Dr Mindy Pelz&lt;/a&gt; appeared on the &lt;em&gt;Diary of a CEO&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjIXLQ_OdA"&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; to say how the drug had some 'amazing upsides' and warned not to 'totally villainise it', but that with every &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health decision&lt;/a&gt; she wanted to keep her '100-year-old' rule in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The doctor said it could be a 'lifeline' for people going through a 'massive metabolic crisis', but hammered home the point that there was no easy ticket to a healthy life and the real key was your lifestyle itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"In the end you are going to have to make health your responsibility, and you're going to have to work for it, especially as you age," Dr Pelz pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"One of my guiding principles that I always think about is my 100-year-old self.

Researchers discovered that glioblastoma stem cells rely on the protein connexin 43’s interaction with microtubules, an interaction disrupted by JM2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This selective peptide therapy effectively killed glioblastoma stem-like cells in lab tests while sparing healthy brain cells, and significantly slowed tumor growth in animal models. The findings represent a major step toward peptide-based cancer therapies that attack the root of tumor regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connexin 43 Targeting:&lt;/strong&gt; JM2 disrupts the interaction between connexin 43 and microtubules, weakening glioblastoma stem cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Toxicity:&lt;/strong&gt; JM2 is lethal to glioblastoma stem-like cells but leaves healthy brain cells unaffected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumor Suppression:&lt;/strong&gt; In preclinical models, JM2 significantly slowed tumor regrowth after standard treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lab-designed molecule developed and extensively studied by scientists with Virginia Tech’s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC could represent a breakthrough in slowing tumor recurrence in glioblastoma, an aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in May in &lt;em&gt;Cell Death and Disease&lt;/em&gt;, researchers identified a previously unknown trait of cancer cells that shows promise for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110487"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glioblastoma-peptide-stem-cells-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings support JM2 as a promising new peptide-based drug for targeting the glioblastoma stem cells that drive tumor recurrence following treatment. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group outlined the mechanism of action and effectiveness of the experimental drug known as JM2, revealing its potential as a peptide therapy to target cancer cells that can renew and regrow, even after chemotherapy and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma, the most common form of malignant brain tumor, is particularly difficult to treat. The median survival after diagnosis is just over 14 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment typically involves surgically removing as much of the tumor as possible, followed by radiation and chemotherapy with a drug called temozolomide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, glioblastoma always recurs due to the presence of treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells. These cancer cells can survive, even after standard therapies, leading to tumor regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Glioblastoma stem cells can adapt easily to both their environment and treatment,” said Samy Lamouille, corresponding author of the study and an assistant professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These cells can lie dormant, and at some point, they reawaken and then rebuild the tumor. It’s critical to find a way to target this population of cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lamouille lab studies how cancer cells communicate with each other and with their surrounding environment, with a particular focus on connexin 43. That protein plays a key role in forming gap junctions, which enable direct cell-to-cell communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Connexin 43 plays a complex role in cancer,” Lamouille said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depending on its expression and localization in cancer cells, it can both suppress and support cancer growth.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimenting with laboratory-grown glioblastoma stem-like cells, Lamouille turned to super-resolution microscopy, a powerful technique that allows researchers to visualize and localize proteins at nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associate Professor James Smyth specializes in this technique to study gap junctions and connexin proteins in heart disease. Together, they discovered for the first time that connexin 43 is strongly associated with microtubules in these cells, decorating them along their entire length. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this discovery, Lamouille came up with the idea to use JM2, a connexin 43-derived peptide that mimics the microtubule-interacting domain of connexin 43, to further explore its role in glioblastoma stem cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Gourdie, the Heywood Fralin professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, developed the JM2 peptide with his laboratory while at the Medical University of South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we tested JM2 in glioblastoma stem-like cells, that was the most exciting moment,” Lamouille said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only did that efficiently disrupt connexin 43 interaction with microtubules, but JM2 was also toxic specifically for these particular cells, leaving healthy brain cells unharmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It achieved the effect without affecting connexin 43’s other crucial functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond glioblastoma, the work represents a significant step toward identifying a novel tumorigenic function for connexin 43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can remember presentations by the team in which the three-dimensional gliospheres used to model tumors in the culture dish were clearly getting smaller,” said co-author Gourdie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising to see such a drastic effect on glioblastoma. The JM2 peptide had a killing effect by itself. That was unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through further testing in both cell cultures and living organisms, the researchers found that JM2 disrupts the maintenance of these treatment-resistant cancer cells in laboratory experiments and significantly slows tumor growth in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings support JM2 as a promising new peptide-based drug for targeting the glioblastoma stem cells that drive tumor recurrence following treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also highlights the partnership between Virginia Tech’s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and Carilion Clinic, a health system in Southwest Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Michael Lunski was a Carilion Clinic resident who conducted research in Lamouille’s laboratory, which is adjacent to that of Assistant Professor Zhi Sheng. Sheng provided glioblastoma cells that helped lead to the discovery; these lab cultures were derived from tumor cells donated with the consent of brain cancer patients in Southwest Virginia receiving care from Carilion physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed to develop the therapy for use and determine whether it will be safe and effective in humans, preclinical findings suggest that combining JM2 with chemotherapy could improve patients’ survival by slowing recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To advance the approach, Lamouille is now experimenting with novel delivery mechanisms specifically targeting the JM2 peptide to glioblastoma cells, including biodegradable nanoparticles and viral vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;Lamouille and Gourdie are co-founders of Acomhal Research Inc., which licensed the JM2 peptide in an effort to bring new therapies to cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this glioblastoma brain cancer research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cca0ada7a9a0a0a9b58cbab8e2a9a8b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Leigh Anne Kelley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leigh Anne Kelley – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41419-025-07514-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cytoplasmic connexin43-microtubule interactions promote glioblastoma stem-like cell maintenance and tumorigenicity&lt;/a&gt;” by Samy Lamouille et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Death and Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cytoplasmic connexin43-microtubule interactions promote glioblastoma stem-like cell maintenance and tumorigenicity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary tumor of the central nervous system. One major challenge in GBM treatment is the resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy observed in subpopulations of cancer cells, including GBM stem-like cells (GSCs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cells have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate and as such, GSCs participate in tumor recurrence following treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) has complex roles in oncogenesis and we have previously demonstrated an association between Cx43 and GBM chemotherapy resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report, for the first time, increased direct interaction between non-junctional Cx43 and microtubules in the cytoplasm of GSCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesize that non-junctional Cx43/microtubule complexing is critical for GSC maintenance and survival and sought to specifically disrupt this interaction while maintaining other Cx43 functions, such as gap junction formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a Cx43 mimetic peptide of the carboxyl terminal tubulin-binding domain of Cx43 (JM2), we successfully disrupted Cx43 interaction with microtubules in GSCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, administration of JM2 significantly decreased GSC survival in vitro, and limited GSC-derived and GBM patient-derived xenograft tumor growth in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these results identify JM2 as a novel peptide drug to ablate GSCs in GBM treatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 12:53:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9XblhWak9VdmJxU1FaRWtHWVUzYnQxaUR3UGFKS2lqdFBLdk1ZbVpzQXZBYVBiS3RHUzVwSllSN054UUk5VVdMTmRzT25abUNfNGhyaS0xQi1hZmliRWZmMEJjaE8wTkRTdjlUS2k1MmplZGs</guid></item><item><title>7件意想不到的物品急诊室医生总是去度假- HuffPost | 7 Unexpected Items ER Doctors Always Take On Vacation - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPZHhvZEZkTVQ5MjRkNVlCU0x4ZVhpZEx6UGV5aGxieklZcVlVUGlDVDg5RlpVSDA3Zng2aDN3RHR6MzlVWG9JYkNVUnJnR1k0STZVc0ZBbVItcVpUakRaaTFxM1ZmLWFVYUVVcmUwTVh4STRIRnEzMkY4STJxRzhHTHVkWkYxbWl5VVhrU201WTB6ZC1lN3VUUFRjejM5WEhnZlRB0gGoAUFVX3lxTE9seV94Tk9UbVh5eEhPZmZVZENYWWt3bk0wZjRhU1ZoajhrUHlSSWhoVDBuZTdEWThjSHZIWHUyUXBNYWhzeVRvVWpoVmNJNHlVb1dodVFlVUhpMmZaQTBacERxYWRqQVlWdEE4eE5fYldEQXNhQkhpR0ZnWFRrcVpzYlRfZlJ5LXpuOG5QOWFzUU90cjVJeFFyeWF5UmlsdzIzSDlfYVp6Yg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Getting sick on vacation happens more than most people realize: nearly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/vacation-sick-hurt-survey" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="30% " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a90e4b0c2f07d8c7877" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.valuepenguin.com/vacation-sick-hurt-survey" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;30% &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;of Americans say they’ve gotten sick or injured on a trip, throwing their travel plans for a loop. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While there’s only so much you can do to lower the risk of getting sick on vacation, emergency room doctors say it’s important to be prepared for certain situations. “You don’t want to ruin a great vacation with some type of bad event that happens to you,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/eric-adkins-md-29826" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Eric Adkins" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a90e4b0c2f07d8c7877" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/eric-adkins-md-29826" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Eric Adkins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an emergency medicine physician at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Sometimes you can prepare for simpler events.

With that in mind, we tapped four emergency room physicians for details on what they always reach for when it’s time to pack. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Nausea Medication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Several doctors we spoke to said they always have anti-nausea medication ready. “Always pack Zofran, just in case,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/cedric-dark-20229" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Cedric Dark" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a90e4b0c2f07d8c7877" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/cedric-dark-20229" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Cedric Dark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associate professor of emergency medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. “The feeling of nausea and vomiting is one of the most hated things you could ever imagine and there’s nothing over-the-counter that is that helpful.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adkins calls Zofran (generic name: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;ondansetron)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; “essential,” adding, “I’ll always have that with me.” He remembers a vacation a few years ago when Zofran came in handy as his family went on a whale-watching trip. “Four out of five of us vomited,” he said. “I was glad we had Zofran with us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The medication is only available by prescription, which is why Adkins recommends talking to your primary care physician before your trip. “It dissolves under your tongue,” he said. “It still works, even if you are having trouble keeping things down.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Bug Zapper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dark lists this as a must if he’s traveling someplace tropical.

Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that’s odorless and colorless, and it’s produced when fuels like gasoline, oil, charcoal and natural gas burn incompletely, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-carbon-monoxide" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Environmental Protection Agency" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a90e4b0c2f07d8c7877" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-carbon-monoxide" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (EPA). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In low concentrations, carbon monoxide can cause fatigue and chest pain; In high concentrations, it can cause flu-like symptoms and even be deadly. Because the gas is odorless and colorless, it can be hard to know if you’re being exposed without a carbon monoxide detector. Luckily, there are plenty of portable carbon monoxide detectors that can easily be packed in a suitcase.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This is a recent addition to my travel bag,” Crook said. “It’s easy to bring and may save a life.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melatonin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lack of sleep can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8602722/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="weaken" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e0a90e4b0c2f07d8c7877" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8602722/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;weaken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; your immune system, leaving you vulnerable to getting sick.

&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a disease that is one of the most contagious diseases that we know about,” Dr. Sarah Rudman, acting health officer and director for Santa Clara County’s Department of Public Health said at a news conference Friday morning. “We know that the average person with measles can get up to 14 people sick, and you can imagine — 14 times 14 times 14 spreads incredibly quickly if the population is unvaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudman added that despite the high rate of spread, the counties expect to be able to contain the spread of measles due to high vaccination rates as long as individuals who were exposed follow public health recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After passing through an unspecified U.S. airport, the person visited the H Mart at 1710 Oakland Road in San Jose between 7:15 p.m. and 9 p.m. on May 21, the Starbucks at 35040 Newark Boulevard in Newark between 11:45 a.m. and 2 p.m. on May 23 and the Trader Joe’s at 1306 Great Mall Parkway in Milpitas between 4:45 p.m. and 8 p.m. on May 25, the Alameda and Santa Clara county public health departments said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Members of the public may be at risk of getting measles if they visited the sites at those times and are not immune to the disease or are unsure whether they were vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The exact number of how many people have been exposed is unknown,” Rudman said. “That’s why we’re asking everyone to take a look at these three locations, the specific times when the contagious person was there and if they understand that they were in that same location at that same time, they are considered exposed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who meets that criteria should review their immunization records to see if they are protected; call their health care provider if they are pregnant, the parent of an infant, have a weakened immune system or are unvaccinated against measles; and monitor for symptoms for seven to 21 days after the day of potential exposure, according to health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of the disease include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a rash, which usually appears 7 to 21 days after exposure. Health officials urged anyone with symptoms to call ahead to their medical facility before seeking treatment. Measles is an airborne disease, Rudman said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Most members of the community have a “very high degree of protection and (are) very unlikely to get sick from that exposure” because of vaccination, Rudman added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kavita Trivedi, director of clinical guidance and communicable disease controller at the Alameda County Public Health Department, said that people who are exposed and exhibiting symptoms should immediately contact their healthcare provider. These individuals should be sure to call their doctor ahead of time so as not to expose other people in waiting rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the infected person may have been exposed to the disease at the airport. That person was not hospitalized and are isolating at home, according to health officials. The individual, who is an adult, is recovering well, Rudman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent case of measles in Santa Clara County was in 2019, Rudman said. Alameda County had a case of measles in 2024, Trivedi said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Trivedi added that the Bay Area has high rates of vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re very fortunate in the Bay Area to have the benefit of high vaccination rates,” Trivedi said. “Young children, unvaccinated children, unvaccinated adults, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems are at greater risk for developing severe complications from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trivedi added that the MMR vaccine is “safe and highly effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Two doses of MMR vaccine is the best protection against measles,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the state, MMR vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/01/as-texas-outbreak-grows-californias-measles-vaccination-rate-struggles-to-recover-after-pandemic/"&gt;dipped during the COVID-19 pandemic and have struggled to recover&lt;/a&gt; since. In Alameda County, MMR &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/28/one-local-county-is-particularly-at-risk-as-measles-outbreaks-grow/"&gt;vaccination rates of kindergarteners dropped nearly one percentage point&lt;/a&gt; from the 2022-2023 year to 2023-2024. In Santa Clara County, the rates remained largely steady from 98.7% to 98.6% over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California’s statewide MMR vaccination rate sat at 96.2% of kindergarteners, putting the state well ahead of a nationwide rate of 92.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States has seen &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/05/07/11-us-states-with-measles-outbreak/"&gt;measles outbreaks in eleven states&lt;/a&gt;, with some 1,000 cases nationwide, triple the number from 2024. A &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/04/26/stanford-measles-vaccination-rates/"&gt;recent Stanford University study predicted that measles could return to endemic level&lt;/a&gt; within two decades if current downward vaccination trends continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudman also expressed appreciation to the businesses who are cooperating with public health authorities to protect their staff and patrons. There is no further risk in going to these businesses now, she added.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01227-8" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; found that sucralose increases activity in the hypothalamus—a key brain region involved in appetite regulation—compared to caloric sugar (sucrose) and water. The findings suggest that even though sucralose lacks calories, it can trigger neural responses linked to increased hunger and alter the way the brain communicates with areas involved in motivation and sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sucralose is a popular sugar substitute used in many diet sodas, baked goods, and low-calorie snacks. It provides a sweet taste without adding calories, which makes it attractive for people trying to lose weight or control blood sugar. However, while it may reduce calorie intake in the short term, its effects on appetite and metabolism are not fully understood. Some researchers have speculated that sucralose might confuse the brain’s hunger-regulating circuits by delivering sweetness without the expected nutrients that usually follow sugar intake. This mismatch may disrupt normal appetite control and possibly promote overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these effects, researchers at the University of Southern California conducted a randomized crossover trial involving 75 young adults between the ages of 18 and 35. The participants included individuals with healthy weight, overweight, and obesity. Each participant attended three separate sessions during which they consumed one of three drinks: a sucralose-sweetened beverage, a sucrose-sweetened beverage with the same level of sweetness, or water as a control. The sessions were spaced at least two days apart, and the order of drinks was randomized and blinded to both participants and experimenters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after each drink, the researchers used functional MRI to measure blood flow in the hypothalamus and assess brain activity. Increases in hypothalamic blood flow are associated with hunger, while reductions typically occur after eating and are linked to satiety. In addition to brain imaging, researchers collected blood samples to measure glucose, insulin, and GLP-1 (a hormone involved in satiety), and they asked participants to rate their hunger at multiple time points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that consuming sucralose, compared to sucrose and water, increased blood flow in the lateral hypothalamus. This region is known to be involved in triggering hunger and motivating food-seeking behavior. Notably, sucralose consumption also increased self-reported hunger levels compared to sucrose, despite containing no calories. In contrast, sucrose consumption led to increases in blood glucose and decreases in medial hypothalamic blood flow—responses typically associated with feelings of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging also revealed that sucralose altered the functional connectivity between the hypothalamus and other brain regions. For example, after drinking sucralose, participants showed stronger connections between the hypothalamus and areas involved in motivation (like the anterior cingulate cortex) and body awareness (such as the parietal lobule). These changes suggest that sucralose may heighten the brain’s responsiveness to food cues or amplify motivational signals related to eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the effects of sucralose varied by body weight and sex. Among participants with healthy weight, sucralose triggered greater hypothalamic activation compared to sucrose, while individuals with obesity showed stronger responses to sucralose compared to water. Those who were overweight fell somewhere in between. Additionally, women showed stronger brain responses to sucralose than men, consistent with previous research suggesting sex differences in sensitivity to food cues and sweet taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the sucrose drink caused measurable increases in glucose, insulin, and GLP-1, sucralose did not. Importantly, the drop in medial hypothalamic blood flow after sucrose ingestion was associated with increased glucose levels and reduced hunger, reinforcing the idea that nutrient signals—especially glucose—help suppress appetite via hypothalamic pathways. These relationships were not seen after sucralose consumption, which did not raise glucose or suppress hypothalamic activity in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored how individual differences in insulin sensitivity affected brain responses. Participants with lower insulin sensitivity, a marker of metabolic dysfunction, showed greater hypothalamic responses to sucralose than those with higher insulin sensitivity. This finding suggests that people with impaired metabolic function may be more sensitive to the appetite-related effects of non-caloric sweeteners, although more research is needed to confirm this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study highlights a paradox: sucralose does not provide calories, but it can stimulate the brain in ways that resemble hunger. The sweet taste, uncoupled from the expected metabolic signals that typically accompany caloric intake, appears to disrupt normal appetite signaling in the hypothalamus. Over time, this could potentially lead to increased food consumption or altered eating patterns, although the study only examined short-term effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kathleen Alanna Page, the study’s senior author and director of the USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute, these findings raise new questions about the widespread use of artificial sweeteners. “Are these substances actually helpful for regulating body weight? What happens in the body and brain when we consume them, and do the effects differ from one person to the next?” she asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides evidence about how sucralose affects the brain, it also has some limitations. The researchers focused on short-term responses to single doses of sucralose under controlled conditions. Long-term studies are needed to determine whether repeated exposure to non-caloric sweeteners leads to sustained changes in appetite, eating behavior, or body weight. In addition, although the study matched drinks for sweetness intensity, it did not measure participants’ subjective experience of sweet taste or their preferences, which could influence brain responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noted that their participant group consisted of young, healthy adults who were not trying to lose weight. Results might differ in older adults, individuals with diabetes, or those actively managing their weight. The study also focused only on sucralose, leaving open the question of whether other sweeteners—such as aspartame, saccharin, or stevia—have similar or different effects on the brain and appetite regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address some of these gaps, Page and her team have launched a follow-up study examining how non-caloric sweeteners affect brain development and appetite regulation in children and adolescents, who are among the heaviest consumers of sugar substitutes. “The brain is vulnerable during this time,” Page explained, “so it could be a critical opportunity to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01227-8" target="_blank"&gt;Non-caloric sweetener effects on brain appetite regulation in individuals across varying body weights&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sandhya P.

			&lt;p&gt;Not all sugary treats hit the same. According to new research, gulping down a sweet beverage may be worse for your metabolic health than munching on a sweet snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The systematic review brings together health data from over half a million adults around the world, and it finds that each additional serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage or fruit juice per day is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="163059" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary sugar, on the other hand, was linked to a &lt;i&gt;lower&lt;/i&gt; risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that not all sugar is equally bad for you. Some types and amounts may be more associated with insulin issues than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first study to draw clear dose-response relationships between different sugar sources and type 2 diabetes risk," &lt;a href="https://news.byu.edu/intellect/rethinking-sugar-byu-study-shows-food-source-is-key-to-understanding-diabetes-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; nutritional scientist Karen Della Corte from Brigham Young University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It highlights why drinking your sugar – whether from soda or juice – is more problematic for health than eating it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_163088" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163088" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/type-2-infographic-642x361.png" alt="Diabetes CDC Fact Sheet" class="size-medium wp-image-163088" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/type-2-infographic-642x361.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/type-2-infographic-738x415.png 738w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/type-2-infographic-768x432.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/type-2-infographic-600x338.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/type-2-infographic.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-163088" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is a popular belief that dietary sugars are linked to diabetes. But some researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41430-022-01114-5"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that assumption lacks persuasive data. They say type 2 diabetes is more clearly tied to excess energy intake or excess body fat gain, rather than sugar alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, for instance, researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15143274"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a significant association between total sugar intake and an increased risk of diabetes, and yet that relationship was closely tied to a person's body mass index. The findings suggest that sugar facilitates weight gain, indirectly impacting the body's metabolism. But could it have other health impacts, too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more, Della Corte and her colleagues compared the risk of diabetes from daily doses of fructose, sucrose, free sugars (which are naturally occurring, like in honey), added sugars, and total sugars. They also zeroed in on sugar-sweetened beverages, like soft drinks or sports drinks, and fruit juice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk of developing type 2 diabetes differed depending on which sugar was consumed. Intakes of sucrose and total sugar were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, while no associations were found for added sugar and fructose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other sugars, however, were tied to the opposite outcome. Each additional daily serving of a soft drink increased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 25 percent in the current study. Plus, each extra serving of fruit juice increased the risk by 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was true even after researchers adjusted for a person's body mass and energy intake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not mean that each time you drink a can of soda, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes goes up by 25 percent. These are relative, not absolute risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on these numbers, if you had a baseline risk of developing diabetes that was 10 percent, for instance, then having four sodas a day would raise that risk to 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study highlights a concerning correlation, but further research is needed to understand why fruit juice may be more damaging to the body's metabolism than, say, an actual piece of fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The high sugar content and lack of fiber in fruit juice are similar to sugar-sweetened beverages, making it a poor substitute for whole fruits, which provide higher fiber content to support better blood glucose regulation," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2025.100413"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Sugar-sweetened beverages supply isolated sugars leading to a greater glycemic impact, whereas other sources of dietary sugars, particularly when consumed in nutrient-dense foods such as whole fruits, dairy products, or whole grains, may elicit slower blood glucose responses due to accompanying fiber, fats, or proteins."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than "condemning all added sugars", the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2025.100413"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that future nutrition guidelines should consider the context in which sugars are eaten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a solid foundation of nutrient-dense foods, some types of sweet treats may be more dangerous than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advnut.2025.100413"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — The president of Hickman Family Farms took time Thursday to explain what happens next after a recent bird flu outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glenn Hickman told &lt;em&gt;KTAR News 92.3 FM’s The Mike Broomhead Show&lt;/em&gt; that avian influenza was detected at two West Valley egg farms with a total of 3 million chickens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will lose 100% of those birds,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company detected the illness on May 15, Hickman said. The Arizona Department of Agriculture later &lt;a href="https://ktar.com/arizona-health-news/bird-flu-arizona/5710682/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;confirmed it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We saw an uptick in mortality in the barns, and we took samples and they were diagnosed to have bird flu,” Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are there any health risks consumers should be worried about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickman said consumers don’t have to worry about health problems related to the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In terms of food safety, there’s never been any instances where someone was got sick with bird flu from eating an egg,” Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, shoppers don’t have to worry about contaminated eggs showing up on Valley grocery store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As soon as the diagnosis is in, the eggs are no longer available for sale at retail. So we don’t use any of those eggs,” Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, chickens succumb to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;avian influenza&lt;/a&gt; so quicky that they stop laying eggs, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Production goes down dramatically very quickly,” Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How will news of bird flu in West Valley egg farms impact grocery prices?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite news that the avian influenza has hit millions of their flock, Hickman doesn’t foresee egg prices bouncing back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The net effect is that we are going to not probably bump the needle very much when it comes to retail pricing at the stores,” Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he thinks it will take his business two years to bounce back to full production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right now, without some intervention, without being able to find some baby chicks that maybe somebody else has or something like that, it’s going to take us 20 months to get back to full production,” Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What could solve the issue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has long advocated for egg-laying chickens to &lt;a href="https://ktar.com/arizona-business/vaccinating-chickens-egg-prices/5664012/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;receive vaccines against bird flu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve asked our state department of agriculture … to help promote the idea of allowing use of vaccine in our flock. Let us be a test,” Hickman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, conflicting business interests from those who raise chicken for meat rather than eggs make this difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The broiler industry is adamant that they don’t want this to happen,” Hickman said. “It’s a shame that in order for one side of agriculture to prosper, the other side must suffer.”&lt;/p&gt;

The report was published on May 23, one day before Dr. Edwige Kasper, a French biologist, presented the case at the European Society of Human Genetics conference in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Sperm Bank, which supplied the sperm, confirmed that the rare variant — which Kasper’s lab concluded was likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, an inherited predisposition to cancer — was found in some of the sperm, according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;. And more than two children were affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate but simultaneous investigations revealed that the variant, found in a gene called TP53, was present in 23 total children, 10 of whom had already been diagnosed with leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other cancers, the outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though 10 kids have been diagnosed thus far, the company also confirmed that the donor’s sperm was used to conceive many more children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Sperm Bank — which recruits sperm donors in Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands, according to its &lt;a href="https://www.europeanspermbank.com/en/getting-started/about-us" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; — said that more than 67 kids were conceived using the donor’s sperm, and that all relevant fertility clinics were alerted to the situation. (It did not, however, confirm the exact number, citing a company privacy policy.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European Sperm Bank did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Sunday, May 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A stock image of frozen storage at a sperm bank&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the company, Julie Paulli Budtz, told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; the company is “deeply affected by this case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budtz also said that, even with thorough testing prior to sperm donation, “it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if testing had unearthed the mutation, it was not yet linked to cancer in 2008 (the time of the donation) and would not have been detectable through standard screening procedures, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported. The outlet also said the donor is in good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the recent diagnoses linked to a single donor, however, Kasper argues that there should be a limit on the number of births or families for a single donor instated across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking with &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, the biologist said: “We can’t do whole-genome sequencing for all sperm donors — I’m not arguing for that. But this is the abnormal dissemination of genetic disease. Not every man has 75 children across Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure is a reference to European Sperm Bank’s self-imposed limit. Reacting to calls for a limit placed on the number of children conceived with the sperm of a single donor, Budtz told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;, “We welcome continued dialogue on setting an internationally mandated family limit and have advocated for this on several occasions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is also why we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor,” Budtz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/10-kids-conceived-with-same-sperm-donor-develop-cancer-11741613" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 11:39:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBTcTZHOFBFSHRUN2RFeXVhcVJnMF85T0RhVEEwekdKV3RlZ3d3MUg5dGF3YWVWeGV5WEoyNlljU3FabnBZYlg4NmhRWkt3ODF1eUJJMlRRaWV6WXdBLTBxS0ZjY3NPV2pLMDNqcWJYYUllOXNmYnc</guid></item><item><title>这种鼻喷雾剂能减缓阿尔茨海默氏症吗？一对夫妇正在帮助科学家找出答案：镜头-健康新闻- NPR | Can this nasal spray slow down Alzheimer's?

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Joe Walsh, 79, is waiting to inhale.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's perched on a tan recliner at the Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. His wife, Karen Walsh, hovers over him, ready to depress the plunger on a nasal spray applicator.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One, two, three," a nurse counts. The plunger plunges, Walsh sniffs, and it's done.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The nasal spray contains an experimental monoclonal antibody meant to reduce the Alzheimer's-related inflammation in Walsh's brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He is the first person living with Alzheimer's to get the treatment, which is also being tested in people with diseases including multiple sclerosis, ALS and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And the drug appears to be reducing the inflammation in Walsh's brain, researchers report in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nuclear Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think this is something special," says Dr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham who helped develop the nasal spray, along with its maker, Tiziana Life Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether a decrease in inflammation will bring improvements in Walsh's thinking and memory, however, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The experimental treatment is part of a larger effort to find new ways to interrupt the cascade of events in the brain that lead to Alzheimer's dementia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two drugs now on the market clear the brain of sticky amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic protein that accumulate between neurons. Other experimental drugs have targeted the tau tangles, a different protein that builds up inside nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But fewer efforts have tried to address inflammation, a sign of Alzheimer's that becomes more pronounced as the disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-69251" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A diagnosis and a quest for care&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once Joe Walsh has finished inhaling the experimental medication, he gets a cognitive exam from Dr. Brahyan Galindo-Mendez, a neurology fellow.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Can you tell me your name please," Mendez asks. "What's your name?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a pause, Walsh answers: "Joe."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"And who is with you today?" Mendez says, glancing toward Walsh's wife, Karen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We'll do that," Walsh replies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What's her name?" Mendez persists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Her name," Walsh echoes. "That's her name. That's my wife."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Walsh is unable to put a name to the woman he's been married to for 36 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-69255" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                In 2019, a PET scan confirmed that Joe Walsh had Alzheimer's. It took Karen Walsh years to get her husband into a research study that would offer him an experimental treatment.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Karen Walsh began to notice a change in her husband back in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He was struggling to find the right words to complete a thought or a sentence," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The couple went to a primary care doctor, who said that if Walsh turned out to have Alzheimer's, he should enter a research study in hopes of getting one of the latest treatments. Then the doctor referred Walsh to a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In 2019, a PET scan revealed extensive amyloid plaques in Walsh's brain, confirming the diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As much as I was in shock," Karen Walsh says, "the words were ringing in my head: 'ask for the research.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So she began looking for a clinical trial. But in 2020, COVID arrived in the U.S., shuttering hundreds of research studies. By the time the pandemic subsided, Walsh's Alzheimer's had progressed to the point where he no longer qualified for most studies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A novel drug for inflammation&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late 2024, Karen brought Joe to Dr. Seth Gale, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham and Harvard Medical School who promised to look for a research study Walsh could enter.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Before long, Gale received a query from a colleague looking for a patient with moderate Alzheimer's disease to take part in a trial. He called the Walshes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research involved a monoclonal antibody called foralumab that was being tested on people with inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-69256" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;MS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective covering around nerve fibers, causing inflammation. And foralumab was producing promising results in MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It induces regulatory cells that go to the brain and shut down inflammation," Weiner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those regulatory cells reduce the activity of microglia, the cells that serve as the primary immune system in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Weiner thought foralumab might help with another condition that causes damaging inflammation in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've always been interested in Alzheimer's disease," Weiner says. "I lost my mother to Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most efforts to treat Alzheimer's involve clearing the brain of the disease's hallmarks: sticky amyloid plaques and tangled fibers called tau. But increasingly, researchers are seeking ways to tamp down the inflammation that accompanies those brain changes, especially as the disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once people have Alzheimer's, the inflammation is driving the disease more," Weiner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-69259" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                Dr. Howard Weiner, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham, is studying foralumab for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, COVID, ALS and Alzheimer's.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The approach worked in mice that develop a form of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in order to treat Walsh, Weiner's team had to get special permission from the Food and Drug Administration through a program called expanded access. The program is for patients who can't get into a clinical trial and have no other treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the FDA approved foralumab for Walsh, he became the first Alzheimer's patient to get the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Six months later, the drug has dramatically reduced the inflammation in Walsh's brain. But no drug can restore brain cells that have already been lost.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It will take a battery of cognitive tests to see if Walsh's memory and thinking have improved with the treatment. Karen Walsh, though, sees some positive signs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Although her husband still struggles to find words, she says, he appears to be more engaged in social activities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A couple of guys come pick him up once a month, you know, and they take him out for lunch," she says. "They sent me a text after saying, 'Wow, Joe is really, really laughing, and very involved.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-69270" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                After three months of treatment, a PET scan showed that the inflammation in Walsh's brain had decreased dramatically.

   &lt;p&gt;Walsh himself seems happy to stay on the drug. Between non sequiturs, he manages to put together a complete sentence: "It's easy enough to take it, so I do it, and it feels good."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A clinical trial of foralumab for Alzheimer's disease is scheduled to begin later this year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is known to be central to various physiological and mental processes, including the consolidation of memories, supporting various cognitive functions, helping to clear the brain of neurotoxins, balancing hormones and promoting cardiovascular health. Some recent neuroscience studies also suggest that sleep disorders, such as insomnia, periodic limb movement disorder and sleep apnea, could also be linked to hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization estimates that 1 in 3 people worldwide suffer from sleep disorders at some point in their lives. Understanding the impact of these disorders on other aspects of human experience is thus of the utmost importance, as it could inform the development of new interventions aimed at improving people's sleep patterns, as well as their health and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the link between sleep disorders and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hearing+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; has been extensively investigated, the extent to which one influences the other remains poorly understood. Some studies have proposed that hearing loss makes it harder for people to sleep well, while others suggest that sleep disorders can worsen auditory health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Air Force Medical University in China recently reviewed previous literature focusing on this topic, with the aim of painting a clearer picture of the relationship between sleep disorders and hearing loss. Their paper, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030645222500332X" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;, pin-points some of the key biological mechanisms underpinning both disrupted sleep patterns and a decline in auditory health while also offering insight that could guide the development of new treatments for sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The intricate relationship between sleep disorders and hearing loss emerges as a burgeoning field of scholarly inquiry," Peng Zhang, Xiaogang An and their colleagues wrote in their paper. "Numerous studies have illuminated a potential correlation between the two, affecting the quality of life and overall health of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Hearing loss, or auditory impairment, serves as a critical indicator of physiological dysfunction, casting a pall over the daily existence and professional endeavors of those affected, potentially leading to irreversible deafness if left untreated. Sleep disorders may cause physical and psychological changes that further affect hearing, while auditory dysfunction may detrimentally impact sleep experienced by individuals."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review of previous studies carried out by this team of researchers suggests that different stages of sleep can influence auditory perception in distinct ways. For instance, people's ability to process sounds appears to be significantly stronger during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep than during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past research also showed that hearing loss can adversely impact the quality of sleep among affected individuals. This could be because people experiencing hearing loss are often more sensitive to background noise, and this can make it harder for them to fall asleep or prompt them to wake up more often during the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, other studies showed that sleep deprivation can increase the risk of auditory impairments later in life. While the mechanisms underlying this relationship are still poorly understood, in some cases, successfully treating sleep disorders could also promote better auditory health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although certain studies have failed to find a direct link between sleep duration and hearing loss, it is evident that sleep-related issues do increase the risk of hearing loss," wrote Zhang, An and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"Thus, understanding the relationship between sleep disorders and hearing loss, alongside the underlying mechanisms, will help establish interventions aimed at enhancing sleep quality and safeguarding auditory health. This systematic review endeavors to elucidate the correlation between sleep disorders and hearing loss, offering valuable insights and guidance for future basic research and clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review paper by this team of researchers summarizes some of the most notable findings gathered over the past decades, outlining the robust correlation between sleep disruptions and a decline in hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, this study could guide further targeted investigations aimed at better understanding the neural and biological mechanisms linking these two seemingly unrelated experiences, which could potentially help to devise new personalized treatments for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sleep+disorders/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sleep disorders&lt;/a&gt; or initiatives aimed at preventing or mitigating hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; this week that he was rescinding the federal government’s recommendation that pregnant women and healthy children get immunized against COVID, effective immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marty Makary, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also said the agency will no longer routinely approve annually formulated COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy people under age 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We simply don’t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had COVID-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,” Makary, along with another FDA official, Dr. Vinay Prasad, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;in the New England Journal of Medicine this month. “This policy will compel much-needed evidence generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some experts say mandating more extensive testing could delay vaccine access for many, as those efforts may not even be complete until after the end of the upcoming winter flu-and-COVID season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that, in general, getting an updated vaccine provides children and adults &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/WX8rfa_f5o0?t=5503s" target="_blank"&gt;additional protection&lt;/a&gt; from COVID-related emergency room and urgent care visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent federal changes, according to some experts, could also prompt private insurance companies and government insurers to stop paying for COVID shots for wide segments of the population, including babies and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent a recommendation by federal officials, Americans could end up paying the entire cost of a vaccine, experts say. The out-of-pocket cost for a COVID vaccine at CVS, for instance, is $198.99. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-02-28/do-not-post-californias-covid-emergency-is-over-now-what"&gt;emergency phase of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; has long since passed, authorities note COVID remains a public health concern. A relatively new subvariant has been spreading in Europe and Asia, “particularly Hong Kong, Taiwan, other countries, Japan, etc.,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That subvariant, NB.1.8.1, was first documented in January and has since been detected in California, including in Los Angeles County and the San Francisco Bay Area. The World Health Organization &lt;a class="link" href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/variants?n=o" target="_blank"&gt;designated&lt;/a&gt; it a “Variant Under Monitoring” last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has grown exponentially worldwide in recent weeks. The Omicron subvariant represented 10.7% of genetically analyzed viral samples worldwide for the week ending April 27, WHO data show. That was up sharply from the week ending April 6, when the subvariant &lt;a class="link" href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=7b14df58_4" target="_blank"&gt;accounted for&lt;/a&gt; 2.5% of samples worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While still low numbers, this is a significant rise,” the WHO said, adding that there was a “concurrent increase in cases and hospitalizations in some countries where NB.1.8.1 is widespread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 isn’t yet prevalent enough in the United States to be &lt;a class="link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" target="_blank"&gt;publicly tracked&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC. Another strain, LP.8.1,  accounted for an estimated 73% of coronavirus specimens nationally for the two-week period ending Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data suggest NB.1.8.1 does not cause more severe illness, “but it is more transmissible, at least from what we’re seeing around the world and also from lab experiments,” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease expert at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, a top health official told reporters that an NB.1.8.1-fueled outbreak was “continuing to rise rapidly, with a sustained increase in severe and fatal cases,” the Central News Agency &lt;a class="link" href="https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202505270017" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a shortage of COVID testing kits. Health officials said a factor in Taiwan’s surge was the lack of a major COVID wave over the winter, and forecast that the island’s current spike may not peak for another four to six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has seen increased prevalence in each of the three WHO regions that still consistently share genetic analysis of COVID samples — the Western Pacific (which includes East Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, and Australia); Europe; and the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID tests are coming back positive in Los Angeles County has slightly increased over the past few weeks, although the overall positive rate remains low, at 3.5%, according to the county Department of Public Health. Coronavirus levels detected in the county’s wastewater have increased by 6% in the last three weeks, but also remain relatively low and are about one-eighth of the peak in the summer of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although California experienced a mild winter season — a first of the COVID era — that followed a powerful &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-08-12/why-is-covid-still-surging-in-california-a-midsummer-mutation-may-be-to-blame"&gt;summer spike&lt;/a&gt; that was the strongest in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many experts and officials have touted available COVID vaccines as effective both in warding off infection and in lessening the severity of symptoms. However, the need for otherwise healthy individuals to roll up their sleeves has been a matter of debate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;video message&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday on X, Kennedy — a noted vaccine skeptic — said that he “couldn’t be more pleased to announce that, as of today, the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said they could not recall a time when a political appointee circumvented a well-established process of making vaccine recommendations, which typically involves panels of scientists advising the FDA and CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s kind of chilling,” Chin-Hong said. “It’s out of step with the system we’ve learned to trust and follow.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to The Times, the L.A. County Department of Public Health urged Kennedy to listen to experts in the field — including from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which is scheduled to meet next month — “before decreasing access to any vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Thursday, the CDC still had the long-standing vaccine recommendations on its website:  Everyone ages 6 months and older should get the most recent COVID-19 vaccine, officially known as the 2024-25 version, which was introduced in September. The CDC also recommends seniors ages 65 and up get a second vaccine dose six months after their first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the California Department of Public Health said that it supports the current expansive recommendation for COVID vaccines, and that it “will continue to follow the federal conversation through this dynamic situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination can reduce the risk of disease, especially more severe cases that result in hospitalization or death,” the department added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington Post &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/28/vaccines-cdc-rfk-jr-covid/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that the CDC did not know of Kennedy’s directive until he posted it, and officials have been “scrambling to find out what it meant.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who spoke with The Times warned the practical effect of the edict — if it becomes official — could be far more costly vaccines for affected groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If vaccines are not recommended by the CDC, insurance companies would NOT be required to cover the cost,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the vaccines may be less accessible to healthier people who still want them — perhaps because they live or work with elderly or other higher-risk people, they’ve had severe COVID illness before, or they want to protect themselves against the latest subvariant, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the FDA withholds a license for an updated COVID vaccination for younger, healthier adults, this group “would not be able to receive it unless their provider chooses to give it ‘off label,’” the county said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether healthy pregnant women and healthy children can still get vaccinated at its pharmacies, Walgreens said its teams operate “in full compliance with applicable laws.” CVS said its locations “follow federal guidance regarding vaccine administration and are monitoring any changes that the government may make regarding vaccine eligibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente Southern California said it was aware of potential changes, but noted no new formal guidance has yet been issued. As a result, Kaiser is continuing to follow existing guidance, which recommends the shots for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The L.A. County Department of Public Health said that as of Wednesday, “pregnant women and healthy children can get vaccinated for COVID-19,” according to existing  recommendations from an advisory panel and the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted there were 150 pediatric deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 in a recent one-year period. That’s in the same ballpark as the 231 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-20.html" target="_blank"&gt;pediatric flu deaths&lt;/a&gt; recorded this season, and federal health officials recommend everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual flu shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people would agree that kids should be targeted for flu vaccines. It seems kind of weird to have COVID as an outlier in that respect,” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video published this week, Makary said that “most countries in the world have stopped recommending the vaccine for children.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maldonado, however, said the U.S. doesn’t use other nations’ standards to dictate vaccine recommendations. The U.S., for instance, recommends other types of vaccines that have a lower prevalence than COVID that people want to get, Maldonado said, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;meningococcal vaccine&lt;/a&gt; for children to guard against a serious &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;bacterial disease&lt;/a&gt; that can infect the brain and spinal cord and cause death within hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of a recommendation also varies by country. Canada, for instance, recommends updated COVID vaccines for seniors and other people who meet certain criteria, such as if they’re pregnant or are a healthcare worker. But the country’s universal healthcare system still allows everyone ages 6 months and older to get an updated COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s true that children overall are at lower risk of developing severe COVID illness, those under 6 months of age “have the same risk of complications as the 65-year-old-plus population in this country,” said Stanford’s Maldonado, who also serves on the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among children eligible for vaccination, COVID-associated hospitalization rates are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/03-Havers-COVID-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; for those ages 6 months to 4 years, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So are children going to be the highest risk group? No, they’re not. But would you want to protect your child from a disease that could potentially put them in the hospital and get them on a ventilator? Yes, I would say that I would want to make that choice for myself. And why not allow the parent to make that choice?” Maldonado said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC says COVID vaccination during pregnancy builds antibodies that can help protect the baby; studies have also shown that vaccinated moms who breastfeed have protective  antibodies in their milk, which could help protect their babies.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been an estimated 260,000 to 430,000 &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/burden-estimates.html" target="_blank"&gt;hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; attributed to COVID since October, causing “an enormous burden on the healthcare system,” Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist with the CDC, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/WX8rfa_f5o0?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=4113" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at a recent public meeting. There have also been an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 COVID-19 deaths over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adults, but it does affect other people, particularly those with underlying conditions, in younger age groups.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID is also a major cause of pediatric hospitalizations, even among otherwise healthy children, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there’s a summer wave this year, we’ll be seeing it in children being hospitalized with COVID as well,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOdXpTaGVINk01eEdSMGF2R1pUaWlqeTRPcXBrQ1h5MUlEdmlBWHlYRTA5MW5jSk4zV3F0TW1uWm91eVVvcUR5QmdvcTE3ZWEzVllha0VENkF6TFVuWmo5Zy00eHRJOEFFQ1k2aUVudWZ2Ukp1aTJMam8zOFdrSjBGVC1uZHBxVmFmdEdiZ2xwRUotc3Q5Z1RJVnE0QnRRWk5ZT1djeF9VcWNYYXQwelpCUEYtTkcxZVRsVDBWV2FZUVRSOFE</guid></item><item><title>威斯康星州医生提出野生麻疹索赔- EXPOSEDbyCMD | Wisconsin Doctor Makes Wild Measles Claims - EXPOSEDbyCMD</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPWXJ4blRRMXYyUUdGRzRuZE85MnpxRWp2X09XejNiWDdSRXdkQ3pCTXYtdjhtUFdLTWxidmtRUWRNNlR1bUJYWWVzaTVrR2FnaVh4RkZSblhodnFfX2NiVEtfMWRVWkJYc05HQzNpUWxNanhTdUFPYW9BM3pHVFZSZ0Z4SGxRaEhiQjk4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece is published in partnership with the &lt;a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2025/05/30/wisconsin-doctor-makes-wild-measles-claims/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Wisconsin Examiner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary and longtime anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral for the second unvaccinated child in Texas to have died in the &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-surpasses-1000-measles-cases-1st-time-5/story?id=121635906" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;ongoing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;. While in Texas, he met with the two grieving families — along with two local doctors promoting unproven measles treatments, whom he called “&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/measles-spreading-rfk-jr-praising-205736643.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;extraordinary healers&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the first death, Children’s Health Defense (CHD), the anti-vax organization Kennedy led until recently, pushed its own narrative claiming that the 6-year-old Mennonite girl did not actually die from the measles. In this effort, CHD has relied heavily on &lt;a href="https://whowhatwhy.org/politics/us-politics/ivermectin-dr-pierre-kory-and-the-wonder-drug-that-wasnt/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Pierre Kory&lt;/a&gt;, a Wisconsin doctor who has both amplified that assertion and claimed that the measles virus has been weaponized by unknown conspirators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kory is a Kennedy ally who has been widely criticized for spreading Covid &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/02/21/covid-misinformation-earnings/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, including pushing the use of ivermectin as a “&lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/Testimony-Kory-2020-12-08.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;miracle drug&lt;/a&gt;” for treating that virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, CHD and Kennedy have promoted the debunked claim that the standard measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine given to almost all children in the U.S. is tied to autism. With an upsurge in the pandemic-era, right-wing embrace of the anti-vax movement — and of Kennedy himself — there has been a notable &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;decrease in routine pediatric vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that measles immunization rates have fallen below thresholds to maintain herd immunity in certain parts of the country, outbreaks such as the one in West Texas are expected to become more common. In February, Texas reported the country’s first measles death in a child in the &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/child-dies-of-measles-heres-a-look-at-the-countrys-re-emerging-disease" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than two decades&lt;/a&gt; since the disease was classified as eradicated in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to this death, CHD posted a &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/breaking-news-doctors-review-texas-measles-medical-records/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; on March 19 featuring Kory and Ben Edwards, another Texas doctor Kennedy applauded, discussing the girl’s medical records, which her parents released to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having no training in pediatric medicine and having had his board certifications in internal medicine and critical care &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/13/doctors-accused-spreading-misinformation-lose-certifications/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; last year, Kory &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/medical-error-death-6-year-old-girl-pneumonia-after-measles/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; the child’s death was due to incorrect antibiotic management of a bacterial pneumonia infection that had “little to do with measles.” Edwards — a family doctor who has been treating measles-stricken children in Texas with medications &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;not indicated for measles&lt;/a&gt; and was accused of seeing pediatric patients while &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/video-shows-doctor-measles-treating-kids-rfk-jr-120958393" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;actively infected&lt;/a&gt; with measles himself — concurred with Kory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without being able to examine the medical records themselves, pediatricians consulted for this article were limited in their critique of Kory’s assessment. But they did question his understanding of empiric antibiotic &lt;a href="https://www.childrensmn.org/references/cds/community-acquired-pneumonia-guidelines.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for pediatric pneumonia. Secondary bacterial pneumonia infections following viral diseases are common, and pneumonia is a well-documented complication of a measles infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These doctors also questioned the strong personal bias underpinning Kory’s assessment and pointed to his history of extreme claims about Covid made online and to right-wing media outlets  as evidence against his reliability as an “expert.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Kory has been inconsistent in his messaging around this measles death when addressing various audiences. When Alex Morozov, founder of the counter-misinformation group Eviva Partners, &lt;a href="https://alexmorozovny.substack.com/p/real-story-of-the-measles-case-vibrating" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;confronted Kory&lt;/a&gt; about his statements regarding the young girl’s cause of death at the so-called “Summit for Truth &amp;amp; Wellness” on March 29, the answer he got was very different. At that event, Kory suggested this was a case of the measles being “weaponized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://alexmorozovny.substack.com/p/secretary-kennedys-inner-circle" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;audio recording&lt;/a&gt; of their conversation published by Morozov, Kory said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to know the real story on this case? Quite a few of us believe that they weaponized the measles virus. And this measles is more. They’re doing this on purpose. She got sicker from the measles probably because they monkeyed with the measles virus…. Do you know how many bioweapons labs there are and what they can do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the unfounded claim of an error in medical treatment, this “weaponized measles” narrative has spread rapidly throughout the online crankosphere. However, this conspiratorial rhetoric has not been accompanied by urgent recommendations for increased vaccinations to prevent infection from a supposedly more virulent strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who promoted pandemic conspiracy theories along with ivermectin as an alternative to Covid vaccines, has called Kory “&lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1677307834608889856?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;honest, brave, and sincere&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1810444249701187706?lang=en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;a brave dissident doctor&lt;/a&gt;.” The doctor appeared with him at various campaign-related events in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, both before and after RFK Jr. suspended his own campaign and joined forces with Trump to launch the “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ivermectin proved to be ineffective against Covid, Kory turned on the &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;life-saving&lt;/a&gt; mRNA vaccines while cozying up to Kennedy and CHD. Kory and the ivermectin group he co-founded — the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), now called the &lt;a href="https://www.importantcontext.news/p/ivermectin-doctors-rebrand-and-rally" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;Independent Medical Alliance&lt;/a&gt; following a pro-MAHA rebrand — have rallied with Kennedy and CHD on multiple occasions, including against Covid vaccine mandates during the deadly Omicron wave in late 2021 and early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kory has not just turned on Covid vaccines, but routine childhood immunizations in line with Kennedy’s and CHD’s established anti-vax rhetoric as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Kory appeared in an FLCCC &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/your-child-your-choice-vaccines-treatment-decisions/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt; about pediatric vaccines titled “Your Child, Your Choice.” The same year, despite his lack of pediatric credentials, he served as an “expert” on the issue of childhood vaccinations for Republicans in Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That same year, Kory testified at the Wisconsin Capitol as part of a GOP-led &lt;a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/new-student-vaccination-mandates-wisconsin-gop-block" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;effort&lt;/a&gt; to block adding the meningitis vaccine as a state requirement for school-aged children, which is  required in many other states and has been recommended by the Center for Disease Control’s Advisory Council on Immunization Practices since 2005. (While Kory and company were initially successful, the meningitis vaccine was eventually added to Wisconsin’s requirements as of the 2023/24 school year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this measles outbreak, both Kennedy and Kory have once again promoted “alternative” treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has drawn heavy criticism for pushing &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; as a treatment for measles while simultaneously failing to provide a sorely needed, full-throated endorsement of the MMR vaccines. Following the second death, while the HHS secretary correctly called the vaccines the “most effective way” to prevent measles, he quickly undermined his own statement. In his tweet about the funeral, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/06/measles-texas-death-outbreak-vaccine/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; a shoutout to doctors Edwards and Richard Bartlett, his other “extraordinary healer” from Texas, for their use of unproven treatments on infected children in the local community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 31, Kory appeared in another CHD &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/reviewing-the-medical-records-in-texas-measles-death/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; about the first Texas child’s death, claiming she should have received intravenous vitamin C, which is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/tropej/article-abstract/52/4/302/1621727?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;not indicated&lt;/a&gt; for measles-related pneumonia. Of note, prior to his co-authorship of &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.10.23293924v2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;questionable papers&lt;/a&gt; on the use of ivermectin to fight Covid, Kory co-authored a &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2021/11/09/bad-math-covid-treatment-paper-by-pierre-kory-retracted-for-flawed-results/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;since-retracted paper&lt;/a&gt; on a Covid hospital protocol that featured vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given his past statements on Covid and routine pediatric vaccines as well as his ties to Kennedy and CHD, Kory would have a vested interest in distancing himself from children’s deaths from vaccine-preventable illness. But this is dangerous, experts warn, during a measles outbreak where vaccines play a vital role in stopping the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for the hospital that treated the first child &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/anti-vaccine-influencers-weaponized-measles-death-texas-rcna196900" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;spoke out&lt;/a&gt; against “misleading and inaccurate claims” about this case being circulated online. “Our physicians and care teams follow evidence-based protocols and make clinical decisions based on a patient’s evolving condition, diagnostic findings, and the best available medical knowledge,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHD did not back down in the wake of the second pediatric measles death early last month. The organization &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/texas-8-year-old-died-measles-pulmonary-failure-chd-requests-medical-records/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;requested hospital records&lt;/a&gt; for this case while offering a free e-book — featuring a foreword by Kennedy — on “secrets the government and media aren’t telling you about measles and the measles vaccine.” The book &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/ebook-sign-up/the-measles-book/?itm_term=homehero" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;accuses&lt;/a&gt; the mainstream media of weaponizing outbreaks “for political gain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://support.childrenshealthdefense.org/site/MessageViewer;jsessionid=00000000.app30024b?dlv_id=27004&amp;amp;em_id=28082.0&amp;amp;NONCE_TOKEN=1506C8DF0C617881D19237C29258439A" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; to their followers on April 7 — the day after the second child’s funeral — CHD announced an April 17 webinar event called “Inside the Measles Deception” featuring Kory, Booker, and Edwards. The restricted event was available only to their donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 8, CHD &lt;a href="https://x.com/ChildrensHD/status/1909610036214587742" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “Our mission hasn’t changed. The MMR vaccine is dangerous and has caused more deaths than measles,” a claim that is totally unsubstantiated. The next day, Kory returned for &lt;a href="https://live.childrenshealthdefense.org/chd-tv/shows/good-morning-chd/second-measles-death-confirmed-not-from-measles-lessons-from-the-passage-of/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"&gt;another CHD video&lt;/a&gt; claiming to have reviewed the medical records for the second case and, unsurprisingly, again maintained that the 8-year-old girl did not die from the measles. He said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just getting exhausting, this constant fear-mongering by the media. I’ve already lost so much trust in the institutions of society. But to see them rampage like this on inaccuracies and peddling falsehoods and just distortions, it’s terrible. It’s terrible for our health. They are scaring people into getting what I think is a very dangerous vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EXPOSEDbyCMD</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPWXJ4blRRMXYyUUdGRzRuZE85MnpxRWp2X09XejNiWDdSRXdkQ3pCTXYtdjhtUFdLTWxidmtRUWRNNlR1bUJYWWVzaTVrR2FnaVh4RkZSblhodnFfX2NiVEtfMWRVWkJYc05HQzNpUWxNanhTdUFPYW9BM3pHVFZSZ0Z4SGxRaEhiQjk4</guid></item><item><title>导致危险性肝损伤的1号补充剂，医生警告- bestlifeonline.com | The No. 1 Supplement Causing Dangerous Liver Damage, Doctors Warn - bestlifeonline.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTFBKTDdGazM3S2xHLUdvVWFpYkdUcHl5U1d3Z2hHazdCTmVPMmliNEFsZDhIelJSTE82TTZBQ3B2UW9DS2t5ZEZYTHZtYU1GbEQzTG52WndHdkFLM1ZRYklPZ3NtbWo3bDFFMl9SX0FB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-modal-body" id="sTop_Bar_0_0_23_0_0_13_1"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 86 65" fill="none"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_10068_937)"&gt;&lt;path d="M83.0003 61.8788V2.99927H3.00058V61.8788H83.0003Z" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M3.74396 3.74927L38.2558 38.7207C40.8139 41.2985 45.4686 41.268 47.9726 38.7442L82.4608 4.03073" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M4.92966 59.9398L31.3724 32.9077" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M80.7678 59.6279L55.038 33.2822" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_10068_937"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;h3 class="newsletter-modal__headline"&gt;Best Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text-medium"&gt;

In just under 23 hours on 3 September 2021, Sean Greasley climbed and descended 8,849 m (29,032ft) – a distance that would have taken him to the top of the highest mountain on Earth. By the end, he was dripping in sweat and could &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grk-1qipf-8" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;barely walk&lt;/a&gt;.

Tower running, for example, involves racing up enormous flights of stairs inside iconic buildings and skyscrapers. There is even a Tower Running Association and an official tower running &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.towerrunning.com/ranking/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;global ranking&lt;/a&gt; for the elite athletes dedicated to this unusual sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most of us are unlikely to achieve such giddy heights, yet even climbing a few flights of stairs in our daily lives might be something to aspire to. According to research, climbing stairs can have surprising benefits for both &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021915023052218" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;your physical health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-024-00294-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;your brain&lt;/a&gt; without needing to hurtle up two steps at a time or break records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's this everyday simplicity that is stair-climbing's greatest strength. Stairs are everywhere – we encounter them at home, at work and in public. Choosing to take the stairs instead of hopping on an escalator or riding in a lift provides us with an incidental form of exercise that can have an outsized impact on our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It's an exercise that nearly everybody can perform because they have access, and they do it on the daily basis," says Alexis Marcotte-Chenard, a postdoctoral research fellow in heart, lung and vascular health at the University of British Columbia in Kelowna, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Marcotte-Chenard has been researching how to use exercise and nutrition to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, including the effects of "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34669625/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;exercise snacks&lt;/a&gt;" – brief, spaced-out periods of vigorous activity lasting one minute or less that are performed throughout the day.

Researchers have found that stair-climbing results in surprising improvements in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50282-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cognitive ability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Andreas Stenling is an associate professor psychology at Umeå University, Sweden, who primarily researches the longer-term relationships between physical activity and health. He and his colleagues studied the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41465-024-00294-1#Sec17" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;immediate effects&lt;/a&gt; of stair-climbing on different cognitive abilities in young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Inhibition and switching were the two main cognitive functions we focused on here," says Stenling, "Cognitive switching, sometimes called mental flexibility, is how easy we're able to switch between cognitive tasks," he says. "So, going from one task to the other without having to reset your cognition, so to speak. Inhibition is about blocking out irrelevant information while you're engaged in the task." Stenling explains that we know that these cognitive functions are important for learning, cognitive word tasks, abstract thinking, and being able to keep your thoughts on one thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Climbing more than five flights of stairs daily  is associated with a lower risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Stenling and colleagues found that their stair-climbing exercise significantly improved participants' "switching" abilities, which is also considered the most difficult of the cognitive tasks tested for. They also tested for changes in mood, finding that participants felt happier and more energetic after stair-climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another study published by researchers at the Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50282-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Japan also found that people who climbed two flights of stairs displayed&lt;/a&gt; more focused problem solving than those who took the elevator. Intriguingly, there weren't any improvements in problem solving when they climbed five or eight flights of stairs, suggesting the effect is not dependent upon the number of stairs. Another study by the same group also found that walking downstairs led to an &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2021.834097/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;increase in creative thinking&lt;/a&gt;, generating 61% more original ideas than those who travelled using a lift. So if you are looking for a burst of inspiration on a problem you are trying to solve, a quick jaunt up to the next floor and back may be all you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There is much interest in the mechanisms which link exercise to cognitive benefits, but little conclusive research. Stenling suggests, however, that the improvements could be linked to the cardiovascular system and the increase in blood flow to the brain, as well as growth hormones such as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/15092" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor&lt;/a&gt; (BDNF), which seem to be impacted quickly by exercise in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers including Stenling are also keen to explore whether there may be any delayed effects from stair climbing. Most studies focus on the cognitive effects immediately after climbing some stairs. One recent study found, however, that there were &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-024-01683-7" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;some improvements in memory&lt;/a&gt; from stair-climbing that carry over to the next day when paired with good sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But while the concept of taking 10,000 steps a day is ingrained in the public mind as the benchmark for daily exercise, is there a similar target we should be aiming for when it comes to stairs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lf999d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Many of us climb stairs as an incidental part of our day, so it can be an easy way to gain health benefits (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Many of us climb stairs as an incidental part of our day, so it can be an easy way to gain health benefits (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The research is similarly sparse when it comes to putting a target on stair climbing. But the studies that do exist suggest that climbing more than five flights of stairs daily (equivalent to 50 steps) is associated with a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(23)05221-8/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lower risk&lt;/a&gt; of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is the build-up of plaque in the arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Marcotte-Chenard and his colleagues are optimistic that exercise snacks, specifically stair-climbing, could provide a good solution to breaking sedimentary habits at work. In a study assessing the psychological responses of office employees undertaking stair-climbing in the workplace, Marcotte-Chenard and colleagues found that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37748202/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;71% of employees&lt;/a&gt; preferred several small exercise snacks, climbing 60 steps in three different sessions, over one intense HIIT (high intensity interval training) session of climbing 60 steps three times in one session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For them [the participants], it's easier to just go one time up and down the stairs and go back to sitting," says Marcotte-Chenard. "And because you spread it out throughout the day, it seems that people enjoy it a little bit more than if they do it in one single session." The researchers' study is unique for being conducted outside the laboratory, which could suggest that the research is more applicable to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Not all research agrees that home stair-climbing is the answer, with some suggesting it is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcsm.12679" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;insufficient physical&lt;/a&gt; activity to lower the risk of CVD mortality and premature death.

Although the weather in Milwaukie, Ore., was cold and rainy that March evening, his apartment was too warm to explain his chills. He had been having abdominal pain for the past several weeks, but that night it was excruciating — like a knife plunged deep into his belly, sharp and burning. All the strength seemed to seep from his body, and he thought he might pass out. That’s when he asked his roommate to call 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The E.M.T.s were concerned by the man’s pallor and low blood pressure and took him to Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside in Clackamas, just north of the small town where he spent much of his childhood. In the E.R., initial blood tests showed that he had lost a tremendous amount of blood — nearly half the blood in his system. The man shook with cold beneath the several blankets layered over him. With trembling hands, he signed the consent forms for a transfusion to replace some of what he had lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-72d7d2a"&gt;Months of Bizarre Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It had been a strange winter. In January, he noticed a bulge in the left side of his abdomen while taking a shower. He pressed on it, and it disappeared, only to reappear when the pressure was released. It didn’t hurt, but it was weird and new. He got in to see a physician assistant 10 days later. The P.A. couldn’t see or feel the lump but ordered an ultrasound to look for it. And they found it: a mass the size of a large grapefruit, about six inches in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Three weeks later, before any follow-ups had been planned, the man was sent a Valentine’s Day lunch by his girlfriend. He had just started eating when he developed a stabbing pain in his abdomen. It lasted less than a minute. But every mouthful after that moment triggered the same searing pain — even water. He drove himself to a nearby urgent care center. A CT scan showed clearly that the grapefruit of fluid now filled his entire upper abdomen, compressing his stomach, pancreas and spleen. He was admitted to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Before Dr. Amit Sadana, the gastroenterologist assigned to his care, met the patient the following day, he had already reviewed the images showing the mass. It was probably digestive enzymes leaking from the pancreas into the abdomen. The man’s body had responded by walling off the fluid with inflammatory cells, forming what is called a pseudocyst. This was usually seen after trauma — often a serious car accident in which the seatbelt was slammed against the abdomen. The man recalled an accidental hit sustained while wrestling in the snow with a friend a couple of months earlier. Sadana looked dubious — it usually took more force than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In any case, the doctor said, he could put a tube into the pseudocyst and let the fluid flow into the man’s stomach. That would reduce the pressure and allow the inflammatory mass to resolve. That was done the next day, and for the first time in weeks, the young man was able to eat and drink with no pain. He was sent home a day later; the plan was to let the fluid drain for three or four weeks and then remove the tube. Sadana sent the fluid to the lab to see if there was something else going on. The results showed no evidence of cancer. Pancreatic cancer is rare in someone this young, but it could cause a leak of pancreatic fluid. And it’s not a diagnosis you want to miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pair of French scientists are exploring the impact of ionizing radiation on pollinators. Their research has taken them to Fukushima, Japan, site of the infamous 2011 nuclear disaster, to investigate how radioactivity might affect the cognitive abilities of these insects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Drives This Research?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, it’s important to recognize that pollinators like bees and hornets possess &lt;strong&gt;numerous cognitive abilities&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling them, for example, to navigate space or recognize colors. However, we know that environmental pollution and other human-made substances can disrupt the cognition of these insects. So, what about radioactivity? This topic was explored in an article published by CNRS Le Journal on May 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magazine spoke with Olivier Armant from the Ecology and Ecotoxicology of Radionuclides lab at the Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection Authority (ASNR) and Mathieu Lihoreau, an ethologist at the Animal Cognition Research Center (CRCA) of the Toulouse Integrative Biology Center (CBI). Armant is investigating the &lt;strong&gt;ecological effects of ionizing rays&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly on the wildlife and plant life in the contaminated Fukushima area in Japan. Lihoreau, on the other hand, is deeply interested in bee intelligence and the factors that could impair it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two researchers are now collaborating with Japan, using a system developed with the Toulouse-based startup BeeGuard (described below). This involves a concept of a connected hive that allows for &lt;strong&gt;real-time monitoring of the biological activity&lt;/strong&gt; of certain bee species in a radioactive environment. For the scientists, these studies could shed light on bees’ learning and memory capacities and could also be &lt;strong&gt;valuable in ecotoxicology&lt;/strong&gt;. According to Mathieu Lihoreau, &lt;em&gt;“if bees exhibit learning deficits in certain areas, it indicates a problem.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initial Findings Are Not Encouraging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists believe that &lt;strong&gt;radioactive residues present in nectar&lt;/strong&gt; could impair bees’ cognitive abilities. For instance, the insects might be unable to associate a reward with a color (or scent). Consequently, they might visit flowers of various species instead of focusing on one, thus failing to deliver the correct pollen to the appropriate plants. Over the long term, this could jeopardize the survival of the colonies and, more broadly, the &lt;strong&gt;pollination service crucial to the balance of ecosystems&lt;/strong&gt;. While this remains a hypothesis, similar conclusions exist concerning certain pesticide-laden areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several tests in the Toulouse region, the connected hive was deployed in Fukushima’s contaminated zone as part of &lt;strong&gt;two field operations in 2023 and 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. The sites were selected based on the soil contamination levels with cesium 137, and local hornets were also included in the cognition study. In the hive, there’s a Y-shaped maze with two paths lit by LEDs of different colors. However, only one of the colors leads to a reward, namely sweet water. According to experts, a healthy bee &lt;strong&gt;needs about ten attempts&lt;/strong&gt; to find the correct path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while the study’s results have not yet been published in a scientific journal, the two French researchers are already concerned. Indeed, they have reported &lt;strong&gt;a decline in cognitive performance&lt;/strong&gt; in Fukushima’s contaminated zone. However, although correlations exist, there’s currently no proof of a causal link involving radioactive contamination. Moreover, since the area is now uninhabited, this decline in cognition cannot be attributed to the presence of pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

It seems like everyone is pushing it these days. It's true that our bodies need protein to function, but how much is really necessary and is it possible to go overboard? We asked a doctor and a registered dietitian for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, protein is a chain of amino acids that every cell in your body needs to do its job. “&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002467.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; is the main building block for our body,” says &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/zhaoping-li" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zhaoping Li, M.D., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Zhaoping Li, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition and the chief of the Division of Clinical Nutrition at the &lt;a href="https://medschool.ucla.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of protein are seemingly endless. “&lt;strong&gt;Your body uses protein to repair and build muscle tissue, and it's also part of the structure of your bones, cartilage, skin and blood&lt;/strong&gt;,” says &lt;a href="https://samanthacassetty.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Samantha Cassetty, M.S., R.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, M.S., R.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition and wellness expert, the founder of Sam’s Plate and co-author of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sugar-Shock-Hidden-Smart-Swaps/dp/1950785009/?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C10055.a.64853473%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sugar Shock;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Sugar Shock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. “It also helps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413120303119" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:produce immune cells;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;produce immune cells&lt;/a&gt; that fight infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein, carbohydrates and fats are &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/a37305530/macronutrients-and-micronutrients/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the three macronutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;the three macronutrients&lt;/a&gt; our bodies depend on. However, unlike carbohydrates and fats, protein is not stored in the body, notes Dr. Li. “We have limited protein reserve for a few hours to support our organ system metabolism,” she says. That means we have to eat protein every day to ensure our body has what it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much protein do we need?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It gets a little tricky because there’s not a one-size-fits-all number,” says Cassetty. The &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/protein-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends that women consume 5 to 6.5 ounces of protein foods every day, while men eat 5.5 to 7 ounces daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A general rule of thumb is to eat.8 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight every day.&lt;/strong&gt; (That would be about 54 grams for a 150-pound woman.) “Most Americans meet that, but that recommendation is based on the minimum amount needed to prevent deficiency and maintain basic functions — not necessarily the optimal amount to thrive,” says Cassetty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most experts agree that a higher intake — around 1.2 to 2 grams per kilogram of body weight (that's 82-136 grams for a 150-pound woman)— may be better&lt;/strong&gt; for maintaining muscle mass, managing weight and supporting healthy aging,” Cassetty explains. “Your exact needs depend on things like your age, activity level and goals, but most people would benefit from getting a bit more than the bare minimum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat too much protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is an upper limit, especially for folks with abnormal kidney function,” says Dr. Li. “But it is generally safe for healthy individuals.” In fact, she says, certain groups of people such as those who have an acute illness, are athletes or are elderly may need more than the general recommendations. &lt;strong&gt;To figure out the ideal amounts for your body, “it is important to see a &lt;a href="https://nbpns.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Physician Nutrition Specialist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Physician Nutrition Specialist&lt;/a&gt; or/and &lt;a href="https://www.eatright.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:registered dietitian;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;registered dietitian&lt;/a&gt;,”&lt;/strong&gt; adds Dr. Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember, maintaining a balanced diet is key, even if you’re on a quest for more protein. “I often see people loading up on protein in ways that crowd out other essential nutrients — especially fiber from plant foods,” says Cassetty. “While protein has many benefits, it’s just one piece of a balanced diet. More than &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:90% of Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;90% of Americans&lt;/a&gt; fall short on fiber, so it’s important to zoom out and look at the bigger picture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the best sources of protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassetty recommends starting with whole foods before reaching for highly processed protein bars and shakes. “You can get it from both animal and plant sources like chicken, fish, eggs, tofu and pulses (such as beans and lentils),” she says. “Some of my go-to easy options include Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, eggs, canned or pouched tuna and salmon, steamed lentils, frozen edamame and canned chickpeas. Frozen shrimp is great, too — it defrosts quickly and cooks fast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a pinch, she says foods like &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/fitness/g28089471/best-protein-powder/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein powder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt;, frozen veggie burgers, canned lentil soup and edamame or chickpea pasta can provide protein, but it’s best not to make them everyday staples. “All foods can fit, but they don’t fit equally,” says Cassetty. “Prioritizing whole food sources of protein is a better way to go for your long-term health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 05:14:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOSWJVNFhnTGRWSmZIZzU2eVR1N2NjTUViYkJVZ3FraFBVcjZfMWFWV25VQ1FreWdLODIyaXdIY1FidVhoal9tT3RtX0pmYUpfenZLVUpXNUNFWHZqaG5EOW5VOHd6TUpKU0xoSTVsTEc2Z2pWS3BQa1AxRzM5cTNYNzBtOUFRSE9N</guid></item><item><title>专家精确指出对您的健康最关键的十年......当伤害无法挽回时-每日邮报 | Experts pinpoint the most critical decade for your health... when damage can't be undone - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have pinpointed the most important decade for your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking, drinking, and being inactive &lt;span&gt;become entrenched in the decade between 36 and 46 and are harder to reverse, according to a new study. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each year a person continues an unhealthy habit, the damage is compounded, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These habits gradually erode a person's metabolic and psychological health until they become part of a person's biology after 46. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study out of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/finland/index.html" id="mol-ef39fe90-3cc3-11f0-adc7-311d266abbd3"&gt;Finland&lt;/a&gt; showed that when a person reaches 30, each additional decade of risky behavior worsened their health through age 50 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Even a single risky behaviour increases the risk of premature death and diseases, but together with other health behaviours, the impact is cumulative,’ the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Furthermore, the impact of these behaviours on health accumulates throughout a lifetime.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who smoked, drank, and were physically inactive through their 20s saw few negative effects then, but those behaviors caught up with them, causing &lt;span&gt;worse mental health, poorer self-rated health, and doubled metabolic risks such as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13992723/Half-Americans-silent-killer-condition-CDC-warns.html"&gt; high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, obesity, or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-ef32d2a0-3cc3-11f0-adc7-311d266abbd3" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; by age their late-30s. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;People who start engaging in risky behaviors young, such as smoking, are more likely to experience depression and poorer physical health by middle and older age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finnish researchers gathered patient data from a study spanning 1968 to 2021 on 369 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists calculated people’s current risk scores based on how many risky behaviors they maintain currently, from zero behaviors (no risk) to three (the highest risk, i.e., smoking, drinking, and being physically inactive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 36-year-old who smokes and drinks but also exercises would receive a two, while a 50-year-old who quit smoking but still drinks and doesn’t exercise would get a score of one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked beyond what behaviors a person has now. They looked at how many years a person maintained those harmful habits, known as the temporal risk score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People were told to count how many times they did each behavior at each age checkpoint – 27, 36, 42, 50, 61. Someone who smoked at 27, 36, and 42 but quit at 50, therefore, earned a temporal smoking score of three out of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They concluded that people who currently have those risky behaviors had more depressive symptoms based on a scored 16-item questionnaire, higher metabolic risks measured by markers like high blood pressure, large waist, and low ‘good’ HDL cholesterol, lower psychological well-being based on a scored 18-question test, and worse self-rated health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had those behaviors now, as well as in decades previously, were even worse off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who started smoking in their 20s and early 30s, as opposed to those who started in their 40s, were more than twice as likely to exhibit depression symptoms and psychological well-being scores that were 2.3 times worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Similarly, people with metabolic risk factors such as high blood pressure early in life were twice as likely to experience chronic metabolic disorders compared to those who began experiencing those risk factors in middle age&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, people with metabolic risk factors early in life were twice as likely to experience chronic metabolic disorders compared to those who began experiencing those risk factors in middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Self-rated health among those with worse physical health early in life saw double the decline in self-rated health versus those who became more inactive in their 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said: ‘Interestingly, the temporal accumulation of risky health behaviours was particularly associated with depressive symptoms in the present study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These results suggest that the accumulation of risky health behaviours over time may also be one of the important factors when preventing depressive symptoms and depression.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07853890.2025.2479233#abstract"&gt; Annals of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; had several notable limitations, though. They could not establish that risky behaviors caused poor health, only that they are linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also looked at a few risky behaviors while not considering several others, such as diet, sleep, or drug use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that the subjects were Finnish adults born in 1959, a population that may not reflect the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People may have also reported their health and habits through a rosier lens, concealing heavy drinking, misremembering bad habits, or not opening up about depressive symptoms, risking bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;They concluded that people who currently have those risky behaviors had more depressive symptoms based on a scored 16-item questionnaire in their 40s to 60s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, the study’s 30-year longitudinal design and inclusion of several health outcomes, both physical and mental, provide rare and valuable insights into the effects of lifelong habits and whether humans can undo some of the damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking is tied to a laundry list of health problems, ranging from myriad cancers to chronic lung and breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drinking excessively is known to cause severe liver damage that can prove life-threatening. And obesity is a leading risk factor for a range of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health habits don't change much during middle adulthood, researchers said, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13856347/Six-rules-living-chronic-pain-inspiring-vision-GRACE-QUANTOCK-spent-20-years-wheelchair-suffers-16-conditions.html"&gt;becoming chronic concerns&lt;/a&gt;. Their findings stressed the importance of ‘tackling risky health behaviours as early as possible’ to keep these risks from piling up over the years, ‘which can otherwise lead to poor mental well-being and health later in life.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is steeped in an epidemic of chronic diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 133 million Americans – approximately 40 percent of the US population – have at least one chronic illness. Obesity is the most common among them. Forty-two percent of Americans have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have known for years that lifestyle choices and trauma early in life, particularly childhood, significantly impact one’s health later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the latest study breaks new ground by revealing that it’s not just what you do, it’s when and for how long you do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:41:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOWEZVT1NrOVNNOEZOQWI4TzVZSExiajQ1SFcxUWRVZUllbVZBUXRDQ1Q0bW1vYjFQWXJWYWpSRzJhc0pzV2RyeTcxTmRBNU00MUJZMURETjRDQmN5SWRwQjRJQ2Yxc3NIM3BxWkFCcGRoZERYWFFlLUVGM0RxVDh5MUtxbmpHaGZlVEMzclo4dFh0ZGRJU0VfWXJMcmctNWVvUzlpNTlQdWJkSDNYWVFv0gG0AUFVX3lxTE5wODBMd3R3UElQVTRWNkp4ZHJqU0otdzIwblhKMmRCTC13MUNsMTNqWkhUT1hlRHc1akpnZzBFLW1EMGJCWnRJdjZTQ01GbVRlRkNBYmdrdmpTNWRPYnVnZ0ZTWm9YQnRCR0xaMFpZbVJHTGxUWE1HOGYzMG1pTDFrN0hMdW5GdmYtRDRYUm04OGdOZDdwSHUxbExhYV9VelZ4Ri0zeXpXQXQ2MGo5alRUdmdLSQ</guid></item><item><title>首次与年轻人结肠癌相关的流行派对组合-每日邮报 | Popular party combo linked to colon cancer in young people for the first time - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol and cigarettes have been a mainstay pairing at parties for generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a major study warns the combination of drinking and smoking raise the risk one of America's fastest-growing cancers in under-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/germany/index.html" id="mol-7a530ef0-3c96-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt; analyzed just over two dozen studies comparing regular drinkers and smokers to teetotalers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just 100 cigarettes in a person's lifetime - the equivalent of one per week for two years - was linked to a 59 percent higher risk than people who have never smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found drinking &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-b01ef0d0-3caa-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; every day raised the risk of developing early-onset colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-b01f3ef0-3caa-11f0-a16e-099e77d18cc9" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; by 39 percent, even if it's just one or two drinks per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And each can of beer or glass of wine per day further increased the chance by an additional&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;two percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13607563/Gen-Z-going-teetotal-parents-drinking-habits-alcohol-teetotal-health-young-adults.html"&gt;fewer millennials and Gen Zers drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes&lt;/a&gt; than ever before, which makes the findings difficult to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers say alcohol and cigarettes are likely just one part of the problem, with diet, sedentary lifestyles, obesity and other factors likely also playing a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drinking and smoking is a classic party combo, but the latest research shows both may raise the risk of colon cancer in young people (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Alcohol consumption and smoking are significant risk factors for EOCRC and should be addressed in the context of prevention.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol and smoking have both been linked to colon cancer in the past, as they release chemicals that destroy DNA and cause cancer cells to mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the new study is one of the first to compare both factors at once in relatively low amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates over 154,000 Americans will be stuck by colorectal cancer this year, including about 20,000 under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this is roughly in line with two decades ago, the disease is rising sharply in younger groups.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the latest data, early-onset colon cancer diagnoses in the US are expected to rise by 90 percent in people 20 to 34 years old between 2010 and 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In teens, rates have surged 500 percent since the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the new data shows a link between colon cancer and using alcohol and tobacco, it contradicts the recent decline of both habits in younger groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the 1960s, smoking rates in the US have fallen 73 percent in adults and 86 percent in children and teens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millennials and Gen Z are also drinking less than their parents. The latest Gallup research shows 62 percent of adults under 35 drink alcohol compared to 72 percent in the early 2000s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, binge drinking - four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men - is also on the rise in Gen Z women. Research published last month in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832889?guestAccessKey=d47ec1d7-0eea-48ee-a6ad-a9356c6b5f85&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041625"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt; found women ages 18 to 25 had higher rates of binge drinking than men in the same age group for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research also shows even former smokers are at an increased risk of colon cancer up to 25 years after quitting due to long-term DNA damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review, published this week in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1533002825000519#cebibl1"&gt;Clinical Colorectal Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, looked at 12 studies on alcohol consumption and 13 on smoking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the team found daily alcohol consumption in general increased the risk of early-onset colorectal cancer 39 percent compared to lower amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked at moderate alcohol consumption and high consumption. Moderate was considered one daily drink for women and two for men. High is four or more daily drinks for women and five or more for men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found people who consumed moderate to high amounts of alcohol every day had a 30 percent greater risk of colon tumors and 34 percent greater risk of rectal tumors than those who consumed low amounts of alcohol per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strongest association they found was in a 2022 study published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/3582443"&gt;Canadian Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at colorectal cancer patients with a history of alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marisa Peters, a mother-of-three from California (pictured here), was diagnosed with stage three rectal cancer at age 39&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Trey Mancini (pictured here) was a professional baseball player when he was stuck by stage three colon cancer at age 28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to patients who never abused alcohol, those with a history of alcohol addiction were 90 percent more likely to develop colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers in the new review also found the risk of colon cancer increased 2.3 percent for every 10 grams per deciliter (g/d) of ethanol, pure alcohol, consumed per day. This is the equivalent of one standard drink per day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, one standard drink is considered a 12-ounce can of beer with five percent alcohol volume, a five-ounce glass of wine at 12 percent alcohol volume or a 1.5-ounce shot glass of distilled spirits with 40 percent alcohol content, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team behind the new review wrote: 'These results clearly suggest that alcohol consumption is associated with a significantly increased risk of CRC at any age.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe when the liver breaks down ethanol, it creates the toxic chemical acetaldehyde, which damages triggers inflammation in the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This damages DNA and leads to uncontrolled cell growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol also inhibits the body's ability to absorb folate, an essential nutrient for DNA repair. Low folate has consistently been linked to higher colon cancer rates.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review also evaluated the effect of smoking on colon cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, the researchers found a 39 percent increased risk of colorectal cancer in people who smoked cigarettes regularly compared to those who never smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ever smokers,' or people who have had at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, were at a 59 percent increased risk compared to non-smokers or former smokers while current smokers were at a 14 percent greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Current smokers were shown to have a 43 percent greater likelihood of developing a rectal tumor than those who never smoked, and colon tumors were linked to a 26 percent increased risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'The results on smoking showed a significant association of smoking with EOCRC, while former smoking was not associated with EOCRC.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smoking also exposes the body to thousands of carcinogens and free radicals that destroy healthy DNA and cause cells to mutate into cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the new review, including the small number of included studies and data on alcohol and smoking was self-reported, leaving it subject to bias. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 02:38:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPTW9kRUR3MGJGNUpwd0J6dm1Mb3hSdnJhTHNvMW5na1JMUjhwTW01MlVhTUZxSHZaODU3VHZOUXJXbDNrTWJoczdzZllNRHBJdi1kemVfRTNVMTgxSmhMMVYyNXg0WmxNV2U3OExSekdsT2JKY19kMURDUFpsdUNuSm9oSWNJZUFrYVhkYXpLX0k0TkFILTRKUEw4MnRVZnNmVXFXLTcybDhZTmhVd0hiTtIBtgFBVV95cUxObUdDVXN2ME5OU25HMnM3TWdIS1k5c0YtemtLcUpfTTV3aFlmbGtZREh6bUlhYjFGZWN1WDdfZ3BqRTBQNVVPRWxCdTZVYnpKZndCU2lKUDlCZ291TUI2SHlyZkJSM3FnZzNBdndCMEk2ei1vVFVWdHRuQkVIaWcxNVd6dkhQRTRIZEpwNDk4MkZhcWQ5SEFQOEtyZGxDZEo3ZkRVaC1jNVdvcDVDUGZoQVp0SnBuZw</guid></item><item><title>感染多达50%人群的寄生虫可使人类精子斩首- ScienceAlert | Parasite Infecting Up to 50% of People Can Decapitate Human Sperm - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNTXNKel8zRHlhb1F5NlZsZVhYSzVTWE5KeUtVZDVoQTdYbkJIekwwZEthZU80Z1BkUEh3RGtwUDFXbmNyVnJ6bW51LVp0MF94b1VVZU1OSXZ6a29uUW05aTBlSm9TcU9tQmUya211aWdfMjhHZm9BYV8wbHdNT2FZd1RoY0k5Z3hzbWk4ZjI5djZuQkVYZi1DSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Male fertility rates have been plummeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmac035"&gt;over the past half-century&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis from 1992 noted a steady decrease in sperm counts and quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;since the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent study found that male infertility rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;increased nearly 80% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons driving this trend remain a mystery, but frequently cited culprits include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000745"&gt;obesity, poor diet and environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fertility-academy.co.uk/blog/7-stis-that-affect-male-fertility/"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as gonorrhea or chlamydia are often overlooked factors that affect fertility in men. Accumulating evidence suggests that a common single-celled parasite called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may also be a contributor: An April 2025 study showed for the first time that "human sperm &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;lose their heads&lt;/a&gt; upon direct contact" with the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a microbiologist, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william"&gt;my lab studies &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new study bolsters emerging findings that underscore the importance of preventing this parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infected cats defecate &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; eggs into the litter box, garden or other places in the environment where they can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/ahr2005100"&gt;picked up by humans or other animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11162542"&gt;Water, shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can also harbor infectious parasite eggs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to eggs, tissue cysts present in the meat of warm-blooded animals can spread toxoplasmosis as well if they are not destroyed by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/toxoplasma-food-safety-moms-be"&gt;cooking to proper temperature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HOnhthD3yz4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most hosts of the parasite can control the initial infection with few if any symptoms, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; remains in the body for life as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00305.x"&gt;dormant cysts in brain, heart and muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These cysts can reactivate and cause additional episodes of severe illness that damage critical organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090203"&gt;30% and 50% of the world's population&lt;/a&gt; is permanently infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; due to the many ways the parasite can spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toxoplasma can target male reproductive organs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon infection, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; spreads to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12163"&gt;virtually every organ and skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3755328"&gt;during the height of the AIDS pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, when some patients presented with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;parasitic infection in their testes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis, it can also occur in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2018-224962"&gt;otherwise healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. Imaging studies of infected mice confirm that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; parasites &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00517.x"&gt;quickly travel to the testes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the brain and eyes within days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Microscopy image of translucent, two-layers circular blobs" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=600&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/669878/original/file-20250522-56-b04lgh.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=754&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; cysts floating in cat feces. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/toxoplasmosis/index.html"&gt;DPDx Image Library/CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, my colleagues and I found that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;form cysts in mouse prostates&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have also observed these parasites in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;ejaculate of many animals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.10.034"&gt;human semen&lt;/a&gt;, raising the possibility of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109725"&gt;sexual transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reside in male reproductive organs has prompted analyses of fertility in infected men. A small 2021 study in Prague of 163 men infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12969"&gt;over 86% had semen anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2002 study in China found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479125/"&gt;infertile couples are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; infection than fertile couples, 34.83% versus 12.11%. A 2005 study in China also found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078665"&gt;sterile men are more likely to test positive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; than fertile men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622295/"&gt;Not all studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, produce a link between toxoplasmosis and sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toxoplasma can directly damage human sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans, which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;-infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096770"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108571"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9121004"&gt;rams&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107573"&gt;abnormally shaped sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that April 2025 study, researchers from Germany, Uruguay and Chile observed that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reach the testes &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/epididymis"&gt;and epididymis&lt;/a&gt;, the tube where sperm mature and are stored, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;two days after infection&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;22.4% of sperm cells were beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites. Sperm cells that maintained their head were often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;twisted and misshapen&lt;/a&gt;. Some sperm cells had holes in their head, suggesting the parasites were trying to invade them as it would any other type of cell in the organs it infiltrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct contact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may also damage sperm because the infection promotes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Inflammatory conditions in the male reproductive tract are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913230/"&gt;harmful to sperm production and function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the harmful effects &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may have on sperm could be contributing to large global declines in male fertility over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="Series of microscopy images of slightly deformed sperm with holes in their heads" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=699&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/670065/original/file-20250523-56-l81t63.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=879&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sperm exposed to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;.

(&lt;a class="source" href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;Rojas-Barón et al/The FEBS Journal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Preventing toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can infiltrate male reproductive organs in animals is compelling, but whether this produces health issues in people remains unclear. Testicular toxoplasmosis shows that parasites can invade human testes, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2025.116709"&gt;symptomatic disease is very rare&lt;/a&gt;. Studies to date that show defects in the sperm of infected men are too small to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some reports suggest that rates of toxoplasmosis in high-income countries &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.10.003"&gt;have not been increasing&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades while male infertility was rising, so it's likely to only be one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of this parasite's potential effect on fertility, it is wise to avoid &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. An infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects if someone acquires it for the first time during pregnancy, and it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people. &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; is also the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death from foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23408"&gt;proper care of your cat&lt;/a&gt;, promptly cleaning the litter box and thoroughly washing your hands after can help reduce your exposure to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. You can also protect yourself from this parasite by washing fruits and vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures"&gt;cooking meat to proper temperatures&lt;/a&gt; before consuming and avoiding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/605433"&gt;raw shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-raw-water-compare-to-tap-water-a-microbiologist-explains-why-the-risks-outweigh-the-benefits-246866"&gt;raw water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1982.03330140038029"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256892/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Some top-selling protein bars contain emulsifiers and synthetic preservatives - such as polysorbate, carboxymethyl cellulose, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), and sodium benzoate - that have been linked to gut inflammation and various health problems. At the same time, plenty of protein bars are laden with artificial sweeteners and sugar substitutes such as erythritol, sucralose and acesulfame potassium that have been associated with a heightened risk of heart disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To help you find the healthiest options, we analyzed hundreds of protein bars and interviewed dietitians and nutrition experts. They said that whenever possible, you should always prioritize getting your protein from real food, such as plain Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs, nuts and sliced turkey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But it’s fine to have a protein bar several times a week for convenience, said Zumpano, especially if the alternative is junk food. “I would rather someone choose a protein bar over a bag of chips from a vending machine,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Here’s what you should avoid when choosing protein bars - and better ingredients and brands to seek out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excessive amounts of added sugar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;It’s okay to eat protein bars that are lightly sweetened with such things as dates and honey, especially if you exercise, said Amy Stephens, a sports dietitian at New York University. Carbohydrates replenish your body’s glycogen stores and help your body use protein to build muscle, she added. But you should avoid bars that are loaded with added sugar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As a general rule, look for bars that have an added sugar content that is less than half the total amount of carbs, Stephens said. If a bar has 20 grams of carbs, for example, then it should contain less than 10 grams of added sugar. If it has more than that, it’s best to find another option.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Fake’ sugars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Don’t be duped by bars that claim they have little or no sugar. In many cases, these bars are made with artificial sweeteners and other sugar substitutes. “If a protein bar has one gram of sugar but it’s loaded with artificial sweeteners then I would not consider that healthier than a protein bar that has just a little honey or dates in it for sweetness,” said Zumpano at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The amount of sugar you’d be cutting from your diet is likely minimal anyway, and research suggests that sugar substitutes may&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;have surprising side effects. Some have been linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, said Allison Sylvetsky, an associate professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. “That raises the question of whether they really are helpful or not,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Common sugar substitutes in protein bars include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list |  list_unstyled list_counter_reset unordered font_size_18"&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sugar alcohols such as erythritol, maltitol, xylitol and sorbitol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Artificial sweeteners such as sucralose, aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame potassium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Natural” sweeteners such as stevia, allulose and monk fruit extract. These low and no-calorie sweeteners are derived from plants, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re better for you, Sylvetsky said. “There’s a consumer perception that they’re healthier because they’re from plants,” she added. “But there’s not much evidence to support that.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="how_to_pick_a_healthier_protein_bar" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

If you’re vegan, look for plant proteins like soy and pea protein. “These are also great sources of protein,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least 10 grams of protein: Choose bars that have between 10 and 20 grams of protein. “That’s a decent amount,” Zumpano said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Fiber: Eating fiber helps keep you full and satiated, and it nourishes your gut microbiome. Look for bars that have about 3 to 5 grams of fiber per serving, Zumpano said. But the more the better. “If a bar has more than 5 grams of fiber, that’s great,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="list_counter_increment flex align_items_base"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whole food ingredients: Choose bars that are made from “real food” ingredients such as oats, seeds, egg whites, dates, almonds and peanuts. “The ingredients should be things that you can pronounce and recognize,” Stephens said. “If you’re not really sure what an ingredient is, it’s likely something that’s highly processed and that might not be good for your health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h3 id="the_healthiest_protein_bars" class="heading | bold font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile

Aloha protein bars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;These bars are relatively low in sugar, high in fiber and have a good amount of protein. Most of the bars have 14 grams of protein and in some cases as much as 10 grams of fiber. That’s roughly a third of the recommended daily fiber intake for adults. The bars are made with mostly simple ingredients, such as almonds, rolled oats, brown rice protein, cashew butter and chocolate chips.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The ingredients are awesome, and the bars are plant-based,” Stephens said. They’re available in at least 21 flavors, including almond butter cup, blueberry, chocolate caramel pecan, and chocolate chip cookie dough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "&gt;&lt;span class="caption | margin_right_half"&gt;The Aloha peanut butter chocolate chip bar. These bars are relatively low in sugar, high in fiber and have a good amount of protein.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit uppercase"&gt;Rey Lopez for The Washington Post/for The Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. TRUBAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;These bars contain 12 grams of protein and large amounts of fiber - up to 14 grams per bar, which is about half your recommended daily amount of fiber. They’re relatively low in added sugars compared to other bars, and they’re not artificially sweetened. They contain a blend of plant proteins along with such things as almonds, organic coconut and unsweetened chocolate, and tapioca fiber.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. RXBAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;These protein bars are a favorite among dietitians because they’re made from just a handful of simple ingredients that you probably have in your kitchen, such as dates, egg whites, nuts, coconut and other dried&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;fruit. They contain 12 grams of protein, four to six grams of fiber, and 14 to 17 grams of sugar. While these bars are generally on the sweeter side, their sugar content comes from the dates and other dried fruits - not from table sugar, corn syrup or other added sugars. “These bars can be great in the afternoon for a quick snack,” Stephens said. “I like them because they have a moderate amount of protein and ingredients that you can recognize.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Another good option are RXBAR Minis, which contain about half the calories and total sugar of the regular RXBARs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

They also have more protein - 16 grams - than a lot of other bars we analyzed. They’re high in fiber and contain little or no added sugar, and they’re made from real-food ingredients such as peanuts, dates, almonds, cocoa, chicory fiber and coconut. They’re available in nine&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;flavors, and they come in plastic-free packaging, including compostable wrappers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.

They’re slightly sweeter than some other protein bars, with around 7 to 13 grams of added sugar per bar. But they also have a decent amount of protein (10 to 12 grams) and fiber (2 to 3 grams) per bar. They’re available in 15 flavors, and they’re gluten-free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;We recommend their “Celestial Delight” protein bar, which is made with white chocolate and macadamia nuts.

But they contain a lot of other wholesome ingredients, including sunflower seeds, cherries, bananas, dark chocolate and cinnamon. Each bar has 12 grams of protein, and they come in a variety of flavors, such as banana bread, dark chocolate brownie and chocolate chip blondie. They’re also allergy-friendly: They’re vegan, nut-free, gluten-free, and made without wheat, soy, eggs and other top allergens, making them&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a good choice for people with food allergies and sensitivities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Epic Bars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Most protein bars are sweet.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;But these Paleo-friendly Epic bars are a good choice for people who want a savory option that’s not plant-based. They’re made from a handful of whole-food ingredients such as bison, pork, grass-fed beef and venison, along with a variety of spices and seasonings. They’re slightly lower in protein than other bars - ranging from about 7 to 13 grams of protein per bar - but they’re also fairly low in fat, sugar and calories, Stephens said. One caveat is that some of the flavors are high in sodium. We recommend the Bison Bacon Cranberry and Beef Uncured Bacon + Apple bars, which are among the flavors that are lowest in sodium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Some other good protein options from Epic are their “salmon bites” made from wild Alaskan salmon, and their “snack strips” made from Wagyu beef and wild salmon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Picky Bar protein bars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Picky Bar company was founded by a group of professional endurance athletes. Their protein bars contain a mixture of plant proteins, healthy fats and complex carbs thanks to such ingredients as nut butters, dried fruit, oats and seeds. Their protein bars have 10 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, and 2 to 6 grams of added sugar. They also fit a variety of dietary restrictions: They’re vegan and gluten, dairy and soy-free. They come in two flavors: “Apple Cinnawin” and “Peanut Chocolate Champ.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 01:26:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPb2sybG9ISzR1VVItTGRkWS1EZElCTDNrMldrQjZVbGtJeHpzWnlpN3R1Sl9TSXhJaFJIYWZxUm5tMWRWTDdtS0xjMDVVT3oxNER3bHJOREktZjFWdFJ5eTFsSk9za2JuaW9Qei1vMUtLU0V4cS1BbTFwYkt5Um9kejhyVUswYWJr</guid></item><item><title>旧金山湾区麻疹患者本月可能接触过其他人-旧金山纪事报 | Bay Area resident with measles may have exposed others to the virus this month - San Francisco Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxPZTc3U2g2TktTU3JnLUxfN19iZnpYNUJJdFo1TW9iQnBDbE9JbHJpVHI1X2ZyTEg2cDB3enZCMGhxLU5CY2xCWnF3MURTb0NhUHZFVG1pdEM3Vzlkblp0TUhTNVJZbl9ETHEwWEZvY2VzQVdxV2p5Y05oNEROR3hGMkt4NEY3R21GUzVDYWZhMC1IZ3lX?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/topics/measles" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt;
    
       have been identified in North Dakota, including in a previously uninfected county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North Dakota Health and Human Services Department announced on Thursday, May 29, the state’s 28th case, up seven from last week. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The latest case was the first reported in Burke County in far northwest North Dakota. The release did not identify the age of the infected individual but said they traveled frequently to 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-reports-first-case-of-measles-since-2011" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Williams County, where the first case was reported.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams County has nearly half the state’s cases with 13 infections, according to Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has reported 23 cases in people who are less than 20 years old, including three in children 5 years old or younger.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Burke is the fourth county in North Dakota to have a measles case. Cass and Grand Forks counties reported seven cases each as of Thursday. At the end of last week, Cass County reported six cases and Grand Forks County reported two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in Divide County may have been exposed to the virus, Health and Human Services said. Places of possible exposure in Crosby include Lindsey’s Grocery Store at 211 Main St. S. from 3 to 5:30 p.m. Monday and Dollar General, 1108 Fourth St. SE, between 3:20 and 5:45 p.m. Monday, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the highest number of measles cases reported in North Dakota since 1978, when 211 cases occurred,” state Immunization Director Molly Howell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Dakota has a vaccination rate of almost 90%. The risk of measles to vaccinated residents is low, Health and Human Services said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Measles is highly contagious since it can spread through the air and linger in rooms for up to two hours, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People with measles are contagious before and after symptoms appear, increasing the risk of unintentional spread,” the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state recommends two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine — the first between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the vaccine provide 97% protection, while one dose is 93% effective, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The MMR vaccine is effective for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents who were born before 1957 are considered immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have contracted the virus should monitor symptoms for 21 days, while unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles should quarantine for the same time period, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information on measles and the vaccine can be found at

The researchers crunched the data to look at the link between being self-employed and having cardiovascular risk factors like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, glucose intolerance, obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, binge drinking, sub-optimal sleep duration, and poor mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Researchers discovered lower rates of certain cardiovascular risk factors between people who were self-employed and those who were salaried. White women who were self-employed had a 7.4 percent lower risk of obesity, 7 percent lower risk of being physically inactive, and 9.4 percent drop in having poor sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The change in risk was slightly different for self-employed women of color. These women had a 6.7 percent lower risk of having a poor diet, 7.3 percent lower risk of being physically inactive, and 8.1  percent lower risk of getting poor sleep.  Self-employed white men also saw a drop in certain factors, although it wasn’t as noticeable.

One is that women who are self-employed may be able to dictate their work schedule more and have less stress as a result, she says. Self-employed women with more free time may possibly have “less perceived stress compared to women with less autonomy,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jennifer-l-wong" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jennifer Wong" data-node-id="14.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jennifer Wong&lt;/a&gt;, MD, cardiologist and medical director of Non-Invasive Cardiology at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA.

of offering the “spectacular” drug more widely to men whose disease has not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now a team from the US, UK and Switzerland have built an AI test that shows which men would most likely benefit from abiraterone. The “exciting” breakthrough will enable healthcare systems to roll out the drug to more men, and spare others unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The AI test is being unveiled in Chicago at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the world’s largest cancer conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nick James, professor of prostate and bladder cancer research at the Institute of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research in London and a consultant clinical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, co-led the team that built it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Abiraterone has already hugely improved the outlook for hundreds of thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer,” said James. “We know that for many men with cancer that has not yet spread, it can also have spectacular results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But it does come with side-effects and requires additional monitoring for potential issues with high blood pressure or liver abnormalities. It can also slightly increase the risk of diabetes and heart attacks, so knowing who is most likely to benefit is very valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This research shows that we can pick out the people who will respond best to abiraterone, and those who will do well from standard treatment alone – hormone therapy and radiotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The test uses AI to study images of tumours and pick out features invisible to the human eye. The team, funded by Prostate Cancer UK, the Medical Research Council and Artera, trialled the test on biopsy images from more than 1,000 men with high-risk prostate cancer that had not spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The AI test identified the 25% of men in the group most likely to benefit from the abiraterone – for these men, the drug halves the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the trial, patients received a score – biomarker-positive or -negative – which was compared with their outcomes. For those with biomarker-positive tumours, one in four of the men, abiraterone cut their risk of death after five years from 17% to 9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For those with biomarker-negative tumours, abiraterone cut the risk of death from 7% to 4% – a difference that was not statistically or clinically significant, the team said. These men would benefit from standard therapy alone and be spared unnecessary treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"morning-briefing","successDescription":"Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, it has been available for men with this indication in Scotland and Wales for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Abiraterone costs just £77 per pack, compared with the thousands of pounds that new drugs cost,” said James. “I truly hope that this new research – showing precisely who needs the drug to live well for longer – will lead to NHS England reviewing their decision not to fund abiraterone for high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Matthew Hobbs, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, described the AI test as “exciting”. He added: “We therefore echo the researchers’ urgent call for abiraterone to be made available to those men whose lives it can save – men who, thanks to this research, we can now identify more precisely than ever before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 23:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxOZy1LcWVVZnFMSlRaWU1NQnRxaGJJRnZOeXFmMHhkRHpXTnJZSVZ3ZzZPbUd0RzctQ3NUMDNhQkVYSUlHV3lzVVd5ZnotQndvV1R6MjA3eFlTZ1B2dzF2WF9ybmxXVEpTeWdFTTZaOEVZaHNvanVnVEZxYWVjay1vTDQwSUE0d1VMS2xJVmNJUUpNVkJkQ3liSDdaOGExcjlxa2pDXzYzd0VKX19DdWVzaHhQWklEbjhlcUZ4OA</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您应该吃7种最好的罐头食品，以获得更好的血糖- EatingWell | The 7 Best Canned Foods You Should Be Eating for Better Blood Sugar, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE55Mkpnc2FOek1Fc19HLS1KUkZfenBoSGlURXlCTHVyQndoY3p6aFdUSUs4Smp0N0NadGpWbi0tUjJQM0w3aXRRcU50eEh0VW9CLXAtaENDaElJcXZLRXZ1X2JmSkc2YXhBN1ozQw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fish, such as tuna and salmon, are great protein options to keep on hand for managing blood sugar. “Protein slows digestion and increases satiety, or feelings of fullness, which promotes stable blood sugar,” says &lt;a href="https://lilianshepherd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lilian Shepherd, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;One 3.5-ounce serving of canned tuna contains 19 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Canned salmon provides about 22 grams of protein per 3.5-ounce serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These fish also pack omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to support brain health and may help prevent cognitive decline as you age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Shepherd suggests having &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7935164/tuna-salad-with-egg/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tuna Salad with Egg&lt;/a&gt; for a filling lunch or using canned salmon to make these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/248780/easy-salmon-cakes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Easy Salmon Cakes&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned chicken is a no-fuss way to add lean protein to many recipes without the need to cook, a great shortcut for recipes that call for shredded or rotisserie chicken. A 3.5-ounce serving of canned chicken contains 25 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try using canned chicken in a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8024089/creamy-broccoli-cauliflower-chicken-casserole/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Creamy Broccoli-Cauliflower Chicken Casserole&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned vegetables are a convenient and affordable way to add more fiber and micronutrients to your diet, and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/274447/fresh-vs-canned-vs-frozen-which-is-better/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;they are just as nutritious as their fresh counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber in canned veggies slows digestion, helping to prevent blood sugar spikes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned veggies are incredibly versatile and can be tossed into casseroles and soups, like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261637/slow-cooker-vegetable-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Slow-Cooker Vegetable Soup&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use them as a simple side dish. Look for low-sodium or no-salt-added options to limit sodium intake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a couple of cans of tomatoes in your pantry is always a good idea. “Canned tomatoes can flavor soups and stews and can be used to make salsa or pasta sauces,” says &lt;a href="https://ontheroadmeals.com/about-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Hannah Heredia, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of On the Road Meals. “They are fairly low in carbohydrates and rich in antioxidants like lycopene, which supports heart health."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are an excellent source of fiber and plant-based protein, and both nutrients are important for maintaining stable blood sugar levels. A 3.5-ounce serving of canned black beans provides about 7 grams of protein and 7 grams of fiber, while 3.5 ounces of canned chickpeas (aka garbanzo beans) provides 7 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This combination of protein and fiber slows down glucose absorption and helps maintain steady blood sugar levels throughout the day,” says &lt;a href="https://www.musiccitynutritionandwellness.com/music-city-nutrition-and-wellness-founder-emily-haddock" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Emily Haddock, RD,&lt;/a&gt; a dietitian and owner of Music City Nutrition &amp;amp; Wellness. She also recommends adding canned beans to soups, salads and grain bowls.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned pumpkin is rich in fiber, with one 3.5-ounce serving of canned pumpkin puree containing 3 grams of it. Pumpkin also has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties thanks to its high vitamin A content, providing more than 100% of your Daily Value of the nutrient per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Haddock suggests using canned pumpkin in sauces for savory dishes or adding it to smoothies for a creamy texture, like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/260736/pumpkin-pie-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pumpkin Pie Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;. “Pumpkin also goes great in baked goods to enhance moisture and reduce fat content,” adds Haddock.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fruit is a convenient and affordable option for managing blood sugar. “To reduce added sugar content, opt for canned fruits packed in water or fruit juices rather than syrup, if available,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-barron-ms-rd-ld-831b6843/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jessica Barron, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of The Red Head RD&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She also suggests pairing fruit with a food containing fat or protein to manage blood sugar. For example, try adding canned fruit to low-fat Greek yogurt or cottage cheese for a satisfying blood-sugar-friendly snack.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned foods can be a healthy and convenient option for managing blood sugar, as long as you know what to look for. Here are some things to consider when stocking your pantry:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opt for low-sodium or no-salt-added options when possible. While managing blood sugar is the focus, lower sodium intake may also help support healthy blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When low-sodium options aren’t available, rinse canned foods under cool running water to reduce sodium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be mindful of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; in canned foods, especially for fruits that are canned in syrup. Look for options with no added sugars or those canned in water or their own juice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the expiration date. Canned foods have a long shelf life, but they don’t last forever. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t dismiss store brands. There’s a common misconception that store brands are lower quality compared to their branded counterparts. Grocery stores nationwide have affordable canned options, which can allow you to enjoy nutritious fruits and vegetables with less financial strain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A blood-sugar-friendly diet includes fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, legumes, fiber and healthy fats. Combining carbohydrates with protein, fiber and fat slows digestion, mitigating blood sugar swings and leaving you full and satisfied for longer. Here’s how to make the most out of canned foods:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canned beans are good for more than chili. Try them in a quick side dish, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/259682/broccoli-chickpea-pomegranate-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Broccoli, Chickpea &amp;amp; Pomegranate Salad&lt;/a&gt;. Combine tuna and beans for a fiber-packed lunch or snack with this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269012/tuna-white-bean-dill-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Tuna, White Bean &amp;amp; Dill Salad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you normally use fresh fruits in your smoothies, salads, desserts and parfaits, canned fruits can be a big time and money saver. We also love using canned fruit in recipes like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270911/easy-peach-cobbler/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Easy Peach Cobbler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/266430/cabbage-tofu-edamame-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Cabbage, Tofu &amp;amp; Edamame Salad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a lackluster salad that’s missing protein? Try adding canned chicken or fish for a protein and flavor boost. Toss in some canned chickpeas for extra protein and fiber. You can also use canned chicken in soups and casseroles the same way as you would use cooked chicken.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a healthy diet high in protein, fiber and healthy fats is important for healthy blood sugar levels. Canned foods offer convenient, affordable and shelf-stable options, making it easier and quicker to prepare balanced meals and snacks. Add canned vegetables to soups and stews, or serve canned fruits like pineapple or peaches as a healthy dessert. When shopping, look for canned foods without added sugars and excess sodium.

Researchers used EEG and AI to analyze sleep in 40 adults after caffeine or placebo intake, identifying less predictable brain signals and increased wake-like brainwave patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine altered deep sleep rhythms by dampening theta and alpha waves while stimulating beta waves linked to alertness. These effects were most pronounced in 20-somethings, likely due to age-related differences in adenosine receptor density, suggesting younger brains are more vulnerable to caffeine’s nighttime impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine reduced slow-wave sleep rhythms and increased beta wave activity, keeping the brain in a more alert state overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Criticality Increase:&lt;/strong&gt; Caffeine pushed the brain into a higher state of complexity, balancing order and chaos, even during sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Younger adults (20–27) experienced stronger effects due to higher adenosine receptor density.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine is not only found in coffee, but also in tea, chocolate, energy drinks and many soft drinks, making it one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a study published in April in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;, a team of researchers from Université de Montréal shed new light on how caffeine can modify sleep and influence the brain’s recovery, both physical and cognitive, overnight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research was led by Philipp Thölke, a research trainee at UdeM’s Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Laboratory (CoCo Lab), and co-led by the lab’s director Karim Jerbi, a psychology professor and researcher at Mila – Quebec AI Institute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working with with sleep-and-aging psychology professor Julie Carrier and her team at UdeM’s Centre for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, the scientists used AI and electroencephalography (EEG) to study caffeine’s effect on sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They showed for the first time that caffeine increases the complexity of brain signals and enhances brain “criticality” during sleep.  Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Criticality describes a state of the brain that is balanced between order and chaos,” said Jerbi. “It’s like an orchestra: too quiet and nothing happens, too chaotic and there’s cacophony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Criticality is the happy medium where brain activity is both organized and flexible. In this state, the brain functions optimally: it can process information efficiently, adapt quickly, learn and make decisions with agility.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Added Carrier: “Caffeine stimulates the brain and pushes it into a state of criticality, where it is more awake, alert and reactive While this is useful during the day for concentration, this state could interfere with rest at night: the brain would neither relax nor recover properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;40 adults studied&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study how caffeine affects the sleeping brain, Carrier’s team recorded the nocturnal brain activity of 40 healthy adults using an electroencephalogram.  They compared each participant’s brain activity on two separate nights — one when they consumed caffeine capsules three hours and then one hour before bedtime, and another when they took a placebo at the same times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We used advanced statistical analysis and artificial intelligence to identify subtle changes in neuronal activity,” said Thölke, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results showed that caffeine increased the complexity of brain signals, reflecting more dynamic and less predictable neuronal activity, especially during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) phase of sleep that’s crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive recovery.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also discovered striking changes in the brain’s electrical rhythms during sleep: caffeine attenuated slower oscillations such as theta and alpha waves, generally associated with deep, restorative sleep, and stimulated beta wave activity, which is more common during wakefulness and mental engagement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These changes suggest that even during sleep, the brain remains in a more activated, less restorative state under the influence of caffeine,” says Jerbi, who also holds the Canada Research Chair in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This change in the brain’s rhythmic activity may help explain why caffeine affects the efficiency with which the brain recovers during the night, with potential consequences for memory processing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People in their 20s more affected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the effects of caffeine on brain dynamics were significantly more pronounced in young adults between ages 20 and 27 compared to middle-aged participants aged 41 to 58, especially during REM sleep, the phase associated with dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young adults showed a greater response to caffeine, likely due to a higher density of adenosine receptors in their brains. Adenosine is a molecule that gradually accumulates in the brain throughout the day, causing a feeling of fatigue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Adenosine receptors naturally decrease with age, reducing caffeine’s ability to block them and improve brain complexity, which may partly explain the reduced effect of caffeine observed in middle-aged participants,” Carrier said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And these age-related differences suggest that younger brains may be more susceptible to the stimulant effects of caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given caffeine’s widespread use around the world, especially as a daily remedy for fatigue, the researchers stress the importance of understanding its complex effects on brain activity across different age groups and health conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They add that further research is needed to clarify how these neural changes affect cognitive health and daily functioning, and to potentially guide personalized recommendations for caffeine intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this caffeine, sleep, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe94d09d918c9a9b9f8bd3999f849f9792929bbe8b9391908a8c9b9f92d09d9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Julie Gazaille&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umontreal.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Montreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Julie Gazaille – University of Montreal&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08090-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep&lt;/a&gt;” by Philipp Thölke et al. &lt;em&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caffeine induces age-dependent increases in brain complexity and criticality during sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive stimulant worldwide. Yet important gaps persist in understanding its effects on the brain, especially during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed sleep electroencephalography (EEG) in 40 subjects, contrasting 200 mg of caffeine against a placebo condition, utilizing inferential statistics and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that caffeine ingestion led to an increase in brain complexity, a widespread flattening of the power spectrum’s 1/f-like slope, and a reduction in long-range temporal correlations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being most prominent during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, these results suggest that caffeine shifts the brain towards a critical regime and more diverse neural dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults (20–27 years) compared to middle-aged participants (41–58 years) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, while no significant age effects were observed during NREM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpreting these data in the light of modeling and empirical work on EEG-derived measures of excitation-inhibition balance suggests that caffeine promotes a shift in brain dynamics towards increased neural excitation and closer proximity to a critical regime, particularly during NREM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 22:40:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBrTE9DNHZJeWlZZ1lyVElCc1ZCU1YtYXZrMDc5VjV5UDF1dVVuYklHX044cDF3cURSb1gtZjFHcTZtVWZmcnNoMHdtMURpTDY3NWRiX3h0ckxjVHcyeWN2dzcwMUREWlNocGpOWmR3</guid></item><item><title>数百万美国人服用的常见草药补充剂可能与致命的肝损伤有关-雅虎 | Common herbal supplements taken by millions of Americans could be linked to deadly liver damage - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPTXBidFpySm1YTmNabEJFTE1JS2ZGb0RtUEZSQ2Z3aUswZGx1SEpvU2txeFAwX092OEZpaEJvM1lOSERla2k3aHR0QnV3THBOZHViZmJJUEFRRzdSQWxTeDNnbUo1bmpPSU9VSmZJSnJKcERBaEs0RmQtaDFLeXp6NmdQZ1Q1T2ZpYkFXS0F2M2Q?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Commonly-used herbal and dietary supplements taken by millions of Americans to stay healthy have been tied to a rising number of cases of &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/uk-news/adults-liver-disorder-over-eating-b2058118.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:liver damage and toxicity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;liver damage and toxicity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Supplement-related liver failure that required U.S. patients to be put on a waitlist for a transplant increased by eight times the previous level from 1995 through 2020, according to a 2022 study in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34331346/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Liver Transplantation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liver Transplantation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

But, overuse of some can result in liver damage and toxicity (Getty/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, what are the offending supplements tied to these cases? You may regularly use them in cooking. Many patients take them with the aim of improving their health. The bright yellow spice turmeric is the most commonly consumed in the U.S., according to a study published last year in the journal&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2821951" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Network Open;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;. Black cohosh, red yeast rice, &lt;em&gt;Garcinia cambogia&lt;/em&gt;, and green tea extract were also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11301549/#:~:text=Turmeric%20or%20curcumin%2C%20green%20tea,the%20general%20population%20are%20unknown." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:identified on a list compiled by researchers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;identified on a list compiled by researchers&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“When you cook with turmeric, that could be really safe. But some of the supplements now are 2,000 milligrams plus, which is a very high dose of turmeric,” Halegoua-De Marzio said, noting that adding black pepper could make the liver “really sick.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Online, many of these supplements are promoted as more natural options than prescription medications. But, they are not subject to the same kind of testing and scrutiny as other drugs. That’s not the only issue. Physicians say insufficient attention in medical screenings and mislabeling are two other problems to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We performed analytical chemistry and found about a 50 percent mismatch between stated ingredients on the label and what they actually contained, which is quite alarming,” Dr. Robert Fontana, a University of Michigan Medicine hepatologist, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.michiganmedicine.org/health-lab/15-million-americans-take-supplements-may-be-toxic-liver" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “If you buy a supplement and it says it has a certain ingredient, it's basically a coin flip if that’s true or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/news/new-research-on-the-potential-dangers-of-turmeric-supplements-2292932" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fewer than 40 percent;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fewer than 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of patients willingly tell their doctors about the supplements they are taking, according to Kaiser Permanente primary care physician Dr. Crystal Xue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Without the guiding hand of doctors, people who take too much may not realize the risk. New Jersey’s Robert Grafton told NBC News that if he hadn’t been in the medical field, he might have taken more supplements to help him feel better. Instead, following a trip to the hospital, he found out he had a drug-induced liver injury after taking ashwagandha, turmeric pills, and other supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking turmeric and green tea extract is linked to risk, according to University of Michigan researchers. Most users do not take the supplements on the advice of a doctor (Getty/iStock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some people are even genetically vulnerable to this kind of damage.

&lt;p&gt;Cases of babesiosis, a rare disease most commonly spread by bites from deer ticks, are growing in Maryland and the mid-Atlantic region, according to a study published in the Journal of Medical Entomology, and so is the range of ticks infected with the parasite that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the idea of a new tick-borne disease to watch out for can be worrisome, researchers are aiming to ensure that residents and health care providers are informed about the illness and its growing threat in the area, especially as summer approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a freak-out issue because we can diagnose it and we have a cure,” said Ellen Stromdahl, an entomologist who worked at the Defense Centers for Public Health’s vector-borne disease laboratory in Aberdeen. “It’s an awareness issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-WczsESEJ" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_WczsESEJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stromdahl was one of nearly two dozen researchers who collected and tested ticks in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia, looking for ones that carried the parasite that causes babesiosis. Less than 3% of the deer ticks researchers tested were found to be infected with the parasite, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland’s Eastern Shore and the Baltimore region are hot spots for ticks carrying babesiosis, the study says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people with babesiosis don’t feel sick or have symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but some may experience flu-like symptoms such as a fever, chills, sweating, body aches, appetite loss, nausea or fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms may start a week after being infected, but typically develop over the course of a few weeks or months. The illness can be worse — even life-threatening — for older people or for those who have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“It’s rare, but if it’s overlooked, the consequences can be really bad,” Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of reported cases of babesiosis in Maryland remains low, though data from the Maryland Department of Health show an increase over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, for instance, there were 29 reported babesiosis cases in Maryland — a jump from seven cases in 2022 and 13 cases in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyme disease, Maryland’s most common tick-borne illness, is far more prevalent, with 2,463 probable cases reported in 2023. Some symptoms of Lyme disease can be similar to babesiosis, but the two illnesses are treated differently, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors generally prescribe antibiotics for Lyme disease. But if you’re still sick even after taking antibiotics, it may be time to return to the doctor and ask about babesiosis, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to stay safe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend time outside in grassy, bushy or wooded areas, wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. When you come inside, check your clothing and body for any ticks. And if you find a tick, remove it quickly using tweezers. You can dispose of the tick by putting it in a sealed bag or submersing it in alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re bitten by a tick, you can save it to show to a doctor, too, Stromdahl said.&lt;/p&gt;

When it comes to snack options, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960178/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-eggs-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eggs are often one of the top protein-packed snacks&lt;/a&gt; that come to mind, for various reasons. Besides the fact that each large egg offers 6 grams of protein, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/748967/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, eggs are also delicious, nutritious and versatile.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Truthfully, there isn’t a standard definition for a high-protein snack, but we're using an egg an ideal reference point to compare other foods because it is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938628/high-protein-foods-list-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best high-protein foods&lt;/a&gt;. To give you other options, we've rounded up a list of versatile, tasty, portable and convenient protein-rich foods that offer as much or more protein than one large egg.

For example, one small can of salmon (75 grams) has 19 grams of protein, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2341706/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. Canned salmon, tuna, trout and sardines—where the bones are often tiny and soft enough to eat—are also sources of calcium and vitamin D.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pair the canned fish with whole-grain crackers, or use it to make a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267208/tuna-salad-spread/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; to go with cucumber slices and carrot sticks.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to viral TikTok trends elevating humble &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7965913/tiktok-two-ingredient-high-protein-ranch-dressing-recipe/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt;, it's one of the most popular items in the dairy aisle. Tangy and tart, cottage cheese boasts 12 grams of protein for every half-cup serving, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/328841/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A half-cup of edamame, in pods, has 9 grams of protein, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/2398224/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Edamame is an excellent snack because of its &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;filling fiber&lt;/a&gt;—4 grams per ½-cup serving. What we love about edamame is that they are easy to prep—steam, boil or microwave them in their pods, or use shelled edamame, and flavor them with a dash of salt, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262111/edamame-with-aleppo-pepper/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Aleppo pepper&lt;/a&gt; or seasoning of your choice.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  Another way to enjoy shelled edamame is by whipping it into &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251218/edamame-hummus-wrap/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Edamame Hummus&lt;/a&gt;.

A 1.5-ounce serving of almonds, or about 35 almonds, has 9 grams of protein, according to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/170567/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;. And while all nuts will provide some protein, besides almonds, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;other nuts&lt;/a&gt; that rank among the highest in protein include peanuts, pistachios and cashews. But almonds boast the most fiber, vitamin E and calcium of all tree nuts.

According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/2340772/nutrients" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, milk kefir has 9 grams of protein per cup. It is also an excellent source of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D—all of which, along with protein, are essential nutrients for bone health. Because kefir is fermented, it also provides probiotics—those gut-loving beneficial bacteria. If you love the tang, drink it on its own or use it as a base for smoothies, like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267226/berry-mint-kefir-smoothies/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Berry-Mint Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262123/raspberry-kefir-power-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Raspberry-Kefir Power Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are looking for an alternative protein to eggs, don't forget about strained whole-milk yogurt, including Greek-style yogurt.

Strained yogurt is a source of calcium and probiotics and is a portable snack that can be enjoyed in a pre-portioned container. Eat it as-is, blend it into a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/249318/fruit-yogurt-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;smoothie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/260856/greek-yogurt-with-fruit-nuts/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;dress it up&lt;/a&gt; with your favorite fruit and nuts.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If whole almonds aren't your thing or you want to incorporate them in different ways, try mixing things up by enjoying them as a spread, like almond butter.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A half-cup of cooked chickpeas has more than 7 grams of protein, per the&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/173757/nutrients" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; USDA&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, these little legumes also have 6 grams of digestion-friendly (and filling) fiber per ½-cup serving. Chickpeas are also a good source of iron. Pairing them with vitamin C-rich foods, like a citrusy dressing, will help your body better absorb the iron, which is important for energy production.
