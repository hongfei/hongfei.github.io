			&lt;p&gt;"How often do you poop?" might sound like a very personal question, but your answer could reveal quite a lot about your overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in July 2024 investigated how often 1,425 people went number two, and compared those stats to their demographic, genetic, and health data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pooping too often or too rarely were both associated with different underlying health issues, while the healthiest participants reported pooping once or twice a day – a 'Goldilocks zone' of bowel movement frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study shows how bowel movement frequency can influence all body systems, and how aberrant bowel movement frequency may be an important risk factor in the development of chronic diseases," &lt;a href="https://isbscience.org/news/health/timing-is-everything-isb-study-finds-link-between-bowel-movement-frequency-and-overall-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; University of Washington microbiologist Sean Gibbons, the corresponding author of the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-in-your-poop-may-predict-an-imminent-death?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Something in Your Poop May Predict an Imminent Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These insights could inform strategies for managing bowel movement frequency, even in healthy populations, to optimize health and wellness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by a team from the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), investigated the bathroom habits of people who were "generally healthy" – that is, with no history of kidney or gut issues like kidney disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or Crohn's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the studied variables" class="size-medium wp-image-132891" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-461x415.jpg 461w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-600x540.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants provided samples of blood plasma and stool, in addition to filling out extensive diet, health, and lifestyle questionnaires. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Johnson-Martínez et al.,&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These participants self-reported how often they dropped the kids off at the pool, and the researchers organized them into four categories: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-constipation-could-be-having-a-serious-impact-on-your-heart"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt; for those reporting one or two bowel movements per week; low-normal for three to six movements per week; high-normal for one to three movements per day; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/severe-diarrhea-cases-surging-across-uk-and-scientists-dont-know-why"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; for four or more watery stools per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed patients' blood metabolites and chemistry, their genetics, and the gut microbes present in their stool samples. The team then looked for possible associations between bowel movement frequency and these health markers, as well as other factors like their age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, those who reported less frequent bowel movements tended to be women, younger, and with a lower body mass index (BMI). But even accounting for these factors, people with constipation or diarrhea showed clear links to underlying health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteria usually found in the upper gastrointestinal tract were more common in stool samples from participants with diarrhea. Their blood samples, meanwhile, showed biomarkers associated with liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stool samples from people with less frequent bowel movements had higher levels of bacteria associated with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.201100542"&gt;protein fermentation&lt;/a&gt;. This is a known hazard from constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If stool sticks around too long in the gut, microbes use up all of the available dietary fiber, which they ferment into beneficial short-chain fatty acids. After that, the ecosystem switches to fermentation of proteins, which produces several toxins that can make their way into the bloodstream," &lt;a href="https://isbscience.org/news/health/timing-is-everything-isb-study-finds-link-between-bowel-movement-frequency-and-overall-health/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Johannes Johnson-Martinez, a bioengineer at ISB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, some of these byproducts were found in these patients' blood samples. Particularly enriched was a metabolite called indoxyl-sulfate, a known product of protein fermentation which can damage the kidneys. The team suggests this is potential evidence of a causal link between bowel movement frequency and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some hope that people can change their habits and as a result, their health. Those in the Goldilocks zone of pooping reported eating more fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-study-lists-health-benefits-of-drinking-more-water-each-day"&gt;drinking more water&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pooping-before-you-exercise-has-an-incredible-effect-on-performance"&gt;exercising more often&lt;/a&gt;. Their stool samples showed high levels of bacteria associated with fermenting fiber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, everybody's found themselves at one extreme or the other at some point in their lives, after catching a stomach bug or eating too much cheese. But this study was looking more at people's everyday routine, and how our own version of 'normal' could hint at health issues we weren't aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101646"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The U.S. has reported 1,277 cases since the start of the year, according to NBC News’ tally of state health department data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Earlier this year, the U.S. also recorded its first &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles deaths&lt;/a&gt; in a decade: two children in Texas and an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-new-mexico-resident-tests-positive-death-rcna195231" target="_blank"&gt;adult in New Mexico&lt;/a&gt;. All were unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the past 25 years, measles has been considered eliminated in the U.S. because it has not continuously spread over a year-long period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are still periodic outbreaks, however, including one that took off in in a Mennonite community in West Texas earlier this year. Vaccination rates in Gaines County, the center of the outbreak, are particularly low: As of the 2023-24 school year, 82% of kindergarteners in the county had received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) vaccine, far below the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;95% rate needed to curb spread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. David Sugerman, a senior scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a meeting of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee in April that measles would have to keep spreading through January 20 of next year for the U.S. to lose its elimination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the cases so far this year are linked to the Southwest outbreak — there have been more than 700 cases in Texas alone — though a number of smaller outbreaks, resulting from international travel, have been detected across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt; The resurgence of measles can be attributed, in part, to declining vaccination rates both globally and nationally. During the 2023-24 school year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm?s_cid=mm7341a3_w" target="_blank"&gt;less than 93% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. received the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine, down from 95% during the 2019-20 school year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The West Texas outbreak parallels one in 2019 among &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Orthodox Jewish communities in New York&lt;/a&gt; with low vaccination rates. The U.S. recorded 1,274 cases that year. A vaccination campaign, which included a vaccine mandate in New York City and officials &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;administering 60,000 doses&lt;/a&gt; in affected communities, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank"&gt;helped contain the spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;New York’s response was “an incredible feat and something we’re obviously trying to emulate,” Sugerman said. But he noted that the loss of Covid grant money has created “funding limitations” in Texas. The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;slashed $11.4 billion in Covid funding&lt;/a&gt; last month, some of which helped state health departments respond to disease outbreaks. Each measles case may cost $30,000 to $50,000 to address, which “adds up quite quickly,” Sugerman said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many disease experts have also &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-texas-rfk-jr-response-vaccines-doctors-wary-rcna194510" target="_blank"&gt;expressed concern that the federal messaging&lt;/a&gt; around vaccines could make the outbreak harder to contain. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has called for people to get the measles vaccine, he has also framed vaccination as a personal choice, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-draws-misinformation-playbook-touting-inhaled-steroid-treat-me-rcna200085" target="_blank"&gt;emphasized unproven treatments&lt;/a&gt; like steroids or antibiotics and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/health-secretary-rfk-jr-measles-vaccine-falsely-claims-wanes-rcna200636" target="_blank"&gt;falsely claimed that immunity from measles vaccines wanes quickly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician who treats patients in Lubbock and Gaines County, said at a press conference in April that misinformation was the “biggest nemesis” for healthcare providers. She was aware of some patients taking vitamin A instead of getting vaccinated, she said. Kennedy has played up the role of vitamin A in helping measles patients, though &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-a-measles-virus-texas-cdc-what-know-rcna194288" target="_blank"&gt;it’s unclear how beneficial it is&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC says vitamin A can be administered under the supervision of a healthcare provider, but it’s not a treatment for the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Countering the misinformation put out there about using vitamin A for treatment of measles has been a struggle, an upward struggle,” Montanez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;By contrast, two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles and offer lifelong protection. The virus is particularly dangerous for babies and young children, whose immune systems aren’t always developed enough to fight an infection. In Texas, officials recommended an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-vaccine-effort-parents-babies-rcna207819" target="_blank"&gt;early dose for babies ages 6 to 11 months&lt;/a&gt;. Unvaccinated children over 12 months old should get one dose, according to the state, then a second dose 28 days later.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles often starts with a high fever, cough, runny nose and pink or watery eyes. From there, people may develop white spots on the insides of the cheeks near the molars and a blotchy rash of flat, red spots. Severe cases can progress to pneumonia or swelling of the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Roughly 1 to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles die from respiratory and neurological complications, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 11:45:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPb1VQRDNUMFV6QlAwaGRxQlhvNUczM0s5SFQ1MzZjS05xT0x4TVdXMWNjSXByNElsUnM4dWdKRURIR1gwMi1LT3U4N05EN2lQOWtlZ2dYaVlYblppY1RLYkJYbEFueGtvZUQzeDFWZlBrWmUzUEREOFhYTEdPZ01EcVluUE9rNnk5SGtwVWpoc29DblozQ2JQTDVsZEpqWVZiNUhkZEoxV0ZEUG40RjNmNkRLeXB3bnV2emfSAVZBVV95cUxPV1N2RjZlUmVBdk1KS0J5WU01YTd6RFgxSVBuVWZkN001OFhicDhYN0RxRFdqM1RPVmx5bGoyM2RlY0wzRDlub0d5RG4tMFVDZGo4QnpsQQ</guid></item><item><title>Mounjaro用户对奇怪的副作用引发明显的体重增加感到震惊： “感觉就像我在扩张” -每日邮报 | Mounjaro users horrified as bizarre side effect triggers apparent weight GAIN: 'feels like I'm expanding' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOdWYxQ08tM19LNTFZWl84bjlsUm9VUm43bnpJdURrTUlpN3BtcTk1T1lQNDV5SklPdm9tZDdFLUFfTGs5QVVIX00tR3hjTUhEQW9LeVllUzJJaUIwRVI0TG9xWU9UTXQ2eUJGVE1oYl9jbm4zWEQzRHZxVXB1aGt6SHc2MFlMa3A4ek9iMHlwT1p2UWxtQmtlRjk1a3RtZ195WHZZ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE9GT1JGNWo3SVZCVFVYSE1LbzQ1bW5mc3NQamZDcXZBMzlyNV9ELWhQUjJKMjg3RThEaWRkR0w2X1BqN1JZZHlOczVxcVdjOVZHWXI5N2JkNmk0RUdpNVRCYzNVS2FXZllyUml1UF9famI2bkJ5dHdRX0hMTFFPQ0hVc2RTNFZPRFNrZW9aU3l3MlJ2QVQxdjhxMFJZYkRHem9sWmRzRmNwcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mother-of-three who shed two stone in just nine weeks by using weight loss injections has warned other users of a painful side-effect—which has left her looking bigger than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once aimed at &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-cad313e0-5be3-11f0-9818-43978d934320"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; patients, Mounjaro has been dubbed the 'King Kong' of skinny jabs, bringing about rapid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-cadcfef0-5be3-11f0-9818-43978d934320"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; by reducing appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the injections often come with side effects including severe bloating, nausea, diarrhoea and in some severe cases, life-threatening organ damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kayleigh, 37,  from Kent, weighed over 19 stone (120kg) and dropped to around 17 stone (107kg) within just nine weeks of taking Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The jabs, which can now be prescribed by GPs free of charge in England, initially vastly improved Kayleigh's relationship with her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she shared shocking images taken before and after her weekly dose which reveals she suffers from extreme bloating—causing her stomach to balloon to more than double its normal size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The photos, taken just 24 hours apart after taking a 5mg dosage of the medication, show Kayleigh clutching her abdomen, which looks swollen and very painful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-three shared the agonising side-effect with her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kleelin2/video/7521755316015435030?is_from_webapp=1&amp;amp;sender_device=pc&amp;amp;web_id=7494180809390786070"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; followers, adding that the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14609885/GP-persistent-bloating-sign-deadly-cancer.html"&gt;bloating &lt;/a&gt;is usually accompanied with vomiting and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kayleigh shared her symptoms with her 6,000 TikTok followers, saying that she suffers painful bloating every time she takes the medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The jabs spur weight loss by mimicking the actions of hormone GLP-1, which is naturally released in the gut after eating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other jabbers flooded her post with support and tips, with some complaining of similar symptoms, whilst others suggested it could be caused by slower digestion triggered by the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One commented: 'Any time I eat something it's like I'm pumped up!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another said: 'Every meal I eat my stomach swells like a balloon too.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injection, like other weight loss jabs such as Ozempic and WeGovy, works by mimicking the actions of a hormone released in the gut after eating, called GLP-1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as signaling the pancreas to produce more insulin, Mounjaro disrupts signals between the gut and brain, keeping users fuller for longer and delays the stomach from being emptied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14860347/bizarre-effect-weight-loss-jabs-drunk-alcohol-reddit.html"&gt; Professor Penny Wad,&lt;/a&gt; a pharmaceutical experts at King's College London, this alone could be enough to trigger painful bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Delayed stomach emptying might delay the transit of carbohydrate through the gut,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This gives certain foods more time to produce gas in the intestine, through gut bacteria digesting and fermenting them—causing painful bloating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bloating can also be caused by various medical conditions such as IBS, Crohn's disease and small intestinal bacteria overgrowth (SIBO), which occurs when there is an abnormal increase in the amount of bacteria in the small intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alongside bloating these conditions can also cause other distressing digestive issues, such as cramps, diarrhoea, nausea and blood in the stool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alongside the bloating, which usually happens around 24hours after taking the jab, Kayleigh also experiences nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea - common side-effects of the blockbuster jabs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kayleigh told her followers that her bloating is reduced by taking Wellgard probiotics which support digestion and bowel regulation by boosting the number of healthy bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, bloating is not the only adverse side-effect experienced by Mounjaro users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, the UK medicines regulator launched a probe into the safety of fat jabs, after hundreds of users developed pancreatitis, leaving ten dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it has received more than 560 reports of people developing an inflamed pancreas after taking the jabs since they were first launched. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Side effects such as these continue to be a significant burden on the NHS and studies have shown they account for one in six hospital admissions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is predicted that adverse drug reactions could cost the NHS more than £2.2 billion a year in hospital stays alone, Dr Alison Cave, the MHRA’s chief safety officer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These blockbuster jabs have also been credited with lowering blood sugar levels for people with type 2 diabetes, but experts have warned they are not a silver bullet and can come with a number of serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year a sobering report suggested Britain's spiraling obesity levels—which costs the economy around £75billion a year—have fuelled a staggering 39 per cent rise in type 2 diabetes among people under 40. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kayleigh has lost two stone on the medication &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent estimates suggest that about 1.5 million people in the UK are taking weight loss jabs, which can help users lose up to 20 per cent of their body weight in just a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And the numbers using them privately where it costs around £250 a month are even higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as severely obese patients in England with a BMI over 40 and at least four obesity-related health conditions such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14838139/GPs-dish-King-Kong-weight-loss-jab-Mounjaro-TODAY-free-NHS-YOU-qualify.html"&gt;will be offered Mounjaro &lt;/a&gt;free of charge from their GP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The weekly injection will be offered to around 220,000 people over the next three years under new NHS prescribing rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within 12 years, around for million Britons are expected to be receiving the jabs on the NHS.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, like any drug, side effects are wide-ranging and include issues like nausea and abdominal pain as well as digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 11:43:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOdWYxQ08tM19LNTFZWl84bjlsUm9VUm43bnpJdURrTUlpN3BtcTk1T1lQNDV5SklPdm9tZDdFLUFfTGs5QVVIX00tR3hjTUhEQW9LeVllUzJJaUIwRVI0TG9xWU9UTXQ2eUJGVE1oYl9jbm4zWEQzRHZxVXB1aGt6SHc2MFlMa3A4ek9iMHlwT1p2UWxtQmtlRjk1a3RtZ195WHZZ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE9GT1JGNWo3SVZCVFVYSE1LbzQ1bW5mc3NQamZDcXZBMzlyNV9ELWhQUjJKMjg3RThEaWRkR0w2X1BqN1JZZHlOczVxcVdjOVZHWXI5N2JkNmk0RUdpNVRCYzNVS2FXZllyUml1UF9famI2bkJ5dHdRX0hMTFFPQ0hVc2RTNFZPRFNrZW9aU3l3MlJ2QVQxdjhxMFJZYkRHem9sWmRzRmNwcg</guid></item><item><title>腿上的标志很容易被忽略，这可能表明你有致命的疾病，在50多岁以下成为一种流行病-每日邮报 | Easy to dismiss sign on your legs which could indicate you have killer condition that's becoming an EPIDEMIC in under 50s - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOa19KSW9OcWdmbFp3Q1NzM1o0a2lCTDhZQ0VuYzhZUDJGTThrVDloU1NUcmRIZDhKeUNReWVsY2poVUdKWVVQR0pCVlc1aV9fajdaZUV2SWVwdnFOdm52SWt3aEE0NHh1WEtVWmEzdXlYQmY1WC1vU0lKZl9uaUxFblFodk1sM0FaUDlDbmNiaWw0T3lKUzlVa1I2M1c0YnZlazBFetIBqgFBVV95cUxOdlZPcWhuUzVFdnBsMDMzMldOaElSQ0NVZllYWUREQi1jNWFwV0h6Wkw5MEVnVDdGQ3VvdEJrdkdmQnRsTzJ6OGNjUDNvNURwTVRnTVhORmdpV3hfbXRvbHA0eTB6UkJhdnpCRzhMYzNvbGs0Nm4zSEo5YVRuTG1DMG94QVdsMkZnb0lJeDE2VGUwazF0ajl5QURsNnRjZmhyeXlwS0syN2Nrdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the skin on your legs, feet and toes is starting to look bald and 'patchy' it might be the first signs you've developed a life-threatening disease, an expert has warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hair loss on your legs and toes can be a tell-tale sign of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-ae0f0660-5bd4-11f0-b17b-91b8673311f0" class=""&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to debilitating and uncomfortable complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;US-based diabetes expert Kenneth Harless says that hair loss on the lower limbs and extremities can be a sign of diabetic neuropathy, which is when the disease damages nerve cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numbness in the hands and feet is one of the most common signs of the disease, which affects 5.8million Britons and 38.4million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drkenny11/video/7524279266771619103?_r=1&amp;amp;_t=8oct1F2d79C&amp;amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaeYosRhx_t-pw2gLVvLFgVzsJQQPlHy59wMyCTtliLZec7IgvFnKl4xw2PYDQ_aem_0BV6Fnut3EZk8N-r6AVwvQ"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;posted on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-ae16a780-5bd4-11f0-b17b-91b8673311f0"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;

SNAP is a lifeline for many individuals, families and people with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More than 62% of SNAP recipients are part of families with children. In 2022, 20% of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/food-stamps-and-family-snap-recipients-by-family-structure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:children under 18;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;children under 18&lt;/a&gt; nationwide were in families receiving SNAP benefits. More than 38% of SNAP recipients are from working families. And more than 37% of families receiving SNAP include someone who is &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/a-closer-look-at-who-benefits-from-snap-state-by-state-fact-sheets#Alabama" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disabled or elderly;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;disabled or elderly&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CBPP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Without SNAP, families miss meals. Kids show up to school hungry. Parents skip groceries to keep the lights on. We’re not talking about convenience. We’re talking about survival,” Erica Williams, executive director of the nonprofit &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="http://www.aredcircle.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:A Red Circle;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;A Red Circle&lt;/a&gt; and co-author of the peer-reviewed food policy brief &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.foodsystemsjournal.org/index.php/fsj/article/view/1349" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food Pricing and Consumer Choice;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Food Pricing and Consumer Choice&lt;/a&gt;, tells Yahoo. SNAP is crucial because “it’s the most direct tool we have to reduce hunger,” she says. Most of the families Williams works with tell her that they don’t want to be on SNAP forever but need help while they “get stable,” she points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SNAP can be used to buy &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a variety of foods;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;a variety of foods&lt;/a&gt;, including dairy products, meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables and snack foods. However, the program has limitations. “You can’t buy hot food or household goods like soap and diapers,” Williams says. “You also can’t buy prepared meals, which means parents working two jobs can’t just grab something healthy on the go. It reinforces exhaustion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although SNAP helps many people get by when they don’t earn enough to buy groceries, it often isn’t enough. Rising food costs and eligibility restrictions make it challenging for many SNAP recipients to meet their needs. Yahoo talked to five people about what being on SNAP is really like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="were-both-trying-but-were-still-hungry"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'We’re both trying. But we’re still hungry.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Danielle, a single mother in Missouri, works full-time in administrative support. She started receiving SNAP benefits when her son Marcus, now 20, was a baby, and his father stopped paying child support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today, Danielle works 40 hours a week and still receives SNAP benefits. Marcus, who is neurodivergent, lives at home while he takes classes at a community college and works about 15 hours a week. Yet, despite having two working adults in the house, Danielle and Marcus don’t earn enough to feed themselves adequately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Danielle’s SNAP benefits help, but they are still struggling. Marcus stopped receiving benefits when he turned 18 because he was in school full-time and wasn’t working enough hours to qualify for SNAP. Now, Danielle has to feed herself and her son with SNAP benefits meant for one adult. “I understand the rules,” Danielle tells Yahoo. However, she emphasizes that she’s unwilling to let her son go hungry or drop out of school and have a chance at a more financially stable life. “That means I skip meals so he doesn’t have to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Danielle usually buys foods like dry pasta, rice and canned vegetables to stretch her grocery budget. Eggs are a rare luxury, and she relies on a nonprofit food bank for fresh produce. Most of Danielle and Marcus’s diet is “Heavy. Salty,” Marcus says. “You feel full, then you crash. I get foggy. Slow. Food’s supposed to be medicine,” Marcus tells Yahoo. However, his limited diet often makes him feel worse. “We’re both trying. But we’re still hungry,” Danielle says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Danielle wants people to know that “this isn’t about laziness. It’s not about people gaming the system. It’s about working families, caregiving parents, students trying to get out and still falling short.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="snap-is-not-charity-its-a-stabilizing-force"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'SNAP is not charity. It’s a stabilizing force.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Like Danielle, Jessica is also a single mother living in Missouri. She’s been on and off SNAP since 2012. She typically buys items like flour, cereal, cheese and salmon with her SNAP benefits. Occasionally, she buys fresh fruit and vegetables and treats like ice cream or chicken nuggets for her son. However, due to the higher cost of fruit and vegetables, Jessica often finds that her benefits aren’t enough to support a healthy diet. To fill the gap, Jessica relies on nonprofits like A Red Circle. “The biggest challenge of being on SNAP is finding affordable quality food,” Jessica tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even though Jessica would like to feed her son a healthy diet, she laments that her SNAP benefits are often just enough to cover “pantry fillers.” Another challenge to staying healthy on SNAP is that "you can’t buy vitamins, medicine or supplements,” she says. That makes it harder to stay healthy in the long run, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nevertheless, SNAP is a lifeline for Jessica. “Without SNAP, feeding my family would be incredibly hard. With the cost of living so high and wages so low, it would be a serious struggle,” she explains. “SNAP is not charity. It’s a stabilizing force,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-literally-wouldnt-be-surviving-without-snap"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I literally wouldn't be surviving without SNAP'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Megan, who lives alone and has chronic Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses, worked as a public servant in New York for 24 years. For her entire career, she helped others in need, including people struggling with mental illness and families whose loved ones were placed in child or adult protective services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although Megan wanted to continue working, her health worsened, and she had to leave her job. Once Megan’s savings ran out, she relied on local food pantries for food. When that wasn’t enough, she applied for SNAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Megan still visits food pantries. However, she uses her SNAP benefits to “round out meals from the ingredients the food pantry provides,” she says. Since Megan usually gets canned and boxed goods from the food pantry, she usually uses her SNAP benefits to buy meat and produce. However, she notes that because of the high price of fresh fruit, produce “feels like a luxury.” Moreover, although Megan tries to cook everything from scratch to save money, she keeps one or two pre-prepared meals on hand to eat when her illness flares and she’s too fatigued to cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I literally wouldn't be surviving without SNAP,” Megan tells Yahoo. “Having SNAP has given me some peace of mind regarding access to food.” However, Megan is concerned because SNAP benefits don’t automatically increase when &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-snap-benefits-arent-keeping-up-with-the-rising-cost-of-food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:grocery prices;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;grocery prices&lt;/a&gt; go up. Due to rising grocery prices, “the SNAP benefits don't stretch as far in covering what's needed for a month,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Megan is doing what she can to help with her recovery, but doesn’t know when or if she will be able to return to work. “Every fiber of me just wants to have my prior level of functioning back,” she says. “I loved the work that I did. I loved my clients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She adds: “I'm hopeful that I will medically improve enough to be able to return to work and discontinue SNAP, but it will realistically be a few years, at best.” Until then, “SNAP is a lifeline for me,” Megan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-would-have-had-a-hard-time-paying-for-my-essentials"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I would have had a hard time paying for my essentials.'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ryan Wilson, a disabled videographer from Colorado, was on SNAP for seven years. Like &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/why-including-people-disabilities-workforce-133700705.html" data-ylk="slk:many people with disabilities;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;many people with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, he had a hard time finding a job that paid him a living wage. “The job market was and is tough,” Wilson tells Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When he wasn’t earning enough to cover his basic expenses, SNAP helped him get by. He told Yahoo that without SNAP, “I would have had a hard time paying for my essentials” like food and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, Wilson emphasizes that SNAP helped him survive but not thrive. When he was on SNAP, he couldn’t use his benefits to buy necessities other than food. Additionally, he could only use his benefits at select locations like big box stores, even though smaller grocery stores were often closer. “That is an inconvenience, especially for someone with a disability that impacts their mobility,” Wilson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now Wilson runs a video production company called &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://teamtrustproductions.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Team Trust Productions;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Team Trust Productions&lt;/a&gt;. His income has increased, and he no longer needs SNAP to ensure he can access enough food. Wilson is grateful he received SNAP when he needed it, but he never expected to receive SNAP benefits forever. “It's a temporary option. It does not have to be a permanent solution to financial uncertainty,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-would-definitely-not-be-eating-three-meals-a-day"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'I would definitely not be eating three meals a day'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although Laura, a single woman from Pennsylvania, worked full-time, her income wasn’t enough to support herself. For three years, Laura received SNAP benefits to help her get by. Eventually, she started earning a higher salary and no longer needed SNAP to buy food. However, in early 2025, Laura lost her job. Once her unemployment benefits ran out, she started receiving SNAP benefits again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Without SNAP, “I would definitely not be eating three meals a day,” Laura tells Yahoo. She usually uses her SNAP benefits to buy frozen fruits and vegetables, chicken thighs and seasonal fruit and vegetables, which she finds more affordable than out-of-season produce. When she can afford it, Laura buys cheese and coffee. She also goes to her local food pantry to supplement her groceries. However, she emphasizes that food pantries are “meant to be just that — supplemental, not a source of regular groceries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Laura is grateful for the SNAP benefits she receives, but thinks some aspects of the program need to be changed. “I wish we could buy paper products,” she says. “Toilet paper is just as necessary as apples, and I wish I could just get everything at once.” She also wishes that restrictions on what SNAP recipients can buy, such as candy and hot foods, would be removed. Plus, Laura finds it difficult to figure out which foods she can buy with her benefits and which are excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“No one should be told what food they're allowed to buy. Food is a human right,” Laura says. “By making laws that just blindly eliminate whole sections of foods, that just makes it harder on people with specific diets. Or, it makes it impossible to give a little kid a birthday party,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most importantly, Laura wishes she could rely on SNAP being around for those who need it. She’s still looking for a full-time job that pays enough for her to support herself. Until then, however, "it’s always in the back of my mind that my access to food could be taken away at any time. Depending on a program that's outside of your control, just to feed yourself, is terrifying,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 09:00:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizAFBVV95cUxQcGhTRlMtYXFtZUlSRFpSdzQzcmxMSGxkMml0ZUxMZWFNVlRES0liZUNIakFQSTl5TEdOUEtxY3ZDNElfeHpLUVIzREptcDcwQkN1NUhzYXh0U3JUbFg1eFphb25JbnU3LXI4NHB3T3FZQjM0ak0xNFdqYU95cGg5RGEwb0ZiWHpRWUtwR280SzlJZGx4SHU4M3RSQVAzanpxcUR4OXNLX19nbXlrTTJZTW5fdWg3bGxKVGVZNC1DU1hfdEQycmJHakc1WHE</guid></item><item><title>轮式肺癌筛查-《纽约时报》 | Lung Cancer Screening on Wheels - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQVXlIOEJHMm5uMkRtZHJHMzBfd3R4ZXRLTmM1b05YQVZzZFQwdFBDT3BPQjh3MDRWYUZFOHNBNDBGaW5PUDRNaDllamNnNVNfOTFfV2Z4TkMzWE80bXhIQXNXRjJlMTBUWklPczJnWFBPQ0VuQTI0R0M2UkJWa0VBMS1CLXdDQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 07:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQVXlIOEJHMm5uMkRtZHJHMzBfd3R4ZXRLTmM1b05YQVZzZFQwdFBDT3BPQjh3MDRWYUZFOHNBNDBGaW5PUDRNaDllamNnNVNfOTFfV2Z4TkMzWE80bXhIQXNXRjJlMTBUWklPczJnWFBPQ0VuQTI0R0M2UkJWa0VBMS1CLXdDQQ</guid></item><item><title>使您的锻炼与您的个性相匹配可以使锻炼更愉快，并给出更好的结果- CNN | Matching your workouts to your personality could make exercise more enjoyable and give better results - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxPTld0SjZ6TWlRZGdDbHdjeDZ5anBxWEVCOEt5T1Y4UW80dVVKWktTUE5HcV95cDlCTXVuT2Z2dEYwVWE5TkhUNlotbldzVlVqY3dwNGZWak52SktEZm02alJqQnlPYjkteml6NGRibkFlT1dXc2lRV010bkVCUHpvS25sdlRiY3JRQnozRGJzbTlOQdIBlwFBVV95cUxQV1RiWFplSHZDUlY2ZUplSUQwRmxGTGhYV0FqaDAybU82Z05mbmxiR3o0aEwzaEhPS3BmYmh1OTVtVXd5UDJWcmF6QVZFdlliNGREU0pfRjU3NFZTWndfT0Rqd0E4MXNSVXNWbmV3bFFLY0ljbzVjMkkxTlFMTmpDSG84Yzk4V01naUpPVVc3WUEtTHU0ZHBn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Making &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/exercise-recommendations-workout-quiz-wellness/"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; fun is the holy grail for many people who can’t quite find the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/26/sport/london-marathon-running-spt-intl"&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt; to work out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct68fcv0000356mqqowwdbc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But rather than forcing yourself to enjoy running or that gym class you once attended, the solution may lie in something more straightforward — simply matching a workout to your personality type, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1587472/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;Frontiers in Psychology&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6bbjs0006356mwfvvl1gl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s because people with different personality traits enjoy different types of exercise, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6dmd90009356mau78elt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More extroverted people, for example, prefer high-intensity training sessions with others, such as team sports, while people who scored highly on “neuroticism,” a metric that measures someone’s emotional instability, preferred private workouts without people watching them and punctuated by short breaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6dtzl000c356m6spz1fdv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As for those who scored highly on conscientiousness, they “were more likely to have a well-rounded fitness … and we think that’s because conscientious individuals are more likely to be driven by the fact that exercise is good for them,” said the study’s co-lead author, Flaminia Ronca, an associate professor in exercise science at University College London.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6e0e0000f356mhyrknkc7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Personality determines which intensities and forms of exercises we’re attracted to. … If we can understand that, then we can make that first step in engagement and exercise in sedentary individuals,” she told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6f4mc000i356mh58fc80x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These findings have important implications for encouraging more people to exercise, especially since just 22.5% of adults and 19% of adolescents worldwide manage the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization-recommended&lt;/a&gt; 150 minutes of physical activity per week, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6ffx3000n356m3fbozy1p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By focusing on personality types, health care providers may be able to offer a “more personalized approach to exercise,” said Angelina Sutin, a professor at Florida State University who specializes in investigating links between personality and health, and who wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6fqzh000q356mwsth2b0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Typically … we tell people to exercise and just say: ‘We know high-intensity interval training is good for you, so you should do it,’” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6g7k8000t356m08kzz03z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But for people high in neuroticism, they’re not going to do it, and we also know that low-intensity exercise can be beneficial too. Knowing that somebody is high in neuroticism, recommending that kind of exercise, maybe people will be more likely to engage in it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6gcfx000w356mmea0y3vf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It is also important to note that personality traits interact with each other, Ronca added. Some people score highly on both neuroticism and conscientiousness, meaning that although they may find exercise anxiety-inducing, they are much more likely to do it since they know it is good for them, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6hakc000z356m9zdq8vpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To reach their findings, Ronca and her colleagues in London first directed the 132 study participants, aged between 25 and 51 years old, to complete a questionnaire revealing their personality traits.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6henz0012356m3zrwjy1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study employed a commonly used model that conceptualizes someone’s personality through five traits — extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, openness and conscientiousness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6j1lm0017356mtat7iplm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Personality traits … they’re just descriptions of the way people behave in certain situations,” Paul Burgess, a professor of neuroscience at UCL who co-led the study, told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6jqqm001a356mf5s98lgi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And the way that people behave in certain situations is determined to a large degree by their brain capabilities, what they notice, what they pay attention to, what they can remember, how fast they can react.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6jvca001d356me5yr0fm1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers then ran fitness tests on the participants and randomly sorted them into two groups. One group was given an eight-week cycling and strength plan, while the control group&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;did 10 minutes a week of stretching exercises. Of the original 132 participants, 86 completed both pre- and post-testing either side of these eight weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6lcmn001g356murskf0jw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study team found that, although fitness improved across all personality types for those who completed the cycling and strength program, there was a marked difference in enjoyment of the exercises. More extroverted people enjoyed the higher-intensity lab fitness tests, while more “neurotic” people enjoyed the home-based light-intensity sessions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6lidg001j356migml94oo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Personality traits also informed how exercise influenced someone’s stress levels. People who scored highly in neuroticism had a significant reduction in self-reported stress, much more than in any other group, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6lv9m001m356mvq32ltzm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those who would benefit the most from a stress reduction are the ones who actually showed a decrease in stress following those eight weeks of exercise,” Ronca said. “And I think that’s quite a powerful message to give.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6lzqt001p356mxlzskehv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Given the many benefits of exercise, including stress reduction, both Ronca and Burgess hope their findings encourage people to find alternative ways of exercise outside the more traditional workouts they might dislike.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6m6j3001s356m4nsv2p91@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a danger, perhaps, that the focus becomes … competitive sports and serious engagement at a time when young people are starting to have lots more demands on them,” Burgess said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmct6mdlu001v356mkg2tdlv3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are a lot of personalities that don’t respond well to that kind of situation, that find it quite stressful.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

From late-night snacking to endless screen time, skipped meals to excess salt, it’s our daily routines that may be damaging our cardiovascular health, regardless of age, gender, or body size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-1" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is commonly believed that heart disease occurs only in older or obviously unfit individuals. Actually, cardiovascular disease can accumulate over years, maybe in young, thin, or 'healthy-looking' people. Heritability, stress, and lifestyle are factors, and prevention is the way to go," Dr Vikrant Khese, Cardiologist, Apollo Clinic, Kharadi, tells Health Shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-2" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the incidence of heart-related conditions in individuals below 50 years of age, has seen a rise. This busts the myth that heart disease is only for older people or men, says Dr Nitin Bote, Interventional Cardiologist, K.J. Somaiya Hospital and Research Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-3" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are actually seeing an increasing number of young patients, including women, presenting with early symptoms of heart disease, caused by stress, lifestyle, and hormonal changes. Another myth is that if you take medication, lifestyle modifications are not required. This is very much not the case. Medication controls risk but long-term cardiac health relies on habit changes," adds Dr Bote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-4" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Daily habits that affect heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the daily lifestyle habits that may silently raise cardiovascular risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-5" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Chronic sleep deprivation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inadequate rest increases stress hormone levels and blood pressure, straining the heart. According to a 2010 study about sleep duration as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, there was an increased risk of Congenital Heart Disease in subjects with sustained 5 or fewer, 6, 7, and 9 hours or more, compared with those with 8 hours of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-6" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Excess screen time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you spend hours on phones or in front of the TV, be mindful. Studies have found a correlation between excessive use of mobile phones and TV screens, and an increased risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and ischaemic heart disease. This is because these activities promote a sedentary lifestyle, affecting circulation and movement, and thereby raising the risk of obesity, which is not good for the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-7" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Constant late-night snacking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a habit of late-night snacking can disrupt metabolism, impact insulin levels, and even add to weight and cholesterol issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-8" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Skipping meals or eating irregularly&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bote, missing meals or consuming huge, irregular portions, can raise insulin levels and disrupt metabolic balance, indirectly impact &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/web-stories/5-simple-ways-to-boost-your-cardiovascular-health-visual-story-11733739591540.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="cardiovascular health"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-9" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Excess salt intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most overlooked threats for your heart? Salt. Both Dr Khese and Dr Bote, agree that excessive salt is one of the biggest risks for heart damage. "Through processed snack foods, restaurant meals, or what may be perceived as benign condiments, most individuals take in twice the daily recommended amount of sodium," says Dr Bote. Explaining the risks, Dr Khese adds, "Consuming salt in excess on a regular basis increases blood sodium concentrations that attract fluid into the blood vessels, causing them to swell. This is what increases blood pressure and causes the heart to work more forcefully, which can lead to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (thickening of heart muscle), and eventually heart failure. Too much salt consumption also hardens arteries in the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-11" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. High sugar and trans-fat consumption&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to take care of your heart? Give up or reduce sugary drinks, packaged snacks, and fried foods, which tend to increase inflammation and unhealthy cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-12" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Low intake of fibre, fruits, and vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of nutrient-dense foods means the body misses out on key antioxidants and heart-protective fibre. Your diet plays a key role in protecting your heart, so if you consume a high-trans fat diet with added sugar and red meat, with low fibre, fruit, and vegetable consumption, you may be inviting a cardiovascular risk, says Dr Khese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-13" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8. Physical inactivity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even normal-weight individuals are at risk for unfavourable lipid profiles, hypertension, and insulin resistance if they are sedentary. Sedentary life affects circulation, causes inflammation, and promotes the development of plaque in the arteries, independent of body size. "Everyday physical movement, even just walking, can dramatically lower cardiovascular risk," asserts Dr Bote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-14" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;9. Unmanaged chronic stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term emotional stress can elevate blood pressure and contribute to hormonal imbalances that affect heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-15" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10. Skipping routine medical check-ups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing preventive screenings can delay diagnosis of high blood pressure, cholesterol, or early-stage heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-16" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to improve your heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention is the best cure! So, making simple, sustainable shifts like eating more fibre, avoiding sugary beverages, sleeping well, managing stress, and even simply &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.livemint.com/web-stories/how-walking-daily-improves-your-health-visual-story-11740563987461.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="walking"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; for 30 minutes daily — can dramatically reduce long-term heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-17" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular health check-ups, especially after the age of 30, are crucial to catch warning signs before they turn critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="article-index-18" class="storyParagraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heart disease is preventable in most cases. By being mindful of what we eat, staying physically active, managing stress, and getting enough sleep, we can protect our hearts from damage that builds silently over time," says Dr Bote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="end-of-story-0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Mint</author><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2025 03:30:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4AFBVV95cUxNRng2RGJtWm9zMW4xeS1reGtJNmxhanB5UEJ6QXVRbkpZdEl2dnV2dng4T0hhNzQ0UzZWM3Rtb3VWVm91OHVkaEVUVDlVSU9MRksxMENQNHlYRURMek5kc0l3VmliMW5MODMxaVQ1NlIxdU04MmprWTFvbEFlWnZ0TDlsTVNhdGNUb1dTRlRoVTNKU1RyS3N1SU42NFBROEpycy1oOVFwLUtWYjNSeS0yclpPb3pyak5zZll4WmxZWVZyZndQV2FUMlhaTExCeUZTWkR6YWgtTndfamR0SDZaRg</guid></item><item><title>咳嗽药物可以预防一些帕金森最严重的症状- ScienceAlert | Cough Medicine May Protect Against Some of Parkinson's Worst Symptoms - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxObENJalNnXzlaZnRWaWcwdl9mVFEyNHdWSnRpVHlWMHBBVk5JM21kaVJvemJjTXRWNEZUUnY4MzcxUWZfcUdXeUF1WUx4WXR4ZE1yWEhybUk0WFBScllTMWRJSVdfcC01UGtBc3dyOXZEVU1hUXA2QlpON3UzSnVwTVJKWVV3dEt2MU5pUjduQ2pWM2YxSXM0TlUxYnFKQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An active ingredient in cough medicines since 1979 has shown promise as a treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms in  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="166748" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease-related dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambroxol"&gt;ambroxol&lt;/a&gt;, isn't approved for use in the US, Canada, or Australia, but it is commonly found in cough syrups and tablets from Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a gold-standard phase 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="166748" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt;, 22 participants with Parkinson's dementia who received a high daily dose of ambroxol for a year showed no worsening of key &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.44.12.2308"&gt;neuropsychiatric symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 25 patients who received the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="166748" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; displayed worsening symptoms, gaining an average of 3.73 points on an &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/assessment/tools/neuropsychiatric-inventory"&gt;established neuropsychiatric score&lt;/a&gt;. Patients on ambroxol dropped an average of 2.45 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-might-not-start-in-the-brain-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Parkinson's Disease Might Not Start in The Brain, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups shared similar cognitive scores related to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-170991"&gt;memory and language&lt;/a&gt;. But those taking ambroxol showed stabilization in symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, irritability, apathy, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12020130"&gt;aberrant motor activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants on ambroxol also experienced fewer falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though ambroxol was found to be safe, no clinically meaningful improvements in cognition were recorded. Yet there are reasons to remain optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal was to change the course of Parkinson's dementia," &lt;a href="https://news.westernu.ca/2025/06/cough-syrup-parkinsons-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Stephen Pasternak from Western University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166759" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166759" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30-642x641.png" alt="Parkinson's Neuropsychiatric Symptoms" class="size-medium wp-image-166759" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30-642x641.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30-416x415.png 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30-600x599.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-Parkinsons-disease-Modified-from-Fredericks-et-al-30.png 727w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166759" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Sci. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the team's analysis, some participants carrying a high-risk &lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; gene for Parkinson's showed improved cognitive performance on ambroxol. With a small sample size and no control group to compare outcomes to, the authors caution these results need to be followed up before drawing any conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, high-risk &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GBA1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GBA1&lt;/em&gt; gene&lt;/a&gt; variants tend to result in lower activity of the enzyme &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocerebrosidase"&gt;Glucocerebrosidase&lt;/a&gt; (GCase), and this, in turn, is linked to more protein clumps in the brain, like Lewy bodies, which are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-isnt-the-only-form-of-dementia-an-expert-explains-the-differences"&gt;associated with Parkinson's dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.parkreldis.2021.02.003"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that ambroxol can significantly increase GCase activity. In the current trial, those taking the drug showed 1.5 times the amount of GCase activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No serious adverse effects were reported by those taking ambroxol, although mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues were common and caused a few participants to drop out of the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that some of the more serious symptoms of Parkinson's disease may be managed by ambroxol if taken regularly at high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because ambroxol can easily &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hsr.2023.100096"&gt;cross the blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists suspect the cough medicine &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drug-used-in-cough-syrup-for-decades-offers-new-hope-as-parkinson-s-treatment"&gt;can treat neurodegenerative conditions&lt;/a&gt;, like Parkinson's, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Gaucher disease, neuroinflammation, or spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that hypothesis proves to be true requires more clinical research. But the recent phase 2 trial on Parkinson's dementia gives scientists good reason to keep digging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest ambroxol may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk," &lt;a href="https://news.westernu.ca/2025/06/cough-syrup-parkinsons-dementia/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Pasternak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your blood pressure is the force of blood pushing through your arteries. Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The top number, systolic blood pressure, measures pressure when the heart beats. The bottom number, diastolic blood pressure, is the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The No. 1 thing to avoid if you have high blood pressure is underestimating the impact your nutrition habits can have on your levels. Knowing that you can make a big difference in your blood pressure by changing some aspects of your diet is positive and empowering news.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Actionable habits for lowering blood pressure include limiting sodium, eating fruits and vegetables that are rich in potassium, cooking more at home and following blood-pressure-lowering eating plans. “Getting a handle on your blood pressure requires behavior and lifestyle changes, which can take time, effort, consistency and patience,” says &lt;a href="https://physeq.com/personal-trainers-trainer-nyc/sarah-currie-personal-trainer-new-york-ny/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sarah Currie, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a personal trainer and co-owner of Physical Equilibrium in New York City. With that said, here are the impactful changes you can start making to your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cut Back on Sodium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over time, eating a high-sodium diet can narrow blood vessels and increase blood pressure. “You’d be surprised how many food items contain hidden sources of sodium,” says Fraga. Packaged foods are often packed with sodium, and some of the top culprits are canned soups, frozen meals and deli meat, adds Currie.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The American Heart Association suggests that cutting out 1,000 milligrams per day of sodium can have a beneficial impact on blood pressure. For people with high blood pressure, the AHA recommends consuming no more than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To reduce your sodium intake, try replacing a portion of salt in your recipes with garlic, fresh herbs and spices. Read package labels and restaurant menus before buying or ordering to help make lower-sodium choices. When you’re reading labels, look at the Daily Value percentage for sodium and aim for lower-sodium foods when possible. Foods with a sodium DV of 5% or less per serving are considered a low-sodium foods, while those with 20% DV or more of sodium per serving are considered high-sodium and should be limited.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Eat Potassium-Rich Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium counteracts sodium by helping your body excrete it through your urine. (In short, you pee it out.) The mineral also helps relax blood vessel walls, which lowers blood pressure. The AHA recommends consuming 3,500 to 5,000 milligrams of potassium daily to prevent or treat&lt;a href="https://www.health.com/high-blood-pressure-overview-7505223" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Boost your potassium intake by eating more fruits and vegetables. Aim to eat 4½ cups of fruits and vegetables every day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Foods rich in potassium include:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Lentils&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prunes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bananas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kidney beans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orange juice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cantaloupe&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Squash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apricots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soybeans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raisins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potatoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spinach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chicken breast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low-fat dairy products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cook More Meals at Home &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Restaurant meals are often high in sodium, which can make it difficult to stay within the recommended limits. One study found that the average sodium content in a fast-food meal was about 1,300 milligrams—nearly all of the recommended sodium limit for someone with high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Cooking at home gives you control over all the ingredients. Whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, dried legumes, unsalted nuts and seeds and fresh sources of protein contain little to no sodium. When cooking you can flavor foods with fresh and dried herbs and spices, including basil, oregano, cumin, rosemary, turmeric and more.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This doesn’t mean you can’t eat out—it just takes a little planning. If the restaurant provides nutrition information, check it ahead of time to plan out a meal that’s lower in sodium. Avoid or limit fried foods, which tend to be higher in sodium, says Currie, and ask for sauces and dressings on the side. Opt for baked, broiled, grilled or steamed proteins paired with green and other colorful vegetables. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Consider the DASH or Mediterranean Style of Eating   &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was created to intentionally treat high blood pressure. This eating style focuses on eating fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, low-fat or fat-free dairy, lean protein and limited saturated fats, red meat, added sugar and sodium. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/11624/dash-diet-meal-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; is rich in important nutrients that help lower blood pressure, including potassium, calcium, magnesium, fiber and protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/longform/8046714/a-new-mediterranean-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is very similar to the DASH eating plan, as it’s full of fresh fruits and vegetables, fiber-rich beans and whole grains, nuts and seeds. This eating plan also recommends limiting foods that contain higher amounts of saturated fat, such as red meat. One food that’s famously associated with the Mediterranean diet is extra-virgin olive oil, which is rich in polyphenols that can protect the heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Improving the quality of your diet is one effective way to manage hypertension. Other lifestyle factors that help bring down blood pressure include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If lifestyle factors are not enough to keep your blood pressure in a healthy range, you may need medication. Reach out to a health care provider for guidance.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure is a common condition affecting many Americans, yet, you can take steps to improve your numbers and prevent hypertension. One of the biggest mistakes people make is not realizing how important nutrition is for managing blood pressure and maintaining a healthy heart.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Small, consistent steps—like reading labels to cut down on sodium, cooking at home more often and eating plenty of fruits and vegetables—can make a big difference. For personalized support and guidance, ask a health care provider about working with a registered dietitian who can create an individualized eating plan and set goals that work for you.

			&lt;p&gt;For roughly one in every hundred people, food containing even the smallest amounts of gluten can deliver a gutful of hurt and pose severe risks to their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a domino effect of immunological reactions can be traced back to their &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/celiac-disease/genetic-testing-for-celiac-disease"&gt;genetic roots&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/evidence-emerges-that-a-viral-infection-could-be-behind-celiac-disease"&gt;number of contributing factors&lt;/a&gt; are also involved, making it difficult to map the precise chain of events that causes celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using transgenic mice, an international team led by scientists from McMaster University in Canada has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnuKJhhfBT8"&gt;identified a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; played by the very cells making up the gut's lining, describing a major stepping stone that could lead to new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease is a lifelong autoimmune disorder triggered by the presence of a group of structural proteins known as gluten in the intestines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gluten-food-list"&gt;Eating virtually anything&lt;/a&gt; made with wheat, barley, or rye – meaning most baked goods, breads, and pastas – puts &lt;a href="https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/symptoms-of-celiac-disease/"&gt;people with the condition&lt;/a&gt; at risk of transient symptoms like bloating, pain, diarrhea, constipation, and sometimes reflux and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gluten-intolerance-vs-celiac-disease-experts-reveal-the-key-differences?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Gluten Intolerance vs Celiac Disease: Experts Reveal The Key Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently the only way to avoid the symptoms is to avoid the foods that trigger them.

A new randomized, placebo-controlled trial published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-024-01278-7" target="_blank"&gt;Research on Child and Adolescent Psychopathology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reports that a 12-week course of two probiotic strains was linked to lower hyperactivity-impulsivity ratings in children aged five to nine and to modest gains in comfort-related quality-of-life scores among children with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder describes a set of lifelong developmental differences marked by persistent social-communication difficulties and a preference for repetitive or highly focused behaviours. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in contrast, is characterized by age-inappropriate levels of inattention, motor restlessness, and impulsive actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both conditions emerge early in life, show high rates of overlap, and often involve delays in executive functions that help a child plan, inhibit urges, and regulate emotions. Over recent years, researchers have turned their attention to the community of microbes that lives inside the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some intestinal bacteria can manufacture or modulate neurotransmitters such as dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, chemicals that also shape reward, movement, and self-control within the brain. If the mix of microbes differs in children with neurodevelopmental conditions, supplying strains that boost those messenger molecules could conceivably ease everyday symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine this possibility, a team of researchers in Spain conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 80 children aged 5 to 16 years. The study included 38 children diagnosed with ADHD and 42 children diagnosed with autism, some of whom had both diagnoses. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a daily probiotic supplement or a placebo for 12 weeks. The probiotic mixture contained two strains of bacteria—&lt;em&gt;Lactiplantibacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Levilactobacillus brevis&lt;/em&gt;—which are known to promote the synthesis of dopamine and GABA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the first dose and again after twelve weeks, parents completed standard rating scales that capture inattentive behaviours, hyperactivity-impulsivity, peer relations, and other challenges. For children with autism, parents also filled out the Social Responsiveness Scale, which gauges social awareness, communication, and repetitive patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each child took a computerized continuous-performance task that records omission errors (a sign of inattention) and commission errors (a sign of impulsivity). Parents answered questionnaires about executive function in everyday life, recorded their child’s sleep patterns, and judged five domains of health-related quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses included every child who started the trial, whether or not the family missed a few doses, reflecting real-world use. Across the whole sample, average scores on parent checklists and performance tasks shifted only slightly and did so to a similar degree in the probiotic and placebo groups. When the team separated the data by age, a clearer pattern emerged. Among children aged five to nine, parent ratings of hyperactivity-impulsivity fell more sharply in the probiotic condition than in the placebo condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference equaled a very large effect size in the autism group and a moderate-to-large effect size in the attention-deficit group. Within-group comparisons told a similar story: young recipients of the probiotic moved from the “elevated” into the “high-average” range on that subscale, while their peers on placebo showed no reliable change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance on the continuous-performance task largely mirrored those parent reports. Children with autism who swallowed the probiotic made fewer commission errors—an index of hurried responses—by the end of the study, whereas the placebo group showed a smaller drop. Detectability scores, which reflect how well a child can distinguish target from non-target stimuli, nudged upward only in the placebo arm. Reaction-time variability, a hallmark of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, was unchanged in both arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked beyond core symptoms, they found one additional glimmer of benefit. On the Child Health and Illness Profile, a broad inventory of perceived well-being, children with autism in the probiotic arm reported a higher sense of physical comfort—covering aches, energy, and stomach complaints—than they had at baseline, and the effect size again reached the large range. Sleep ratings, executive-function scores, and social-communication scales stayed level for most participants, regardless of the supplement they received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might a bacterial drink calm hyperactivity in younger children yet leave inattention untouched? One possibility is that the strains used in the trial release gamma-aminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that tempers motor activity. Earlier work shows lower gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in parts of the brain that coordinate movement and impulse control in both neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a probiotic raises the supply of that transmitter—either directly or by stimulating host cells to produce more—it could dampen fidgety behaviour without necessarily sharpening focus. Alternatively, the microbes could influence dopamine signalling, which plays out differently in circuits that support controlled attention versus those that regulate action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The modest scope of the changes tempers enthusiasm. The trial lasted only three months, a brief window in the long developmental arc of these conditions. The participating families were, on average, socially advantaged and reported few severe behaviour challenges, limiting room for improvement. The sample size—just over eighty—was sufficient to detect large effects but not the nuanced gains that might unfold in smaller subgroups, such as children with pronounced gastrointestinal complaints or those who do not respond well to medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the investigators did not profile each child’s gut microbiome before and after treatment, so it remains unclear whether the probiotic actually took hold and shifted microbial balance in a way that mattered to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies could address those gaps by enrolling larger cohorts across multiple clinics, extending the intervention to six months or a year, and adding stool sequencing to confirm bacterial colonisation and neurotransmitter output. Researchers might also explore whether combining probiotics with traditional behavioural therapies or with dietary fibre that feeds beneficial microbes produces a stronger signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trials that begin during infancy, before hyperactivity or social-communication problems are fully established, may reveal whether microbial support can alter developmental trajectories rather than merely quiet symptoms that have already appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the current findings are preliminary, they add weight to the idea that the gut-brain connection offers a promising, low-risk target for supporting children with neurodevelopmental differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-024-01278-7" target="_blank"&gt;Effect of Probiotics on the Symptomatology of Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children and Adolescents: Pilot Study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Meritxell Rojo-Marticella, Victoria Arija, and Josefa Canals-Sans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 22:04:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPVUhtZWt6Rk1famIta3pGaDBsWWhnb2pNNHJ3aWE1cm1nTXNHUnN2Y3VMdWhiV2NRRERHanBNOTVDQVRZdGF4b2t3UFRubFNIRG1MNHlveUVNZWpTLWJSMldHVEVVLTFXamE0dU5IX0J6c2ZqSy02a0tycTdWSFp5V0tneUZvWUR1N2lZTHI5MlNidl9nSXpZTlFyUmxaaHJ2a0RwYnJUa0FpUE5WTUo1dGZKcVM</guid></item><item><title>遵循这种饮食可以降低您患阿尔茨海默氏症的风险，无论您的年龄如何- SciTechDaily | Following This Diet Can Reduce Your Risk of Alzheimer’s, No Matter Your Age - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOeXNaa2RybE5GSUdUQUFzM2llUUFvRGwzenZfSUZSeGpsSHNRTlNIYkFJWjgyS0tGZHI4Vl9QaUt3VWduZ3BTQ3U2aDFpelNhX29wNmxUNFFGbzJkUXFGTGp0c0J1Y19BNlQyRlBsU3RDS1VlYXBDT0Q2Z3hRU2R0bHVDb09QOHlaLUt5d1MyQWJETDZNZWEyTDItRzdJMWlJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 21:54:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxOeXNaa2RybE5GSUdUQUFzM2llUUFvRGwzenZfSUZSeGpsSHNRTlNIYkFJWjgyS0tGZHI4Vl9QaUt3VWduZ3BTQ3U2aDFpelNhX29wNmxUNFFGbzJkUXFGTGp0c0J1Y19BNlQyRlBsU3RDS1VlYXBDT0Q2Z3hRU2R0bHVDb09QOHlaLUt5d1MyQWJETDZNZWEyTDItRzdJMWlJ</guid></item><item><title>专家为何关注RFK Jr. - NPR引用的疫苗研究 | Why experts are concerned about the vaccine study cited by RFK Jr. - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNaWlHMXVSX3VOQm9xZEozZ0VuYzF2QkM4ZGZHb1hlT2VKUzhtN1kwdk96Z0d4X0VQOTE4TzJxeVRWUm11VVJPVmZheTZieFFvd1hTNnhnRXdHMHlZaHIwYUJaSktlZy1QckI0bDN2Tm9tcEc5SGpSX1NRVW5xSlQ4OVE2VDRSbjNJMkFNanBTQnhDaXA3YTg0dl9iYl9udi1NcDJ5em03LURUZWNGOXRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Trump administration has cut many global health programs. One cut stands out to some experts. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance provides immunizations for some of the world's poorest children. It won't be getting over a billion dollars in promised U.S. funding. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says Gavi doesn't consider vaccine safety. NPR's Gabrielle Emanuel reports this stunned the global health world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GABRIELLE EMANUEL, BYLINE: And what angered many of them was the reason he gave for attacking the organization's safety record. RFK Jr. singled out a study from 2017. He called it a landmark study that he says proves one of the world's most common vaccines could be dangerous. He delivered his remarks in a video to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROBERT F KENNEDY JR: The authors of this study were five internationally revered deities of vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: One of those authors is a researcher named Christine Stabell Benn. She looked at the DTP vaccine that's given to the vast majority of the world's children. It protects them against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis. Stabell Benn says it's good at protecting them against these three deadly diseases, but...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTINE STABELL BENN: We started doing what nobody else had done before us. We evaluated the effect of vaccines on overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: Overall health, meaning, could this vaccine maybe make you more likely to die of other causes? To find out, Stabell Benn and her team looked through health records for about a thousand kids. The records came from the early '80s in the West African country of Guinea-Bissau. Stabell Benn didn't respond to interview requests, but here she is speaking at a TEDx Talk from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STABELL BENN: And the results were scary. Children who received DTP vaccine had five times higher risk of dying than those who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: A scary thought, yes, but outside researchers like Beate Kampmann aren't buying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEATE KAMPMANN: It's just false news, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: She's at the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine. She has a long list of concerns about the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KAMPMANN: That study is based on ancient data. It is an observation study. Statistics are dodgy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: And, Kampmann says, a few years later, those same researchers themselves repeated the study and found totally different results. The kids who got the DTP vaccine this time were not more likely to die. Kampmann says, on top of all this, that original study isn't even relevant because the DTP vaccines given today are different than the shots given in the '80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KAMPMANN: The recipe has changed, and the whole production of the process is different as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: Kampmann's not the only one who is skeptical. The World Health Organization has brought together independent panels of experts to investigate this issue. As a result, new studies were commissioned, and multiple times over the past 20 years the panels have concluded the current recommendation - that everyone gets a DTP vaccine - is the right one. Kate O'Brien is the WHO's top vaccine expert. She says billions of people have received the DTP vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KATE O'BRIEN: This vaccine has been used for over 50 years. We have decades and decades of safety information on DTP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: If this vaccine is not given, she says...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'BRIEN: We will cause harm. It will result in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: NPR sent HHS a list of concerns raised by outside vaccinologists. The HHS spokesperson did not respond to the concerns but said Gavi must re-earn public trust. Many in the medical establishment have condemned the U.S. for pulling its funding for global vaccination efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAUL OFFIT: It's just a travesty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: Paul Offit directs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OFFIT: There is probably no better public health organization, and, frankly, more economical public health organization, than Gavi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMANUEL: He says RFK Jr. used shoddy evidence to make a big decision.

This research is complicated by the onslaught of pathogens that came to the Americas during that era and the difficulty of determining a diagnosis from ancient DNA, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ancient-dna-and-modern-genomes-can-reveal-stories-of-past-peoples-from-the-iron-age-to-chernobyl-geneticist-says" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/ancient-dna-and-modern-genomes-can-reveal-stories-of-past-peoples-from-the-iron-age-to-chernobyl-geneticist-says"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ancient DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has become a great tool that allows us to dig deeper into diseases that have had a long history in the Americas," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://kirstenbos.ca/" target="_blank" data-url="https://kirstenbos.ca/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kirsten Bos&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular paleopathologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and co-author of the study, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="we-were-initially-suspicious-3"&gt;"We were initially suspicious"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis &lt;/em&gt;genome from the Chilean bones had "amazing preservation, which is uncommon in ancient DNA, especially from specimens of that age," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.lesleysitter.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.lesleysitter.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lesley Sitter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a computational biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and co-author of the study, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After isolating the DNA of the pathogen, "we were initially suspicious, since leprosy is regarded as a colonial-era disease," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OXEgPlcAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" data-url="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OXEgPlcAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Darío Ramirez&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a doctoral candidate of biological anthropology at the National University of Córdoba in Argentina, said in the statement. With further scrutiny, the team confirmed that they were indeed looking at evidence of leprosy caused by a type of bacteria that's considered rare in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding is significant, but not conclusive enough to determine if the disease originated in the Americas, Bos said. "So far the evidence points in the direction of an American origin, but we'll need more genomes from other time periods and contexts to be sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work also helps to answer another major question: how did leprosy spread across such vast regions of the Americas? One idea is that the pathogen arose during an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/the-1st-americans-were-not-who-we-thought-they-were" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/the-1st-americans-were-not-who-we-thought-they-were"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early peopling event in the Americas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Or, perhaps the pathogen was already in the Americas in an animal reservoir, and then it was contracted by people, the researchers wrote in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists still don't fully understand how the leprosy-causing bacteria spread, but their presence in such far corners of the world suggests there are environmental or animal factors responsible for transmission, Avanzi explained. "Identifying the origin and possible non-human reservoirs of &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; is crucial for improving prevention and control strategies, both for human health and wildlife conservation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study complements &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7144" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu7144" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Avanzi and her team, which analyzed more recent remains from Canada and Argentina and also discovered evidence that &lt;em&gt;M. lepromatosis&lt;/em&gt; was dispersed across the Americas before European colonialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cognitive lapses aren’t always linked to aging or dementia. Factors like stress, anxiety, and multitasking can mimic or contribute. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporating brain-healthy foods, staying physically active and engaging in mentally stimulating activities are ways to slow cognitive decline. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early consultation with a healthcare professional is crucial for proper diagnosis and intervention. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It happens from time to time: You start telling a story, only to lose your train of thought halfway through. Or you walk into a room and can't remember what you went in there to do. Mental glitches like these happen to everyone and are understandably scary, but aren't necessarily a sign of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009483/americans-adults-dementia-study-ways-to-reduce-your-risk/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. "The feeling of your brain short-circuiting is often more likely due to psychological processes," says &lt;a href="https://www.stetson.edu/software/greenpages/index.php?q=Department%20of%20Psychology&amp;amp;c=d" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Sarah Garcia-Beaumier, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt; Increases in stress, distractions, multitasking, anxiety or depression can be contributors. "A common consideration we have to make clinically is whether cognitive symptoms are due to early dementia, or rather due to a depressive or anxiety disorder," Garcia-Beaumier says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-cognitive-lapses-vs-cognitive-decline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Cognitive Lapses vs. Cognitive Decline  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cognitive decline typically involves a worsening of performance in areas such as memory, attention or language.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Common signs include forgetting to call someone or struggling to recall the right word. When those symptoms appear much more than they did previously, so much so that others are starting to notice, "that's typically an early red flag for cognitive decline beyond what we expect for the normal aging process," says Garcia-Beaumier. Normal aging may cause minor delays in memory retrieval, like struggling to remember a name but recalling it later. These are not signs of dementia or cognitive impairment, per Thomas Hammond, M.D. "Forgetting conversations or important appointments, or feeling lost in familiar places, are more worrisome and concerning for significant early cognitive impairment,” Hammond explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Garcia-Beaumier notes that some individuals with mild cognitive impairment may stabilize or improve over time. Still, unresolved psychological distress or untreated health issues could increase the risk of dementia, making it crucial to address potential warning signs early.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-common-signs-of-cognitive-decline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Common Signs of Cognitive Decline  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The corticolimbic system of the brain modulates the experience of anxiety.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "It also happens to be the same area of the brain that helps with processing speed, attention, planning, judgment, organization and lots of thinking skills," says Garcia-Beaumier. "So if there's a change in this area of the brain due to stress or anxiety, these cognitive skills are also affected."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This overlap in brain pathways, along with the larger amount of resources devoted to modulating your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt; and anxiety due to your body constantly shifting between survival and recuperation mode, will lead to a varying array of cognitive deficits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These pathways are also crucial in processing information—if you can no longer pay attention to things, your brain isn't going to be able to encode them and retain them for later memory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cognitive decline manifests itself in almost all aspects of complex daily tasks, especially our language. "Even a simple undertaking, like naming a kitchen appliance, engages our brain networks extensively, making it a sensitive indicator of early decline," says &lt;a href="https://movmntmethod.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Aubry Alvarez-Bakker, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A strong sign can be found in moments when you might forget a simple, specific word you're looking for, so you try to describe it instead. Over time, you might also start having difficulty keeping up with conversations, which can lead to anxiety in social situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The specific mechanism behind why this happens isn't fully known, but research shows that language decline often originates in the left side of the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "We also know that low BDNF production (a protein produced by our nervous system that's crucial for the production of new brain cells) means fewer new cells to help us carry on activity across our brain," says Alvarez-Bakker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we age, production of this protein naturally declines, so our body relies heavily on our environment to create BDNF to "fertilize" our brain and allow new cells to form. "Among the best foods to consume to boost BDNF in our body—and subsequently ward off cognitive decline—are blueberries, turmeric, green tea and dark chocolate," says Alvarez-Bakker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because apathy is a common symptom of severe burnout, it's easy to pay no mind that it can also be a symptom of cognitive decline. "It's actually the most common symptom and perhaps the most overlooked," says Alvarez-Bakker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A sudden loss of interest in activities you used to love, or a willingness to throw in the towel easily, is a common symptom of dementia. You might lose interest in reading books, gardening or many other activities you used to enjoy. You might also find things that used to be easy for you to accomplish are now overwhelming, or that you avoid complex tasks or projects entirely.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This is unfortunate because withdrawing from stimulation is known to speed up the decline process," says Alvarez-Bakker. "Luckily, our lifestyle can help counteract this symptom to an extent." When apathy creeps in, the best step to take is to get personal by integrating things you deeply enjoy—music, art, sports, reminiscing—into daily activities that will boost your participation in life, and in turn, stimulation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 4. You've been acting out of character.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Subtle personality changes are an often-missed sign of cognitive decline, primarily because of how easily they can be blamed on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/early-adulthood-inflammation-may-influence-cognition-in-midlife-8676000" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; (say, becoming easily angered or swearing when that isn't a regular part of your vocabulary).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might also find yourself withdrawing from social interactions and activities—and when you are around others, you may not participate in discussions, but instead stay quiet. "These are symptoms which are often written off as an individual being shy," says Hammond. "However, the person who was once talkative and garrulous will often become quiet and a wallflower as an early sign of developing cognitive decline."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Regardless if stress is the cause or a variable that's augmenting the cognitive decline, "any treatment hoping to prevent or reduce cognitive decline needs to incorporate stress management," says, &lt;a href="https://www.dncneurology.com/isaac-tourgeman" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Isaac Tourgeman, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 5. You're always ruminating and worrying.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incessantly ruminating and worrying keeps your fight-or-flight response in overdrive, and symptoms of chronic stress can mimic cognitive decline, such as forgetfulness and inattention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Uncontrolled, toxic thinking has the potential to create a state of low-grade inflammation across the brain and body over time, which can impact our cognitive health and ability to remember or recall information," says &lt;a href="https://drleaf.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Caroline Leaf, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "If left unmanaged, this kind of chronic cognitive upset can progress into varying levels of cognitive decline."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Resolution of the underlying causes of your rumination and worry is paramount to improving current and preventing future symptoms of cognitive decline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 6. You've recently been sick or have a chronic condition.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Cognitive dulling is a common feature associated with general medical illnesses, such as the flu, urinary tract infection and gastroenteritis," says Hammond. "Metabolic stress caused by minor infection will often lead to a transient cognitive decline," Hammond added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other conditions can also lead to cognitive decline, including sleep disorders (such as sleep apnea).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Similar to psychological distress, sometimes symptoms can be resolved if it's due to one of these conditions," says Garcia-Beaumier. "But if left untreated, it does increase a person's risk of dementia down the line."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depression can result in what's called pseudodementia, where depression essentially masquerades as cognitive impairment.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Symptoms present as forgetfulness, difficulty with attention and lowered energy and motivation," says Tourgeman. This is when it's especially important to consult with your doctor to ensure the right diagnosis is made and proper treatment given.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 7. Other people are noticing your mental glitches.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We all experience cognitive glitches to a certain extent when going through the pressures of life, but a good rule of thumb is if anyone who knows you has noticed a consistent increase of these symptoms over time, it may be a sign that you're experiencing cognitive decline," says Leaf. Usually the person experiencing symptoms is the last to be aware of the decline, so it's important to be open to feedback and proactive about taking action.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "While we currently aren't able to change our genes, we can influence how our environment impacts them," says Tourgeman. "A healthy lifestyle—eating a brain-healthy diet (like the MIND Diet), exercising regularly, reducing stress and distractions, maintaining a sense of utility and connectedness—can all go a long way."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And no healthy lifestyle with the goal of avoiding or improving cognitive decline would be complete without a wide range of activities that keep your brain engaged.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"Playing brain games on your phone will only go so far, though, mostly because you'll only get really good at that one thing," says Garcia-Beaumier. "Doing lots of activities that you enjoy and that challenge you is best." Things like reading, playing games, learning new skills and dancing can all contribute to optimal cognitive health when done in conjunction with other healthy habits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-know-when-its-time-to-see-a-healthcare-provider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Know When It's Time to See a Healthcare Provider  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Any time someone notices cognitive changes, such as memory not being as good or the brain feeling slower or foggy, they should check in with their doctor," says Garcia-Beaumier. "But it's especially important if family or friends are also noticing issues or if the issues make it hard to fulfill daily responsibilities."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can try to work on decreasing stress and improving how you take care of any other health conditions to see if that also clears up any cognitive issues, but there isn't a definitive way to know whether your symptoms are due to stress, psychological issues, another health condition or cognitive decline without talking to a healthcare provider and possibly seeing specialists for further testing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_69-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Even getting some basic tests, early before any issues arise, can allow your doctor to compare your current cognitive performance to possible cognitive issues in the future," says Garcia-Beaumier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_70-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_71-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_72-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The occasional mental lapse, like misplacing your keys or forgetting the name of a person you just met, is a normal part of life and not necessarily a cause for concern. These fleeting moments of forgetfulness are often tied to stress, lack of sleep, or even simply being preoccupied with too many things at once. However, when these cognitive issues become consistent, noticeable to others and begin to interfere with daily life, they may signal something more significant, such as cognitive decline. Taking proactive steps to manage stress, maintain overall health, and engage in stimulating mental and physical activities can help you protect your brain's function and resilience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_74-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Understanding the difference between normal cognitive aging and more concerning symptoms is key to addressing issues early on. Consult a healthcare professional if you or those close to you observe persistent changes in memory, attention, or overall behavior. Seeking support and adopting lifestyle habits that prioritize brain health can not only slow potential decline but also improve your quality of life. By staying informed and proactive, you give yourself the best chance at maintaining your cognitive health and vitality for years to come.&lt;br&gt;

His wife immediately called 911 and the 61-year-old was rushed to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Montalvo said: 'Everything started spinning. I went to stand up, and I fell. I just didn't understand what was going on. I couldn't understand it. I didn't know why I was feeling that way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next thing he knew, the retired New York cop &lt;span&gt;woke up to the sound of concerned whispers from family and doctors, murmuring about a '15 percent percent chance of survival.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It turns out, Montalvo was having an ischemic stroke, which occurs when a clot restricts blood flow to the brain and deprives it of oxygen. This can lead to death or life-long disabilities, as stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the US. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Signs of an ischemic stroke - which account for 87 percent of all strokes - include some symptoms Montalvo was experiencing: sudden weakness or numbness, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, vision problems, severe headache, dizziness and loss of coordination. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the US, someone has a stroke every 40 seconds - about 795,000 people a year - and every three minutes, a person dies from a stroke, the CDC reports. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Montalvo added: 'I was like "Oh my God, I'm going to die. I don't even have a chance to say goodbye to anybody."' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nestor Montalvo (third from the right) suffered a stroke in September 2024 at 61 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Montalvo was having a stroke, he thought: 'Oh my God, I'm going to die. I don't even have a chance to say goodbye to anybody'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When a stroke occurs, 'time is brain,' Dr Taylor Kimberley, chief of neurocritical care at Massachusetts General Hospital, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/headache-stroke-recovery-rehabilitation-catholic-mercy-health/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;CBS. She was not involved in Montalvo's case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means the faster a person can receive treatment can make all the difference in avoiding brain damage. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the worse the damage can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Montalvo arrived at Catholic Health's Mercy Hospital in Nassau, Long Island, in September 2024, his symptoms immediately triggered a stroke protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once blood flow during a stroke is stopped, cells immediately start to die in major tissues, such as the cerebellum and brain stem, both of which regulate coordination and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Premier Neurology, anywhere from seven to 65 percent of people having a stroke will experience some form of a headache. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In less than 10 minutes after arrival, Montalvo was assessed as a potential stroke patient, and five minutes later was hurried into a CT scan to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors then administered a clot-busting medication called TNK, and Montalvo underwent a minor procedure to ensure the clot had been broken up and would not reoccur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the initial procedure, Montalvo remained critical as his vocal chords stopped working and he underwent a tracheostomy - a surgery in which an opening is made in the throat and a tube is inserted to help with breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He couldn't talk or swallow for a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Montalvo underwent rigorous speech therapy to strengthen his throat in order to be able to speak again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the following six weeks, Montalvo underwent an hour of speech therapy a day and did exercises to strengthen muscles in the mouth and throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When his tracheostomy tube was finally removed, he underwent three more procedures to repair his throat and was eventually able to enjoy a Thanksgiving meal with his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, nearly a year later, life for Montalvo is returning somewhat back to normal, although he continues to use a cane to walk and have outpatient treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He hopes to further his progress, however, telling CBS that recovering was harder than getting through the stroke itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'You take life for granted, and then when something like this happens, it wakes you up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You hear people talk about it, and it just sounds like it's not going to happen to you. All of a sudden, it happens to you.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers analyzed 17 studies with 3,705 participants, finding that while maltreatment did not generally impair interoception, emotional maltreatment was strongly tied to lower body trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diminished trust may impair emotional regulation, stress response, and self-care, increasing vulnerability to mental disorders. The findings underscore the urgent need to recognize and address the invisible harms of emotional abuse and neglect in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body Trust Eroded:&lt;/strong&gt; Emotional abuse and neglect are linked to reduced confidence in interpreting bodily signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mental Health Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Impaired body trust may contribute to anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Emotional maltreatment remains under-recognized compared to physical and sexual abuse.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;TUD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“My heart skipped a beat” — a phrase familiar to anyone who’s ever received unexpected news — illustrates how bodily sensations are tied to our emotional experiences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychology describes the underlying phenomenon as interoception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the ability to perceive and interpret internal body signals such as heartbeat, breathing or stomach activity. This ability plays a central role in emotions, stress regulation and physical well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In science, the development and significance of interoception is still poorly understood. However, increasing evidence suggests that it is an important common risk factor for both mental and somatic disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at the Chair of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology at TU Dresden led by Prof. Anna-Lena Zietlow, has now conducted a meta-analysis of scientific studies to investigate whether there is a link between child maltreatment and interoception and which types of child maltreatment are particularly strongly associated with it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from 17 studies with a total of 3,705 participants. While no general link was found between child maltreatment and internal body perception, a link was found between maltreatment experiences and reduced body trust. This link was particularly strong for emotional abuse and neglect.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First author Julia Ditzer explains: “Our results show that people who have experienced emotional abuse or emotional neglect in their childhood often report less trust in their own bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This can have far-reaching effects on mental health, as it can impair emotion regulation, perception of one’s own needs and stress processing, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could be one explanation for why those affected by abuse and maltreatment are at increased risk of developing mental disorders such as anxiety disorders, depression, eating disorders or somatoform disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Ilka Böhm, team member in the Zietlow lab, adds: “Despite the long-term consequences, these forms of child maltreatment have not yet been given the attention they deserve. Unlike physical or sexual abuse, they are less visible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Dr Anna-Lena Zietlow emphasizes: “We hope that our research will help to raise public and professional awareness of emotional abuse and neglect. Children need not only protection from physical violence, but also reliable and sensitive emotional care. Their emotional needs should be given much more attention, both in society and in research and preventive measures.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the results of the meta-analysis, the team is now conducting a study on the correlation between child maltreatment and interoception in adolescents aged 12–17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#314143544242544245545d5d547145441c5543544255545f1f5554" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Magdalena Selbig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tu-dresden.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Magdalena Selbig – TUD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44220-025-00456-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A meta-analytic review of child maltreatment and interoception&lt;/a&gt;” by Julia Ditzer et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A meta-analytic review of child maltreatment and interoception&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interoception—the ability to sense internal bodily signals such as heartbeat or breathing—plays a central role in both mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruptions in interoception are increasingly recognized as important contributors to various psychological and medical conditions, yet the origins remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possible risk factor is exposure to childhood maltreatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we present a meta-analytic review examining the association between child maltreatment and different aspects of interoception. In this&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis, we use meta-analytic methods to examine the relationship between childhood maltreatment and interoception across 17 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found no consistent association between childhood maltreatment and interoceptive accuracy, sensibility, or awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a history of childhood maltreatment—particularly emotional maltreatment—was associated with lower body trust, a dimension of interoception reflecting confidence in bodily signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that early adverse experiences may undermine the foundational sense of trust in one’s body, with potential long-term consequences for mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 19:37:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1RSVJkRzloUmtGckJuOXdpYTVWWl8zWkIwRndBYmxXaDdPLUxaRktEcnZmQkNkaF9BTVFPRVRZS2FLakF2UnJnVURmYU1BcXZhVFduNHFWcUljOGRTeVY4OHJobEU5c1JNQ1Btb2RkMA</guid></item><item><title>这种被忽视的活动可以将您的痴呆风险降低高达69 ％ - Money Talks News | This Overlooked Activity Could Slash Your Dementia Risk by up to 69% - Money Talks News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNUxlMkN0MF9VdnFYcFNua2pVMnZQVi00Y2g5WjhnZ21wS0JUOGpDUzV1aklKbm0wb2pCNkdhcUJpMkdkRWpxMXpqQkxraGtORHB2TU1SMzVaWHExMFViTWJvZ2lpdTI0ckRWMnVKajVyczFNRTI5Ny1LSGJwZ0pDTC1hS3ktMndNQm91SVNHTE1jZ3I2SlltREllV2U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Money Talks News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 19:28:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNUxlMkN0MF9VdnFYcFNua2pVMnZQVi00Y2g5WjhnZ21wS0JUOGpDUzV1aklKbm0wb2pCNkdhcUJpMkdkRWpxMXpqQkxraGtORHB2TU1SMzVaWHExMFViTWJvZ2lpdTI0ckRWMnVKajVyczFNRTI5Ny1LSGJwZ0pDTC1hS3ktMndNQm91SVNHTE1jZ3I2SlltREllV2U</guid></item><item><title>晚进食与葡萄糖代谢受损有关- Medical Xpress | Late eating is associated with impaired glucose metabolism - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxOel9hbmdPa0FJMGlnVThMWlVYVllTUXRaWmwyS0lrWHBpVEwxX2N1bms3ZGF5SUc1dkt2S0pGS2ZnWlRtd1pLcGVsNFBFeHVtUUdnVVNjSmxfQlNKQXM0X3VSck1hRFNkbG82cS1qUzc2RG1zbnFIZ29iVTJKZ2VaUHVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our metabolic processes differ depending on the time of day and many of them are more active in the morning than in the evening. Although studies show that eating late in the day is associated with an increased risk of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, little is known about how the time we eat affects glucose metabolism and to what extent this is genetically defined.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Prof. Olga Ramich from the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbrücke (DIfE) and her team recently investigated this using data from a twin cohort from 2009–10. Their article was &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352396425001811" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;eBioMedicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/circadian+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;circadian system&lt;/a&gt; is a hierarchically structured 24-hour time control system in the body that regulates behavior and metabolism via a central clock in the brain and peripheral clocks in organs such as the liver or pancreas. As a result, our &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+processes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic processes&lt;/a&gt; differ depending on the time when we eat, which leads to diurnal fluctuations in glucose metabolism and the release of hormones after a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food intake itself acts as an important timer that synchronizes our internal clocks. Decoupling meal times from the natural light-dark rhythm, e.g., when working at night, can lead to an internal clock disorder and negative metabolic changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does late eating make you ill?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that eating late at night is associated with an increased risk of obesity and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, little is known about how exactly the timing of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/food+intake/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;food intake&lt;/a&gt; interacts with the individual circadian rhythm and thus influences &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glucose+metabolism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glucose metabolism&lt;/a&gt; and the risk of diabetes. It is also unclear which mechanisms determine one's individual eating behavior, as it depends on the interaction of cultural, personal, physiological and genetic factors.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Circadian timing of eating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone eats during the course of a day in relation to the individual biological daily rhythm is measured as the interval between mealtime and the midpoint of sleep. The midpoint of sleep describes the time that lies exactly in the middle between falling asleep and waking up. It is a measure of the chronotype—in other words, whether someone is an early riser or a night owl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nutrigenomics analysis in twins (NUGAT) study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NUGAT study, initiated and designed by Prof. Andreas F. H. Pfeiffer, was conducted from 2009 to 2010 at the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbrücke (DIfE). The identical and fraternal twin pairs were recruited either from a twin register (HealthTwiSt, Berlin, Germany) or via public advertisements. The 92 participants (46 pairs of twins) underwent two nutritional interventions, which were not relevant to the study results shown here though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants underwent detailed metabolic phenotyping, which included a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+examination/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical examination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/medical+history/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical history&lt;/a&gt;, anthropometric measurements and a glucose tolerance test. The individual chronotype was determined by means of a questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, all 92 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/test+subjects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;test subjects&lt;/a&gt; filled out handwritten food logs in which they noted the start and end of each meal as well as the amount and type of food consumed on five consecutive days. This included three working days and two days off to reflect the eating habits of the twin pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

The Fordham Tick Index, which monitors tick activity in southern New York, Connecticut and Northern New Jersey, currently rates the bite risk as "very high" – 9 out of 10 on its scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC reports that climate change may be contributing to the increasing numbers. In regions where Lyme disease is already present, milder winters result in fewer disease-carrying ticks dying during cold months, the agency notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to CDC data, May typically marks the annual peak for tick-bite emergencies. These rising numbers have prompted health officials to remind the public about the dangers posed by these tiny insects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC warns that ticks can transmit various diseases through their bites, many of which share similar symptoms. Most people who visit emergency rooms report fever and chills, headaches, fatigue and muscle aches. Some patients also develop distinctive rashes, particularly those associated with Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;With outdoor activities in full swing this summer, the CDC has issued several recommendations to prevent illness.

&lt;p&gt;Such is the case in Gaines County, Texas, where the largest outbreak this year has erupted. So far, that outbreak, which spans four states, accounts for at least 950 of the country's 1,281 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, overall, there have been a whopping 27 outbreaks in the country just in the first six months. According to national &lt;a href="https://campushealth.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2025-07/YSPH%20VMOC%20Special%20Report%20-%20Measles%20Outbreak%20%20Southwest%20US%207-6-2025.pdf"&gt;data compiled by researchers at Yale School of Public Health, as of July 6&lt;/a&gt;, the 1,281 cases are across 39 states, with around 90 percent of the cases associated with one of the outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reports a national measles case count but only updates its numbers on Wednesdays. According to the CDC's latest data, at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;155 people have been hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; for the infection, and three people have died—two otherwise healthy young children in Texas and one adult in New Mexico. All three deaths were in people who were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, most of the cases in the country are in unvaccinated children and teens. About 28 percent of cases are under the age of 5 and about 37 percent are ages 5 to 19. Of all the cases, 92 percent were in people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists have believed that inflammation inevitably increases with age, quietly fuelling diseases like &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24833586/"&gt;heart disease, dementia and diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00888-0"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; of Indigenous populations challenges that idea and could reshape how we think about ageing itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists have identified chronic low-level inflammation – called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10911963/"&gt;"inflammaging"&lt;/a&gt; – as one of the primary drivers of age-related diseases. Think of it as your body's immune system stuck in overdrive – constantly fighting battles that don't exist, gradually wearing down organs and systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But inflammaging might not be a universal feature of ageing after all. Instead, it could be a byproduct of how we live in modern society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, compared patterns of inflammation in four very different communities around the world. Two groups were from modern, industrialised societies – older adults living in Italy and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-age-faster-at-2-specific-times-in-their-life-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Humans Age Faster at 2 Specific Times in Their Life, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other two were Indigenous communities who live more traditional lifestyles: the Tsimane people of the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli in the forests of Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed blood samples from more than 2,800 people, looking at a wide range of inflammatory molecules, known as cytokines. Their goal was to find out whether a pattern seen in earlier studies – where certain signs of inflammation rise with age and are linked to disease – also appears in other parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, it turns out, is both yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the Italian and Singaporean participants, the researchers found a fairly &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-319-99375-1"&gt;consistent inflammaging pattern&lt;/a&gt;. As people aged, levels of inflammatory markers in the blood, such as C-reactive protein and tumour necrosis factor, rose together. Higher levels were linked to a greater risk of chronic diseases including kidney disease and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the Tsimane and Orang Asli populations, the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33100820/"&gt;inflammaging pattern was absent&lt;/a&gt;. The same inflammatory molecules did not rise consistently with age, and they were not strongly linked to age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, among the Tsimane, who face high rates of infections from parasites and other pathogens, inflammation levels were often elevated. Yet this &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30752-3/abstract"&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt; lead to the same rates of chronic diseases that are common in industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite high inflammatory markers, the Tsimane experience very low rates of conditions such as heart disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="166946" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inflammaging may not be universal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results raise important questions. One possibility is that inflammaging, at least as measured through these blood signals, is not a universal biological feature of ageing. Instead, it may arise in societies marked by high-calorie diets, low physical activity and reduced exposure to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166953" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166953" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642.jpg" alt="burgers and chips" class="wp-image-166953 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/high_cal_diet_inflammaging_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166953" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;High calorie, western-style diets could be responsible for aging-related inflammation. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADFEZbXxU4/"&gt;ksenee/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, chronic inflammation linked to ageing and disease might not simply result from an inevitable biological process, but rather from a mismatch between our ancient physiology and the modern environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that in communities with more traditional lifestyles – where people are more active, eat differently and are exposed to more infections – the immune system may work in a different way. In these groups, higher levels of inflammation might be a normal, healthy response to their environment, rather than a sign that the body is breaking down with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that inflammaging may still occur in all humans, but it might appear in different ways that are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35246947/"&gt;not captured by measuring inflammatory molecules&lt;/a&gt; in the blood. It could be happening at a cellular or tissue level, where it remains invisible to the blood tests used in this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these findings are confirmed, they could have significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they challenge how we diagnose and treat chronic inflammation in ageing. Biomarkers used to define inflammaging in European or Asian populations might not apply in other settings, or even among all groups within industrialised nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_166956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-166956" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642.jpg" alt="elderly thai man" class="wp-image-166956 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/old_people_inflammaging_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-166956" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Biomarkers the define aging in some populations might not apply to others. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFEPL3pTdA/"&gt;Sorapong's Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, they suggest that lifestyle interventions aimed at lowering chronic inflammation, such as exercise, changes in diet, or drugs targeting specific inflammatory molecules, might have different effects in different populations. What works for people living in cities might be unnecessary, or even ineffective, in those living traditional lifestyles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, this research serves as an important reminder that much of our knowledge about human health and ageing comes from studies conducted in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28429567/"&gt;wealthy, industrialised nations&lt;/a&gt;. Findings from these groups cannot automatically be assumed to apply worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are clear: this study is just the beginning. They urge scientists to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00082-y"&gt;dig deeper&lt;/a&gt;, using new tools that can detect inflammation not just in the blood, but within tissues and cells where the real story of ageing may be unfolding. Just as important, they call for more inclusive research that spans the full range of human experience, not just the wealthy, urbanised corners of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very least, this study offers an important lesson. What we thought was a &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317232120"&gt;universal truth about the biology of ageing&lt;/a&gt; might instead be a local story, shaped by our environment, lifestyle and the way we live.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260322/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

At least three people have died from the illness, and 155 others were in hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A vast majority of the measles cases - 92% - were in people who were either unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, according to the Centres for Disease Control (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The worst hit state is Texas, CDC data shows, where more than 700 cases have been reported. Other states with dozens of cases include Kansas and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health officials say that measles spread is occurring mostly in neighbourhoods where vaccination rates are lower, such as Mennonite communities in Texas that opt out of modern medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The outbreak comes as anti-vaccine sentiment in the US and elsewhere has grown in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr had previously spread misinformation about childhood vaccinations and had minimised the outbreak. He later endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine as illness spread, saying in a post on X that it is "the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles cases in the US were at their highest in recent memory in 1990, with nearly 28,000 reported infections, according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The illness was later declared eliminated around the year 2000, when cases sharply declined to less than 90 thanks to high vaccination rates and rapid outbreak response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases started ticking up slightly in 2014 and again in 2019, when 1,274 confirmed infections were reported. But cases in 2025 have just surpassed that figure, with 1,277 infections now reported across the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Public health experts have said that the US will lose measles elimination status if there is continued spread of measles at the current rate for more than 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a result of the current outbreak, more people are now getting the measles vaccine in the US. Between 1 January and 16 March, Texas gave at least 173, 000 measles doses compared to 158,000 in the same time period last year, state health department data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off the dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Large measles outbreaks have been reported recently in other countries, including the UK. Last year marked the highest number of confirmed measles cases reported in England since 2012 at nearly 3,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Since January of this year, there had been 529 cases reported in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada is also experiencing a measles outbreak, with more than 3,000 cases reported in 2025 so far.

Dr Alok Chopra, cardiologist and functional medicine expert defined the alternative as allulose, which is 70% as sweet as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Allulose is a rare sugar alternative that doesn't spike blood sugar or insulin levels, making it a promising option for those managing diabetes or insulin resistance," shared the doctor on Instagram. Additionally, he added that 70% of allulose is absorbed in the blood and passes out in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27679104" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="benefits-of-allulose" source="keywords"&gt;benefits of allulose&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor even mentioned the benefits of consuming allulose:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Low calories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: With just 0.2-0.4 calories per gram, it consists of only 1/10th of the calories of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Vital for organs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: It is safe for vital organs such as the liver, kidneys and fat tissues and also reduces inflammation and oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthy for blood-sugar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: With its low glycemic index, allulose improves insulin sensitivity and reduces post-meal glucose spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increases energy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Allulose not only boosts mitochondrial function but also improves endurance and protects the body against diabetic nephropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Improves metabolism and reduces fat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: Allulose also helps in fat burning, reduces body fat and enhances feelings of satiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27679102" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="natural-sources-of-allulose" source="keywords"&gt;natural sources of Allulose&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

He added how stevia and truvia are often mixed with artificial sweeteners and their long-term use can increase craving and weight. Other sugars such as coconut and date are natural but have varying glycemic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10079081/#sec017" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine, a 5g-10g intake of allulose per meal is effective enough to lower postprandial blood glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: This article is for information purposes only.

Confirmed cases appear to be the “tip of a much bigger iceberg”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000. However, as the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/29/childhood-immunisation-plummeted-pandemic" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;disrupted routine childhood visits&lt;/a&gt; to the doctors and anti-vaccine organizations saw their &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-vaccine-group-ican-del-bigtree-rfk-jr-nearly-doubled-revenue-rcna185214" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;coffers swell&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, measles vaccination rates have fallen below a critical threshold to prevent outbreaks in some communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of 4 July, &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Johns Hopkins University’s&lt;/a&gt; Center for Outbreak Response Innovation counted 1,277 measles cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; 1,267 cases, but has not updated its data since 2 July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The number of new cases has slowed down, but I don’t think there’s any reason to suggest this will be our last,” said Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean for the national school of tropical medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He later added: “It’s a very dark epidemic that never had to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest national tally will eclipse 2019, when unvaccinated members of New York City’s isolated orthodox Jewish community drove a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;large outbreak&lt;/a&gt;, and the nation ended the year with 1,274 confirmed measles cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Americans will need to look back to 1992 to find a higher annual measles tally. In 1992, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00020688.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; confirmed 2,126 cases, with the largest outbreaks in Kentucky and Texas. Texas has confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;753 cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, according to the state health department, opening up the possibility that Texas could exceed the 1992 annual total as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The enormous outbreak comes as Donald Trump’s health secretary, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, who once ran an influential anti-vaccine group, has injected upheaval into US vaccine policy and spread misinformation about treatments for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is a viral disease characterized by a top-down rash, high fever, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The virus is one of the most infectious diseases known to medicine. There is no cure for measles. The best way to prevent measles is by getting vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR), which is 97% effective with two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although most people recover, as many as one in five infected children require hospitalization; one in 20 get pneumonia and one in 1,000 can develop encephalitis, which can lead to lifelong disability, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. The disease can also &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20found%20that%2C%20after,personal%20replies%20cannot%20be%20provided.)" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;weaken the host’s immune system&lt;/a&gt; and lead to more future infections. In rare cases, measles can cause an incurable &lt;a href="https://www.encephalitis.info/types-of-encephalitis/infectious-encephalitis/measles-infection-and-encephalitis/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;degenerative brain disorder&lt;/a&gt;. The US has already seen three deaths from measles this year, both in otherwise healthy children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Before a measles vaccine was licensed in 1963, an estimated 3-4 million Americans were sickened each year, 48,000 were hospitalized and an estimated 400-500 died, according to the CDC. From 1994 to 2023 in the US alone, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm#T2_down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; the measles vaccine saved 85,000 lives and prevented 104m illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Although the vaccine has been wildly successful, it has also been the target of sustained misinformation by people who have a financial stake in reduced vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 1998, a British doctor hypothesized a link between the MMR and increasing autism rates. The doctor, Andrew Wakefield, was later found to have committed &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fraud&lt;/a&gt;, failed to report conflicts of interest and lost his license. The article was retracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://asatonline.org/research-treatment/resources/topical-articles/autism-and-vaccines-the-evidence-to-date/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Reams of science&lt;/a&gt; has since examined and re-examined the evidence, and found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Still, the debunked connection has found an afterlife as a talking point for anti-vaccine groups who have attracted a vocal minority of parents. The overwhelming majority of Americans still vaccinate children against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now, alongside longtime anti-vaccine talking points about autism and “medical freedom”, Hotez said a new threat was the, “very pernicious health and wellness and influencer movement that’s got a big profit motive”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Outbreaks appear to be “occurring in the same [parts] of the US that had some of the lowest Covid vaccination rates”, said Hotez, introducing the possibility that anti-vaccine sentiment is “spilling over to childhood immunizations”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In June, Kennedy unilaterally &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; all 17 expert members of a CDC advisory panel on vaccines and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/eight-new-cdc-vaccine-advisers-robert-f-kennedy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stacked&lt;/a&gt; the committee with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/rfk-vaccine-advisory-panel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;seven&lt;/a&gt; ideological allies.

In June, the group met for the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-acip" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;first time&lt;/a&gt;, and said it would form a new committee to re-evaluate the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We’ve not only eliminated measles, we’ve eliminated the memory of measles,” said Offit. “People don’t remember how sick this virus can make you – or how dead it can make you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOYlFkamExbGhfbjdNbEFsMnpWT2lQR2xfZUViN0NJN2RwRWxCUTFyQi01VkE1V3Jfd2NNV19STHMzS3RpQlVyb0F5MTBsUHg3T2EzQW1Ma3RNUm1yMEp3aE44a1dDU0lqX2dSdndrSWhHanBPeWJqMmFCRFc2MVRFRA</guid></item><item><title>在原发性干燥综合征中发现某些免疫细胞类型失调-干燥综合征新闻 | Certain immune cell types found dysregulated in primary Sjögren’s - Sjogren's Syndrome News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPYk9WRDZlWElXTEhzM0tQLWVGc3ozNjFtQ0pwZkliRkpzaUlINFpOX1NZZkZNemQySXg3aG5JRFZOU0o2TkdFUUJXS2t6d1dPMW5FNm9ZNXlnenJBdEZUVDVTanZqTnJhTXVsTGFLY2hScXdXcnQ1VUZwMWphRW5fTFFqUkFzUVR1SU5UZGFWVVpOVWgwSDFZNlVJUVFDUjFqWnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain immune cell types are dysregulated in people with primary &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/what-is-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study from researchers in China that points to the resulting alterations as possible drivers of the condition and factors influencing its severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our study demonstrates significant alterations in circulating immune cell populations in patients with [primary Sjögren’s], linking these changes to clinical disease activity,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team further highlighted three specific immune cell types with potential as biomarkers of the disease, and possibly as targets for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings may provide mechanistic insights into … pathogenesis [disease development] and establish a foundation for developing … targeted therapeutic strategies,” the scientists wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their study, “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1756-185X.70276"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Immunophenotypic Profiling Reveals Circulating Lymphocyte Dysregulation in Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An autoimmune condition, &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/causes-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;Sjögren’s is caused&lt;/a&gt; by the immune system mistakenly targeting the body’s own cells, causing an inflammatory response. This typically occurs in tear and salivary glands, leading to dry eyes and dry mouth — the most common &lt;a href="https://sjogrenssyndromenews.com/symptoms-of-sjogrens-syndrome/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the condition occurs without another underlying autoimmune disease, it is classified as primary Sjögren’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several types of immune cells may contribute to Sjögren’s. Broadly, these include B cells, which produce antibodies, and T cells, which help coordinate the immune response and can kill infected or abnormal cells. Both are types of lymphocytes, a subset of white blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scientists looked for changes, patterns in immune cell types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some immune changes occur in specific tissues, dysregulation also affects lymphocytes circulating throughout the body. However, “the relationship between peripheral immune cell alterations and clinical outcomes is not fully understood,” the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify this relationship, the scientists assessed levels of several of T- and B-cell subtypes in blood samples from 43 people with primary Sjögren’s. Participants in this group had an average age of 43.5 and about 95% were female. A group of 46 participants without chronic inflammatory disorders, but with similar age and sex characteristics, served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, B-cell levels were significantly higher in the Sjögren’s patients than in controls, with elevated levels of one particular subtype, CD21-/low B-cells. This subtype is also present at high levels in &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.535784/full"&gt;other chronic immune conditions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that higher levels of CD21-/low B-cells correlated with greater disease severity in this Sjögren’s population. Other subtypes of B-cells, on the other hand, were lower in the Sjögren’s patients than in the controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate profound alterations in peripheral lymphocyte subsets in patients with [primary Sjögren’s], revealing distinct immune dysregulation patterns within T and B cell populations,” the researchers wrote. Alterations included significantly higher levels of certain immune cell subtypes and significantly lower levels of others. For some subtypes, levels correlated with disease severity as measured using the EULAR Sjögren’s Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSAI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Altered levels of T-cell subtypes seen in Sjögren’s patients&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although overall levels of certain T cells, like T-helper (Th) and T-follicular helper (Tfh) cells, were similar between groups, patients with Sjögren’s showed altered levels of several T-cell subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, according to the researchers, Th2 and Th17 cells — types of helper T cells that coordinate immune responses — were significantly increased. These elevated Th2 and Th17 levels are consistent with their known roles in driving B cell hyperactivity and glandular inflammation, highlighting their contribution to early disease development, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, total cytotoxic T (Tc) cells, which target and kill damaged or infected cells, were significantly higher in the Sjögren’s group, and also correlated with more severe disease as measured by ESSAI scores, the data showed. The team also reported that the Tc1 and Tc17 subtypes were significantly decreased in patients compared with controls, and noted that higher Tc1 levels were associated with milder disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;The identification of [these cell types] as potential mediators of disease activity, … highlights actionable pathways for further exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These findings may provide insight into the processes that cause primary Sjögren’s, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The identification of CD21−/low B cells as potential mediators of disease activity, alongside Th17 or Tc cell imbalances, highlights actionable pathways for further exploration,” the team wrote. These three cell types may provide biological markers of disease state and potential therapeutic targets, they noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while the scientists say their findings “provide a foundation for understanding T and B cell dysfunction” in primary Sjögren’s, they add that “future multicenter studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these observations and explore their therapeutic implications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team noted several limitations to the study, specifically that this disease population tended to have milder forms of Sjögren’s. People with more severe versions of the disease may show different patterns in immune dysregulation, the team cautioned. This could indicate different immune processes at play depending on disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Sjogren's Syndrome News</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 18:36:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPYk9WRDZlWElXTEhzM0tQLWVGc3ozNjFtQ0pwZkliRkpzaUlINFpOX1NZZkZNemQySXg3aG5JRFZOU0o2TkdFUUJXS2t6d1dPMW5FNm9ZNXlnenJBdEZUVDVTanZqTnJhTXVsTGFLY2hScXdXcnQ1VUZwMWphRW5fTFFqUkFzUVR1SU5UZGFWVVpOVWgwSDFZNlVJUVFDUjFqWnc</guid></item><item><title>逆转胰岛素抵抗和肥胖的3种令人惊讶的方法—第3种是最疯狂的！ - KSL新闻 | 3 surprising ways to reverse insulin resistance and obesity — No. 3 is the craziest! - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOMVdHLXJ6MnkycHdFTkI2UVJ0TjktVjlZdkxldXBLVE9uWC02LUczZlRUSlZsaGtuLUVZbWVoM20yY2VFNDF2bS1qVTFxNkdVc3k0dWZ6a2F3T05MZVRCQjA0X1RTSTZXYi1mbWtkbGxzV3pRNzRBWTRDc1hTVVBSS3ZNQWV6dlk5SzdTTjhtWmFaTklKRXJlaFVPRW1hdllBRTBycmM1QmRuUldGcmgxSWJ1Q0Z5R1lGdlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not insulin's fault. Insulin is just the messenger. When sugar levels are high in the bloodstream, insulin instructs body cells to open their doors and allow sugar in. But under certain circumstances cells ignore insulin's message and the doors remain shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the doors stay shut, you've got two problems. One, you don't get enough fuel (sugar) into the cells, so you're tired. Two, sugar stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the sugar is removed and stored as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you're fat and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How likely is it that you have insulin resistance? "Pretty likely ,and getting more likely all the time," says Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of adults with insulin resistance has doubled in the last 20 years, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507839/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;according to research&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22206-insulin-resistance" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Cleveland Clinic reports&lt;/a&gt; this is due to many factors including worsening diets, the exposure to more drugs and toxins, more stress and more fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Insulin resistance is perhaps the most serious epidemic in the world today, Roberts says. "It can lead to all the major killers including heart disease, obesity, strokes, diabetes and &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/sugar--insulin-resistance-and-cancer--what-is-the-link.h00-159461634.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The good news is that we are learning all the time better ways to reverse it. Some are surprising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Pixel-Shot - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One: Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9036496/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the National Library of Medicine showed that people who get less than seven hours of sleep have higher levels of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a problem since well over half my patients have some form of insomnia. They struggle falling asleep, staying asleep, or just getting sound sleep," Roberts says. "That's why at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, improving our patients' quality and quantity of sleep is one of our highest priorities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep, however, is easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fortunately, we have found that lowering total body inflammation through a proprietary combination of herbs, foods and therapies leads to improved sleep in almost all of our patients," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Nasnunt - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Two: Antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second surprising way to reverse insulin resistance is to increase your consumption of antioxidants. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1865087/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;One study showed&lt;/a&gt; that taking 2 grams of vitamin C for two weeks resulted in a significant change in insulin resistance. Roberts explains this is why Health Utah's health and weight loss program relies heavily on eating foods rich in antioxidants. Additionally certain foods with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7602234/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;high polyphenol and phytonutrient content&lt;/a&gt; are recommended as they have also been found to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is the hard part. Everyone knows they should be eating better. It's just hard when low-quality foods are flavor-enhanced, sugar-laced, caffeine boosted and so convenient. That's why the health and weight loss program at Health Utah focuses heavily on making the transition to healing foods easier. They use a process called framework that engages the subconscious mind to reframe your relationship with food. Weekly classes and educational materials also provide skills, tools, and strategies necessary to achieve sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: hocine - stock.adobe.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Three: Lemon juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest way science has found to help reverse insulin resistance is drinking lemon juice. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7468735/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Scientific research&lt;/a&gt; is now reflecting what holistic healers have suggested for years, that lemon juice has a powerful effect for good in the body, even improving sensitivity to insulin and lowering blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IRJuly25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; utilize this kind of knowledge in working with their patients. Lemon juice has been a consistent part of their health and weight loss program for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our patients start their health and weight loss program, they begin by cleaning out the body. This requires improving liver function," Roberts says. "Lemons, herbs and in-office therapies facilitate this detoxification as well as the reversal of insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health Utah specializes in sustainable weight loss. Everything they do is geared toward this goal. Their coaching, their classes, their work with the subconscious mind, the fact that they don't count calories or cut out carbs and their focus on reversing insulin resistance create a lasting solution to the health and weight issues of their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=IR2" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; invites KSL readers to take advantage of a $59 weight loss package. The package allows two people to get body scans. These scans identify potential underlying conditions that cause insulin resistance and stubborn weight.

&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet combines the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes those foods, with the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is designed to lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks on the diet, men increased their protein and fiber intake, which may support muscle and digestive health. Women saw significant decreases in weight, waist circumference, and lean body mass. Those results indicate the diet may have influenced nutrition habits and body composition in different ways for men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the percentage of dietary fat and saturated fat decreased in both men and women, patients still ate more fats than recommended, indicating that “ensuring the recommended level of intake is important,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211034825003402"&gt;Effect of MIND diet on oxidative stress markers in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Healthy diet linked to slower disease progression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence highlights the benefits of a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; in slowing MS disease progression. For example, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/10/17/mediterranean-diet-associated-lower-disability-risk-study/"&gt;following a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; is linked to a lower risk of disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of researchers in Turkey wanted to see if the MIND diet could strengthen antioxidant defenses in MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antioxidants help protect the body from oxidative stress, an imbalance between harmful molecules called free radicals and the body’s ability to neutralize them. By counteracting these molecules, which can trigger and sustain inflammation, antioxidants may help reduce inflammation and potentially slow the progression of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;MS symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 30 patients with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt;. Most were not smokers (60%) and did not drink alcohol (83.3%), but the vast majority (93.3%) led a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They followed the MIND diet for eight weeks. They were also advised to limit red meat and processed meat products, as well as sugary, fried, and high-fat foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After eight weeks, total antioxidant status — a measure of the body’s total ability to neutralize harmful free radicals — increased significantly. Although the levels of specific antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) didn’t increase significantly, they showed an upward trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In men, body measurements didn’t change significantly. But women experienced a significant reduction in body weight, body mass index (a measure that uses height and weight to estimate body fat), and waist circumference by the end of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women also had a significant reduction in total body bone-free lean mass, which refers to the body’s muscle mass without bones. This reduction could be a concern for muscle health, especially for patients who already face a higher risk of losing muscle mass, a condition known as sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted the importance of getting enough dietary protein — at least one gram of protein per kilogram of body weight (g/kg) — to help prevent muscle loss. Protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In men, daily protein intake increased from an average of 0.8 g/kg to 1 g/kg. In women, however, there were no significant changes. Overall, average dietary fiber intake increased significantly, which can improve the intestinal microbial composition and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total fat intake and saturated fat intake remained higher than recommended levels. Saturated fats, commonly found in fried and processed foods, are known to increase inflammation and oxidative stress, so reducing these is important for people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Findings of the study showed that the MIND diet may has positive effects on increasing the defense system against disease-related inflammation and oxidative stress,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:49:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVzZ5WTgtMzlTdXZ1bF9YWjhCN1c1SVV4aDJyaWF4eVlGOV9aZHpFQTRseWV0SHo5Z0dpWmVhR3cxbWFaay1ORUJxUHpBTXE3eXZGaEVBTGV1Z0I1amd1dGlGdk81YWdLaXhFRkdQbkNrSkNYS2VCeVF5U293aExFLWVRbzA3dzFUeEFYajVGeE5JNDFZSFY1RjZ5STduQXR6amktZ2ZfRmtIZjNYZHVlX2JhMk9tMWpyekE</guid></item><item><title>这种咳嗽糖浆成分实际上可能减缓痴呆症- Gizmodo | This Cough Syrup Ingredient Might Actually Slow Dementia - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPeGtTa0Q0ZC1wVlk5amFuaGJGTF9CRGJkVFlOd09WQmpGV0tUMktHMXpmS1Z3X2d6ZFhkRDhhMkI4T2lsMV9oZU1yc01KV3JEQzJUckR2S0RfeC1ZTm8wakFKc0Ztd0hmZGNpMzE5UGM1TnRGNkVtYmQ5Z0lzcnJKTVpyTFozX3UwU3h0S1JPTG0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Today’s cough syrup could turn into tomorrow’s treatment for Parkinson’s disease. Recent research in the U.K. is the latest to suggest that a common ingredient in cough syrup, ambroxol, might be able to slow down the progression of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at St. Joseph’s Health Care London conducted the year-long small study, which involved 55 patients with Parkinson’s-related dementia. The drug was safely tolerated and may have stabilized people’s symptoms, particularly people more genetically vulnerable to the neurodegenerative disease. Researchers elsewhere have already begun to test ambroxol for Parkinson’s and related dementias in larger trials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;“These findings suggest &lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;Ambroxol&lt;/span&gt; may protect brain function, especially in those genetically at risk. It offers a promising new treatment avenue where few currently exist,” said study author Stephen Pasternak, a cognitive neuroscientist at Lawson Research Institute, the research arm of St. Joseph’s Health Care London, in a &lt;a href="https://www.sjhc.london.on.ca/research/stories/landmark-study-investigates-potential-of-ambroxol-cough-medicine-to-slow"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/ambroxol.html"&gt;Ambroxol&lt;/a&gt; is commonly used as an expectorant in cough syrup, helping thin out mucus so people with respiratory illnesses can clear phlegm from their airways and breathe easier. But recently, scientists have speculated that it can also target a key driver of Parkinson’s, the accumulation of abnormal alpha-synuclein in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have found that ambroxol can raise people’s levels of glucocerebrosidase (GCase), another protein that helps regulate the brain’s waste clearance system. In people with Parkinson’s, levels of GCase tend to decline as levels of abnormal alpha-synuclein rise. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.gaucherdisease.org/blog/gaucher-disease-and-parkinsons-what-to-know-now/"&gt;known&lt;/a&gt; that people with certain genetic mutations affecting GCase function are at higher risk for Parkinson’s. Scientists have hoped that ambroxol can indirectly lower people’s alpha-synuclein by increasing GCase, reversing or at least slowing down the progression of Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers randomized people with Parkinson’s-related dementia to either receive a placebo or a high dose of ambroxol (taken via pills daily) over a 12-month span. There were no severe symptoms linked to the drug’s use, the researchers found, and common adverse effects were typically gastrointestinal. People on placebo also experienced worsening psychiatric symptoms of their Parkinson’s and an increase in levels of GFAP (a blood marker of brain damage), whereas those on ambroxol appeared to stay about the same.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW34920009 BCX0 NormalTextRun" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;“This early trial offers hope and provides a strong foundation for larger studies,” Pasternak said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s results, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2835760"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; late last month in JAMA Neurology, were not a clear home run, however. There was overall no difference in cognition between the placebo and treatment groups, for instance. People with GCase-related genetic mutations taking the drug may have experienced improved cognition, though the sample sizes were too small to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, enough evidence has built up that other scientists are taking a chance on ambroxol. There are at least &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05778617"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04588285"&gt;clinical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://neurologyopen.bmj.com/content/5/2/e000535"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; of the drug for Parkinson’s and similar conditions linked to GCase underway right now. The largest of these trials is testing ambroxol in over 300 people with Parkinson’s over a two-year span. It will take years for these studies to wrap up, but if successful, ambroxol could very well become the first treatment able to slow down the destruction caused by Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;Plain and simple, building muscle can be challenging &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/muscle-strength-exercises-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;after 40&lt;/a&gt;. The great news is, it’s totally possible to achieve with just the right workout plan in place. In fact, developing stronger arms can be much easier than you may think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s first address the reasons why &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/over-40-best-exercises-for-muscle-maintenance/" target="_blank"&gt;building muscle&lt;/a&gt; is more difficult to accomplish at this age. First off, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2804956/" target="_blank"&gt;muscle mass decreases after your 30s&lt;/a&gt; and your body takes longer to rebuild and repair muscle tissue. In addition, your joints lose strength and lower testosterone levels negatively impact muscle protein growth.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.instagram.com/eddieup/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eddie Baruta&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, celebrity PT and global head of gym floor personal training at Ultimate Performance, who explains common myths and helpful tips to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/5-doorway-moves-strong-arms-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;build strong arms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Myths About Building Strong Arms After 40&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing a ton of bicep curls is not the way to build big, strong arms after 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is not only ineffective but also short-sighted,” Eddie explains. “Many people mistakenly isolate their biceps with ego-lifting—choosing weights that are far too heavy and using momentum rather than proper form. What they often fail to realize is that arm size and strength are significantly influenced by total lean body mass and full-body training. It takes an additional 10 to 15 pounds of lean body weight to add just an inch to your arm’s circumference, which highlights how crucial whole-body development is for arm gains.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another misconception is that your biceps are the most essential muscle group to achieve bigger arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In reality, the triceps make up more than two-thirds of the upper arm’s mass,” Eddie tells us. “Neglecting triceps work in favor of biceps curls is a common mistake. Comprehensive arm development—especially for individuals over 40—demands thoughtful, balanced programming, including both compound lifts and specific isolation exercises.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 Tips To Boost Arm Strength&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 40, building arm strength consists of consistency, recovery, and savvy training principles. Here are a few pointers to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a four-day training split, Eddie recommends dedicating one to two weekly workouts specifically to arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This ensures direct stimulation of both biceps and triceps for hypertrophy,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Since triceps account for the majority of arm mass, incorporating exercises like close-grip bench presses, dips, and skull crushers is critical,” Eddie points out. “Don’t fall into the trap of training only what you see in the mirror.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For clients over 40, Eddie recommends a variety of carefully curated movements that prioritize both safety and hypertrophy. Some examples?&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Key go-to moves include the EZ-bar preacher curl for biceps and the close-grip bench press for triceps. These are paired together in an antagonistic superset (a training technique where you pair two exercises that work opposing muscle groups and perform them back-to-back with little to no rest in between), which not only saves time but also enhances neuromuscular efficiency,” he says. “I would also strongly recommend the 45-degree dumbbell curl and incline dumbbell triceps extension, as both offer effective ways to hit both muscle groups from different angles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you enter your 40s, movement quality becomes more important than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Slower, more controlled reps with full range of motion create greater muscle stress and are much safer for joints and tendons that might be more vulnerable with age,” Eddie explains. “I would emphasize training with a controlled tempo (take three seconds to lower the weight, pause for a second, then lift explosively back up) and a full range of motion, which often necessitates reducing the weight used. Increasing the time under tension, even with moderate loads, can be more productive for muscle growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s common to have smaller arms if you’re underweight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By increasing lean muscle mass across the body, you’ll naturally support bigger and stronger arms,” says Eddie.&lt;/p&gt;
