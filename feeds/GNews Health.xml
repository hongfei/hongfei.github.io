About 73% of Americans drink it every day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/coffee-survey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Drive Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Drive Research&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you prefer a hot cup of drip, an icy cold brew, or something a bit creamier, perhaps you've wondered just &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/a63325264/is-coffee-healthy-to-drink-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:how healthy is it to drink coffee every day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;how healthy is it to drink coffee every day&lt;/a&gt;? Well, a new study might make you feel good about your daily cup of joe–that is, depending on how you take your coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observational &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002231662500286X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal Of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; found that low to moderate coffee consumption (1 to 3 cups per day) was linked to a lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality. But there's a caveat–these results are only associated with black coffee or coffee with small amounts of added saturated fat and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The health benefits of coffee consumption may be diminished when sugar and saturated fat are added," the study concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality for those that consumed black coffee or coffee with low levels of sugar and saturated fat, compared to those that drank no coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2018, linked to National Death Index Mortality Data. The data showed that over 53% of adults over 20 years old drink coffee daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it’s important for us to know what it might mean for health,” &lt;a href="https://nutrition.tufts.edu/academics/faculty/fang-fang-zhang" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fang Fang Zhang;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Fang Fang Zhang&lt;/a&gt;, senior author of the study and professor at Tufts University's Friedman School, told &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/06/16/hold-cream-and-sugar-black-coffee-linked-lower-risk-death" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tufts Now;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tufts Now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds, but our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 18:15:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBJeDJFLUFOakZ3OFNrY1lPTktWd2pvbXZESm1WNTk5Q0xpNjVXblFWenN6bjE0b0h2NDhqOTRpazZMUmlhS2l0TVlSQzZveWNKRmNPb0xxMi1iRG94cTJwbXgyYXB0ZEdBM2NZSHJrTVpnTFU1a2c</guid></item><item><title>水果比运动对减肥更有效？科学揭示如何针对腹部脂肪-玻璃年鉴 | Fruit more effective than exercise for weight loss?

			&lt;p data-start="95" data-end="553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to losing weight, many of us rush to try the latest trendy diet or complex exercise routines, often overlooking something much simpler and more accessible: fruit. In fact, some fruits may hold the secret to a flatter stomach and a healthier metabolism, without needing to hit the gym. One such fruit, often underestimated, has caught the attention of nutrition experts for its surprising effectiveness in targeting belly fat—the banana.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="95" data-end="553"&gt;&lt;span id="more-8490"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="555" data-end="616"&gt;The Power of the Banana: A Surprising Ally for Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="618" data-end="897"&gt;Bananas might not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think about weight loss, but they have more to offer than meets the eye. This everyday fruit is packed with nutrients that make it a potent tool for shedding those stubborn pounds, especially in the abdominal area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="899" data-end="1374"&gt;Nutrition experts have long praised the banana for its high &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/quantum-teleportation-via-fiber-optic-are-unhackable-communications-near/"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="959" data-end="976"&gt;fiber content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which helps keep you feeling full longer. But there’s much more to it. Bananas—whether ripe or slightly under-ripe—are rich in &lt;strong data-start="1105" data-end="1125"&gt;resistant starch&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong data-start="1130" data-end="1150"&gt;prebiotic fibers&lt;/strong&gt;, which help regulate digestion and accelerate metabolism. These elements work together to combat &lt;strong data-start="1248" data-end="1264"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/strong&gt;, the dangerous fat that accumulates around the organs and is often responsible for a bloated belly【¹】.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1376" data-end="1438"&gt;Bananas and Gut Health: The Hidden Benefits for Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1440" data-end="1864"&gt;One of the key reasons bananas are so effective in promoting a flat stomach is their ability to improve &lt;strong data-start="1544" data-end="1558"&gt;gut health&lt;/strong&gt;. Bananas are rich in &lt;strong data-start="1580" data-end="1594"&gt;prebiotics&lt;/strong&gt;, which nourish beneficial gut bacteria, particularly &lt;strong data-start="1648" data-end="1666"&gt;bifidobacteria&lt;/strong&gt;. According to Kate Netz, a registered dietitian interviewed by &lt;em data-start="1730" data-end="1740"&gt;Eat This&lt;/em&gt;, research has shown that a healthy balance of these bacteria can help improve metabolism and promote weight loss【²】.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1866" data-end="2190"&gt;Additionally, the fiber in bananas helps regulate bowel movements, preventing &lt;strong data-start="1944" data-end="1960"&gt;constipation&lt;/strong&gt; and bloating—two major culprits when it comes to feeling uncomfortable in your own skin. This combination of improved digestion and reduced bloating is why bananas are often recommended for anyone looking to trim their waistline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="2192" data-end="2240"&gt;How Bananas Keep You Full and Reduce Cravings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2242" data-end="2532"&gt;Bananas are packed with &lt;strong data-start="2266" data-end="2275"&gt;fiber&lt;/strong&gt;, which has a few key benefits when it comes to weight loss. Fiber takes longer to digest, allowing your body to feel full for a longer period of time. This natural appetite control reduces the likelihood of reaching for unhealthy snacks throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2534" data-end="2907"&gt;For those struggling with emotional eating, bananas also offer a solution. They are rich in &lt;strong data-start="2626" data-end="2639"&gt;magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;, which can help lower &lt;strong data-start="2662" data-end="2681"&gt;cortisol levels&lt;/strong&gt;, the hormone responsible for stress-induced cravings. When eaten before a meal or as a snack, bananas can curb hunger, making it easier to stick to a healthy eating plan without the urge to indulge in sugary treats【³】.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="2909" data-end="2958"&gt;Resistant Starch: A Key Ingredient for Satiety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2960" data-end="3393"&gt;A particularly impressive feature of bananas, especially when they’re slightly under-ripe, is their &lt;strong data-start="3060" data-end="3080"&gt;resistant starch&lt;/strong&gt; content. This type of starch acts like fiber and doesn’t immediately turn into sugar after it’s consumed, keeping you feeling fuller for longer. According to experts, when &lt;strong data-start="3253" data-end="3273"&gt;resistant starch&lt;/strong&gt; is broken down in the digestive system, it also releases hormones that signal to your brain that you’re full【⁴】.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3395" data-end="3684"&gt;These hormones help to suppress hunger and prevent the constant snacking that often leads to weight gain. The longer feeling of fullness that comes from eating a banana also helps to avoid the usual digestive discomforts like bloating, which often result from overconsumption of junk food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="3686" data-end="3733"&gt;Bananas and Metabolism: Boosting Fat Burning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3735" data-end="4111"&gt;Another reason bananas are so effective for weight loss is their ability to boost &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/the-simple-japanese-technique-for-faster-metabolism-and-weight-loss/"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3817" data-end="3831"&gt;metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A study published in &lt;em data-start="3854" data-end="3878"&gt;Nutrition &amp;amp; Metabolism&lt;/em&gt; found that replacing regular carbohydrates with resistant starch increased fat burning by 23% after a meal. This means that by including bananas in your diet, you could be accelerating fat burning without doing extra work【⁵】.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4113" data-end="4342"&gt;Bananas contribute to a more efficient metabolism, helping your body burn calories faster, even when you’re not working out. This makes them an excellent addition to your diet if you’re aiming for sustained weight loss over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4344" data-end="4399"&gt;Bananas and Insulin Regulation: Reducing Fat Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4401" data-end="4724"&gt;Bananas also play a role in regulating &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/how-walking-after-meals-can-help-you-lose-weight-but-only-if-you-time-it-right/"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4440" data-end="4451"&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; levels, which is crucial for weight management. &lt;strong data-start="4500" data-end="4518"&gt;Insulin spikes&lt;/strong&gt;, often caused by high-sugar meals, promote fat storage, especially in the abdominal area. By eating bananas, which help stabilize blood sugar levels, you can reduce the body’s tendency to store excess fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4726" data-end="5002"&gt;Dr. Jean-Michel Cohen, a French nutrition expert, explains that consistent insulin spikes lead to both fat storage and increased cravings for more sugary foods. Bananas, with their balanced sugar content, help avoid these spikes and encourage a healthier metabolism【⁶】.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="5004" data-end="5071"&gt;Potassium-Packed Bananas: A Natural Solution for Water Retention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5073" data-end="5407"&gt;Another benefit of bananas for weight loss is their high &lt;strong data-start="5130" data-end="5143"&gt;potassium&lt;/strong&gt; content. &lt;strong data-start="5153" data-end="5166"&gt;Potassium&lt;/strong&gt; helps fight &lt;strong data-start="5179" data-end="5198"&gt;water retention&lt;/strong&gt;, which often causes bloating and puffiness, especially around the belly. A study from 2011 found that women who ate a small banana before meals, twice a day, experienced a 50% reduction in bloating【⁷】.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5409" data-end="5610"&gt;This natural diuretic effect of bananas is particularly beneficial for those struggling with the discomfort of water retention, helping to reduce puffiness and give the appearance of a flatter stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="5612" data-end="5662"&gt;Bananas for Energy: The Ideal Pre-Workout Snack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5664" data-end="5974"&gt;If you’re looking to maximize your workouts, bananas make the perfect pre-exercise snack. Their natural sugars provide a quick energy boost, allowing you to perform better during physical activity. Plus, they help sustain energy levels throughout your workout, optimizing the results you get from your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5976" data-end="6046"&gt;Conclusion: The Humble Banana as Your Secret Weapon for Weight Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6048" data-end="6397"&gt;While many people are looking for quick-fix solutions like expensive supplements or trendy diets, the humble &lt;strong data-start="6157" data-end="6167"&gt;banana&lt;/strong&gt; offers a natural and effective way to target &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/expert-shares-8-realistic-ways-to-lose-belly-fat-no-crash-diets-required/"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6213" data-end="6226"&gt;belly fat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Packed with &lt;strong data-start="6240" data-end="6249"&gt;fiber&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="6251" data-end="6271"&gt;resistant starch&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong data-start="6277" data-end="6290"&gt;potassium&lt;/strong&gt;, this fruit not only helps keep you full and satisfied but also supports healthy digestion and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6399" data-end="6632"&gt;So, the next time you reach for a snack, consider grabbing a banana. It might just be the key to achieving a flatter stomach, improved metabolism, and more sustainable weight loss—without the need for extreme exercise or fancy diets.&lt;/p&gt;

Sedentary behaviour from a young age can lead to a two-thirds increase in cholesterol levels in adulthood, heightening the risk of cardiac issues and premature death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, new research suggests that light exercise could completely counteract these dangers. The study highlights that activities such as walking and doing household chores might eliminate the need for cholesterol-lowering drugs like statins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Childhood high cholesterol has been linked to early indicators of heart disease in adults and a higher chance of dying from cardiovascular issues prematurely. Interestingly, the study proposes that light physical activity may be more beneficial than more intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team behind the research believes that global guidelines for children's physical activity should incorporate their findings. Dr Andrew Agbaje from the University of Exeter, who spearheaded the study, commented: "These findings emphasise the incredible health importance of light physical activity and shows it could be the key to preventing elevated cholesterol and dyslipidaemia from early life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "We have evidence that light physical activity is considerably more effective than moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in this regard, and therefore it's perhaps time the World Health Organisation (WHO) updated their guidelines on childhood exercise, and public health experts, paediatricians, and health policymakers encouraged more participation in light physical activity from childhood."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added: "Our research suggests light physical activity may be an unsung hero and it is about time the world replaced the mantra of 'an average of 60 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity' with 'at least 3 hours a day of light physical activity'.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Light physical activity appears to be the antidote to the catastrophic effect of sedentary time in the young population."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The WHO currently recommends that children and adolescents should build up an average 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity a day and reduce sedentary time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has limited guidelines for light physical activity. However, the study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, found light physical activity – which also includes slow dancing, swimming, or cycling – is up to five times more effective than moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at promoting healthy hearts and lowering inflammation in the young population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, which analysed 792 children, utilised a device akin to a pedometer to measure sedentary time, light physical activity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at ages 11, 15, and 24 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cholesterol levels were repeatedly assessed at ages 15, 17, and 24 years, and the children also underwent repeated evaluations of total body fat mass and muscle mass, as well as various blood tests, with smoking status, socio-economic status, and family history of cardiovascular disease taken into account. Sedentary time increased from roughly six hours a day to nine hours a day, over the course of the 13-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Light physical activity decreased from six hours a day to three hours a day while moderate-to-vigorous physical activity remained relatively stable at around 50 minutes a day from childhood until young adulthood. The average increase in total cholesterol was 0.69 millimoles per litre (mmol/l).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research found that an average of four-and-a-half hours a day of light physical activity from childhood through young adulthood decreased total cholesterol. Approximately 50 minutes a day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity from childhood was also associated with slightly reduced total cholesterol (-0.05 mmol/L), but total body fat mass decreased the effect of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on total cholesterol by up to 48%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers highlighted that the rise in fat mass counteracted the modest impact of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on total cholesterol levels. Dr Agbaje remarked: "Our study shows increased sedentary time in childhood may contribute to two thirds of the total increase in a person's cholesterol levels before their mid-twenties. This suggests childhood sedentariness may be a major risk factor for elevated cholesterol and subsequent premature heart attack or stroke when individuals reach their mid-forties."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2023 study, a collaborative effort by the University of Exeter, University of Eastern Finland, and University of Bristol, utilised data from the University of Bristol's Children of the 90s study, also known as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;NHS ways to lower your cholesterol&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Eat less fatty food&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reduce your cholesterol, try to cut down on fatty food, especially food that contains a type of fat called saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can still have foods that contain a healthier type of fat called unsaturated fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Check labels on food to see what type of fat it has in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Try to eat more:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;oily fish, like mackerel and salmon&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;olive oil, rapeseed oil and spreads made from these oils&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;brown rice, wholegrain bread and wholewheat pasta&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;nuts and seeds&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fruits and vegetables&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Try to eat less:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;meat pies, sausages and fatty meat&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;butter, lard and ghee&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cream and hard cheese, like cheddar&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cakes and biscuits&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;food that contains coconut oil or palm oil&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Exercise more&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aim to do at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) of exercise a week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some good things to try when starting out include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;walking – try to walk fast enough so your heart starts beating faster&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;swimming&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;cycling&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Try a few different exercises to find something you like doing.

The findings suggest that age-related impairments in tactile perception — including sensitivity to pressure, vibration, and object recognition — may predict cognitive challenges and even the progression toward dementia. The review outlines how changes in the brain’s sensory processing areas, especially the hippocampus, are tightly linked to both declining touch perception and memory, attention, and executive functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted this review to better understand how age-related sensory decline, particularly in the tactile system, could be a harbinger of cognitive impairment. As global populations continue to live longer, mild cognitive impairment is becoming more common, affecting roughly one in six older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, this condition progresses to dementia. Identifying early markers of decline can help delay or prevent more serious outcomes. Since most people experience some level of tactile deterioration as they age, the authors wanted to explore whether this decline could provide an early and accessible signal of future cognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this question, the research team examined previous studies that analyzed tactile deterioration across the aging brain. They reviewed evidence from human studies as well as animal models, especially in rodents, which allowed researchers to isolate and manipulate tactile input through experimental methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across this body of literature, the authors looked for connections between loss of tactile function, brain changes, and cognitive outcomes. They paid special attention to the hippocampus and its links to tactile input, spatial memory, and executive function. The review also included structural imaging studies and behavioral assessments, giving a comprehensive overview of how sensory decline and cognitive decline might unfold together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review begins by outlining the gradual decline of the tactile system with age. As early as age 20, touch sensitivity begins to decrease, and by age 60, these changes can be clinically detected. Mechanoreceptors in the skin, particularly Meissner’s and Pacinian corpuscles that detect fine touch and vibration, begin to disappear. The nerves that transmit tactile information lose some of their insulating material, which slows signal transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes affect not just the skin but also the spinal cord and brain, particularly the primary somatosensory cortex, which becomes thinner with age and shows reduced inhibition. This results in poorer touch discrimination, difficulty in manipulating objects, reduced fine motor control, and problems with balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then connected these sensory changes to cognitive decline, particularly in the context of mild cognitive impairment. This condition is defined as a decline in mental functioning that goes beyond normal aging but does not yet interfere significantly with daily activities. It is often a precursor to dementia. Studies show that mild cognitive impairment is more common with increasing age, affecting over one-quarter of people aged 80 or older. Importantly, over a third of these individuals eventually develop dementia. Understanding what triggers this progression is key to prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the review, one of the earliest areas of the brain to show changes in mild cognitive impairment is the hippocampus, a region essential for memory, learning, and executive functioning. The hippocampus receives sensory input from the somatosensory system via the entorhinal cortex. Tactile input helps the hippocampus integrate information and support cognitive flexibility and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When this input is diminished due to aging or sensory deprivation, hippocampal function may suffer. For instance, studies in rodents show that depriving animals of tactile input through whisker removal reduces hippocampal activity, impairs spatial memory, and disrupts synaptic communication in memory-related regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one type of experiment, researchers permanently removed the whiskers of rodents, which serve as their primary tactile system. These animals showed significantly less brain activity in the hippocampus, reduced formation of new neurons, and problems with navigation and object recognition. In contrast, stimulating the whiskers increased dopamine levels in the hippocampus and improved memory performance. These findings mirror what has been observed in human studies, where reduced tactile stimulation can lead to poorer cognitive outcomes, while tactile engagement can improve memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review also highlights proprioception — the sense of body position and movement — and stereognosis — the ability to recognize objects through touch — as key components of the tactile system that are affected by aging. Both are critical for daily functioning and are also linked to cognitive performance. When these abilities decline, individuals may experience increased risk of falls, reduced independence, and fewer opportunities for cognitive engagement. This drop in activity and stimulation can, in turn, accelerate cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more compelling findings discussed in the review is the link between tactile impairments and changes in the neurochemistry of the brain. Sensory stimulation boosts levels of acetylcholine, a chemical that plays a major role in attention and memory. It also promotes the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), both of which help support the growth and survival of neurons. Tactile deprivation, by contrast, lowers these factors, potentially triggering cell death and weakening memory circuits in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors propose that this body of evidence supports the idea that tactile deterioration may be more than just a sign of aging — it could be an early marker of cognitive risk. If so, touch-based assessments could become a valuable tool in detecting people who may benefit from early intervention. This is especially important because many traditional cognitive screening tools may miss early signs, or may not be accessible to all populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review suggests several directions for future research. One recommendation is to develop standardized methods for measuring tactile function, including proprioception and stereognosis, in older adults. These assessments could be added to routine cognitive screenings. Another area for exploration is whether tactile-based interventions — such as textured objects, massage therapy, or sensory-rich environments — can help protect or even restore cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also encourage more research into how different sensory systems interact and contribute to overall cognitive health, including studies that combine touch, sound, and visual stimulation to promote brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2025.109048" target="_blank"&gt;The role of tactile sense as an early indicator of cognitive decline in aging&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Nereida Ibarra-Castaneda, Adriana Gonzalez-De-la-Cerda, and Oscar Gonzalez-Perez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 14:08:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPTzJMUEdMNU1JbXRUYjhJMVU3TG5wWG42U05hMkQyVFpiSTNuQV8xX3NmN3c3WnRyY1VlVkQ3MmF0ZEdob1dqUEFXSGR2QlNjdy1obVc1SEQtZWJkQkR3VE5YWmdsUkh5WW12bjNFOWt6RGRIRklBZUhoRkRQanYzQnN5Y05jS0dGNWNVN1I0UUE</guid></item><item><title>照片：为什么这些女性需要勇气在镜头前摆姿势-美国国家公共广播电台 | Photos: Why it took courage for these women to pose for the camera - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxNOVl6bV9ycklKcTFyMnZKcGQ0R2RrVGYwcHdUUU56dHU3dnVrcW40SjR5eXVBS091S2szWnA3cDN0RC10aDRBZ2xOZVo1MVktZmlMd2xEQUNKRENMNjlUb3EzUFFfb2c0ZmRoWk9tSWFpc2hKOGg5MU5Vc2V1UnFKaUVwbEtBQlNEaldNcDA1S3F0Qmlvd3l1X05tT1dMc0tuS3lpZzY1N0FLMTJtVEtIV3VCeWNhQk1vbTlGNDJ3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                The photo exhibit &lt;em&gt;Sahy Rano&lt;/em&gt;, on display at the Photoville Festival in Brooklyn, New York, through this weekend, draws its title from a Malagasay phrase translated in a wall label as meaning "someone who is not afraid to dive into the water, even if there is a strong current." The photographer wants to bring attention to female genital schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by a waterborne parasitic infection, whose symptoms can be stigmatizing because they resemble symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases.

   &lt;p&gt;A woman named Sylvia Razanaparana, robed in a white dress atop a marine blue shirt, faces the camera with a blue bucket atop her head. The backdrop is sea blue canvas dotted with drops of white. Her hand propped on her hip, she stares at the camera at a three-quarter angle, as if she has something to show, or say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And she does.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She is one of eight women who posed for photographer Miora Rajaonary for a project to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a disease that, according to the World Health Organization, afflicts an estimated 56 million women and girls, mainly in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The waterborne infection is spread by parasitic worms and is found particularly in areas with limited access to clean water and health care.  It is contracted through contact with infected water in which women work (such as rice fields), bathe and do laundry. Considered by the United Nations as one of the most neglected of tropical diseases, it can result in infertility, ectopic pregnancy and genital ulcers. And because its symptoms — including vaginal itchiness and discharge, bloody urine and abdominal and pelvic pain — can resemble those of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), their onset can bring suspicion, shame and dishonor on those who contract them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/media_asset/female_genital_schistosomiasis_and_hiv_en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report by the U.N. agency UNAIDS&lt;/a&gt; characterizes the disease as "underdiagnosed, with grave implications for women's sexual and reproductive health." It is also linked to a higher risk for contracting HIV from an infected partner.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Men can contract the disease as well but a WHO report notes that &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/increasing-awareness-on-genital-manifestations-of-schistosomiasis#:~:text=Genital%20schistosomiasis%20affects%20both%20female%20and%20male%2C,complications%20are%20much%20more%20prevalent%20in%20women.&amp;amp;text=WHO%20in%20collaboration%20with%20UNAIDS%20published%20an,FGS%20and%20sexual%20and%20reproductive%20health%20interventions." target="_blank"&gt;"the clinical signs and complications are much more prevalent in women."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-73497" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://end.org/a-lurking-threat-to-women-and-girls-health-closing-the-information-gap-on-female-genital-schistosomiasis/" target="_blank"&gt;Razanaparana contracted FGS&lt;/a&gt; while working in the rice fields of Ambanja, in northern Madagascar. Her husband accused her of betraying him because of the STD-like symptoms and left her. Only after suffering from the symptoms for four years was she able to be seen by a doctor, visiting her village as part of a medical mission. He quickly diagnosed her, and the deworming medicine praziquantel cured her.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Her story spoke powerfully to Rajaonary, who has included her portrait in her photo exhibit &lt;em&gt;Sahy Rano&lt;/em&gt;, currently on display at the Photoville Festival in Brooklyn, New York. The title is a Malagasay phrase translated in a wall label as meaning "someone who is not afraid to dive into the water, even if there is a strong current." It also also means "someone is really brave," adds Rajaonary, who is herself from Madagascar. Her work was supported by the End Fund, a philanthropy that works to prevent the spread of neglected tropical diseases&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-73498" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The title of the project, says the photographer, is especially apt because some of the women, like Razanaparana, work in the rice fields "so they have to be in the water for their livelihoods. They have no choice but to keep going back" returning to the very waters where they were initially infected.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;To further emphasize their courage in breaking taboos and coming forward to speak about the disease in public, the women portrayed wear traditional Malagasy face masks. Made of cosmetic paste and ground sandalwood, they are both decorative and used to protect the skin. In adorning themselves with beauty masks, they are showing they are like everyone else, with no need to hide. "I sometimes wear a mask when I am on holiday in Madagascar," Rajaonary says. They are very attractive. This is a tradition over centuries."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-73499" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The effect of the painted backdrop, prepared by Rajaonary, is that the women appear to be standing against, or sitting in the water. The white dots, she says, are symbols of the parasites that infest local waters.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She also set up a laundry rope across the canvas backdrop, from which hang the women's shirts, sheets, dresses and clothing — as if the clothing had just been put up to dry after being washed in the contaminated water. "This is their clothing, their laundry, what they wear and how they live," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The colorful pails and buckets visible in each photo also call attention to water's inescapable presence in the women's lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diane Cole writes for many publications, including &lt;/em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;The Washington Post.&lt;em&gt; She is the author of the memoir &lt;/em&gt;After Great Pain: A New Life Emerges. &lt;em&gt;Her website is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dianejoycecole.com/" target="_blank"&gt;DianeJoyceCole.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Kim Beckham, an insurance agent in Victoria, Texas, had seen friends suffer so badly from shingles that she wanted to receive the first approved shingles vaccine as soon as it became available, even if she had to pay for it out of pocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her doctor and several pharmacies turned her down because she was below the recommended age at the time, which was 60. So in 2016, she celebrated her 60th birthday at her local CVS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was there when they opened,” Beckham recalled. After her Zostavax shot, she said, “I felt really relieved.” She has since received the newer, more effective shingles vaccine, as well as the pneumonia shot, the respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, annual flu shots and all recommended COVID vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some older people are really eager to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Wolaner, 71, a retired publisher in Sausalito, Calif., has been known to badger friends who delay getting recommended shots, sending them relevant medical studies. “I’m sort of hectoring,” she acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deana Hendrickson, 66, who provides daily care for three young grandsons in Los Angeles, sought an additional MMR shot, though she was vaccinated as a child, in case her immunity to measles was waning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For older adults who express more confidence in vaccine safety than younger groups, the past few months have brought some welcome research. Studies have found important benefits from a newer vaccine and enhanced versions of older ones, and one vaccine may confer a major bonus that nobody had foreseen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new studies are coming at a fraught political moment. The nation’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has long disparaged certain vaccines, calling them unsafe and saying that the government officials who regulate them are compromised and corrupt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, the secretary fired a panel of scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, replacing them with some who have been skeptical of vaccines. But so far, Kennedy has not tried to curb access to the shots for older Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence that vaccines are beneficial remains overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phrase “Vaccines are not just for kids anymore” has become a favorite for Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The population over 65, which often suffers the worst impact of respiratory viruses and others, now has the benefit of vaccines that can prevent much of that serious illness,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take influenza, which annually sends from 140,000 to 710,000 people to hospitals, most of them older than 65, and is fatal to 10% of those hospitalized older patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For about 15 years, the CDC has approved several enhanced flu vaccines for people older than 65. More effective than the standard formulation, they either contain higher levels of the antigen that builds protection against the virus or incorporate an adjuvant that creates a stronger immune response. Or they’re recombinant vaccines, developed through a different method, with higher antigen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a meta-analysis in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, “all the enhanced vaccine products were superior to the standard dose for preventing hospitalizations,” said Rebecca Morgan, a health research methodologist at Case Western Reserve University and an author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the standard flu shot, the enhanced vaccines reduced the risk of hospitalization from the flu by 11% to 18% in older adults. The CDC advises adults older than 65 to receive the enhanced vaccines, as many already do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More good news: Vaccines to prevent RSV in people older than 60 are performing admirably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSV is the most common cause of hospitalization for infants, and it also poses significant risks to older people. “Season in and season out,” Schaffner said, “it produces outbreaks of serious respiratory illness that rivals influenza.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the Food and Drug Administration first approved an RSV vaccine in 2023, the 2023-24 season provided “the first opportunity to see it in a real-world context,” said Dr. Pauline Terebuh, an epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine and an author of a recent study in the journal JAMA Network Open. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In analyzing electronic health records for almost 800,000 patients, the researchers found the vaccines to be 75% effective against acute infection, meaning illness that was serious enough to send a patient to a health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccines were 75% effective in preventing emergency room or urgent care visits, and 75% effective against hospitalization, both among those ages 60 to 74 and those older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immunocompromised patients, despite having a somewhat lower level of protection from the vaccine, will also benefit from it, Terebuh said. As for adverse effects, the study found a very low risk for Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare condition that causes muscle weakness and that typically follows an infection, in about 11 cases per 1 million doses of vaccine. That, she said, “shouldn’t dissuade people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC now recommends RSV vaccination for people 75 and older, and for those 60 to 74 if they’re at higher risk of severe illness (from heart disease, say).&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;p&gt;As data from the 2024-25 season becomes available, researchers hope to determine if the vaccine will remain a one-and-done, or whether immunity will require repeated vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People older than 65 express the greatest confidence in vaccine safety of any adult group, a KFF survey found in April. More than 80% said they were “very “or “somewhat confident” about MMR, shingles, pneumonia and flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the COVID vaccine drew lower support among all adults, more than two-thirds of older adults expressed confidence in its safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even skeptics might become excited about one possible benefit of the shingles vaccine: This spring, Stanford University researchers reported that over seven years, vaccination against shingles reduced the risk of dementia by 20%, a finding that made headlines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biases often undermine observational studies that compare vaccinated with unvaccinated groups. “People who are healthier and more health-motivated are the ones who get vaccinated,” said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an public health researcher at the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience at Stanford and lead author of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to know whether this is cause and effect,” he said, “or whether they’re less likely to develop dementia anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingPostscript" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Stanford team took advantage of a “natural experiment” when the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, was introduced in Wales. Health officials set a strict age cutoff: People who turned 80 on or before Sept. 1, 2013, weren’t eligible for vaccination, but those even slightly younger were eligible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sample of nearly 300,000 adults whose birthdays fell close to either side of that date, almost half of the eligible group received the vaccine, but virtually nobody in the older group did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just as in a randomized trial, these comparison groups should be similar in every way,” Geldsetzer explained. A substantial reduction in dementia diagnoses in the vaccine-eligible group, with a much stronger protective effect in women, therefore constitutes “more powerful and convincing evidence,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found reduced rates of dementia after the shingles vaccine was introduced in Australia and other countries. “We keep seeing this in one data set after another,” Geldsetzer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, where a more potent vaccine, Shingrix, became available in 2017 and supplanted Zostavax, Oxford investigators found an even stronger effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By matching almost 104,000 older Americans who received a first dose of the new vaccine (full immunization requires two) with a group that had received the earlier formulation, they found delayed onset of dementia in the Shingrix group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How a shingles vaccine might reduce dementia remains unexplained. Scientists have suggested that viruses themselves may contribute to dementia, so suppressing them could protect the brain. Perhaps the vaccine revs up the immune system in general or affects inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think anybody knows,” said Dr. Paul Harrison, a psychiatrist at Oxford and a senior author of the study. But, he added, “I’m now convinced there’s something real here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shingrix, now recommended for adults older than 50, is 90% effective in preventing shingles and the lingering nerve pain that can result. In 2021, however, only 41% of older Americans had received one dose of either shingles vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A connection to dementia will require further research, and Geldsetzer is trying to raise philanthropic funding for a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And “if you needed another reason to get this vaccine,” Schaffner said, “here it is.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers found that drinking one to three cups of coffee a day could help you live for longer, protecting you against potentially fatal heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, in &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002231662500286X?via%3Dihub"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, tracked the daily coffee consumption of 46,332 people over the age of 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow up of 11 years, they found black coffee and coffee with low levels of added sugar and saturated fat—like milk or cream—had a 14 per cent lower risk of death compared to no coffee consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;span&gt;one cup of black coffee a day, specifically, slashed the risk of death including cardiovascular death, by 16 per cent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who drank between two and three a day saw the risk lowered by 17 per cent.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers noted that the benefits peaked at three cups a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that those who added high amounts of sweeteners and dairy to their coffee did not experience the same benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers acknowledged, however, that the coffee consumption was self-reported by volunteers, so may have been underreported, limiting the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was also assessed without detailing the roast used and preparation methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

Researchers focused on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a brain region tied to emotional regulation, analyzing individual cell nuclei to map communication differences across PTSD, major depression, and control brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found impaired signaling in inhibitory neurons in PTSD, potentially explaining hyperarousal symptoms, and opposing patterns of microglial activity in PTSD versus depression. Vascular endothelial cells in PTSD brains also showed signs of dysfunction, possibly increasing stress hormone exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhibitory Neuron Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; PTSD brains showed decreased communication from inhibitory neurons, possibly causing hyperexcitable, overreactive brain states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microglia and Endothelial Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglia were overactive in depression but underactive in PTSD; endothelial cells in PTSD brains were also genetically altered, affecting stress hormone access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapeutic Pathways:&lt;/strong&gt; The study identified gene pathways that could be targeted with precision drugs developed specifically for PTSD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The human brain is made up of billions of interconnected cells that are constantly talking to each other. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study zooms in to the single-cell level to see how this cellular communication may be going wrong in brains affected by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111087"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/PTSD-cell-neurosicnec-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Unlike Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, which are associated with noticeable changes to the brain when imaged, scientists know very little about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, researchers did not have the technology to study genetic variation within individual cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now that it’s available, a team led by Matthew Girgenti, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at Yale School of Medicine, has been analyzing brain cells to uncover genetic variants that might be associated with psychiatric diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their latest study is one of the first to examine a major psychiatric disorder, PTSD, at the single-cell level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, doctors have been prescribing antidepressants to treat the condition because there are currently no drugs specifically designed for PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girgenti hopes that identifying novel molecular signatures associated with the psychiatric disease can help researchers learn how to develop new drugs or repurpose existing ones to treat it more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to figure out what’s gone wrong in psychiatric disorders so that we can understand the neurobiological mechanisms that are in play in these diseases,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The hope is that we can identify areas where we can potentially treat them—that’s the ultimate goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the researchers used postmortem human brain tissue from donors with and without PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also analyzed tissue from individuals who had been diagnosed with MDD—which is often diagnosed in people with PTSD—to better understand both the commonalities and where molecular mechanisms diverge between the conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, they looked at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with executive functioning and emotional regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the most uniquely human region of the brain,” Girgenti explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across all three groups, the researchers isolated individual cells from this brain region, paying particular attention to the nuclei, which package the cells’ DNA and make RNA. This allowed the team to observe genetic variation across the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key genome alterations revealed in brains with PTSD and MDD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among brains with PTSD, the analyses revealed gene alterations in a type of neuron known as inhibitory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are the fine-tuning neurons,” says Girgenti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They regulate other neurons and prevent them from overfiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brains with PTSD and MDD, the team observed a decrease in the amount of communication from these neurons. The researchers believe that this decrease in communication may contribute to a hyperexcitable state in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a traumatic event, this hyperexcitability could cause symptoms typically associated with PTSD such as hyperarousal (overreactive fight-or-flight response) and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered differences in the microglia, which are the brain’s immune cells. Interestingly, they found that these cells were overcommunicating in brains with MDD, but under communicating in those with PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“PTSD and MDD are generally very similar to each other and have a lot of shared genetic variability,” Girgenti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a finding that seems to differentiate the two.” His team hopes to further investigate these differences and how they might drive the two disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, they found that brains with PTSD also had genome alterations associated with dysregulated endothelial cells. These cells are part of the brain’s vasculature and interact with the rest of the body. Prior research has shown that individuals with PTSD have elevated levels of stress hormones, which travel to the brain through blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think there could be an increase in the amount of stress hormone that’s getting into the brain because these endothelial cells are compromised,” says Girgenti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Unlocking secrets of the brain to inform new therapies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, which are associated with noticeable changes to the brain when imaged, scientists know very little about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD. By zooming in to the molecular level, Girgenti hopes these insights will help lead to better therapies for the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already identified pathways—pathways refer to how genes talk to each other—that we think are targetable by particular drugs,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was only made possible by looking at those individual cells and those individual molecular changes. Now we have to try and find drugs that will reverse that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future studies, Girgenti’s team plans to examine other regions in the brain that might be involved in PTSD pathology such as the hypothalamus, which regulates the production of stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has been very well studied,” says Girgenti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But there are other regions of the brain that we know a lot less about, and they’re just as likely to hold secrets for what is wrong. And there could be even better regions to look at when it comes to therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research reported in this news article was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the State of Connecticut’s Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the National Institutes of Health (awards R01AA031017, DP1DA060811, R01NS128523, and R01HG012572) and Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this PTSD and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/ysm/profile/isabella-backman/#links-details-section" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Isabella Backman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Isabella Backman – Yale &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09083-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin dynamics of the human brain in PTSD&lt;/a&gt;” by Matthew Girgenti et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-cell transcriptomic and chromatin dynamics of the human brain in PTSD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a polygenic disorder occurring after extreme trauma exposure.

(WKRC) - An 11-year-old girl who beat cancer allegedly died after the hospital gave her "excessive" pain medication instead of properly treating her, prompting a lawsuit from her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a lawsuit obtained by&lt;em&gt; Law&amp;amp;Crime&lt;/em&gt;, 11-year-old Ava Wilson's family filed a lawsuit against Advocate Children's Hospital regarding the way the organization treated Wilson's follow-up treatment after she began remission for b-lymphoblastic leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family claimed that during a follow-up appointment on Oct. 29, 2020, they told staff that Wilson was having difficulty walking and was "crying in pain." Furthermore, lab tests reportedly found that the child had "low platelet counts, low blood cell counts, and high liver enzymes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Wilson was not held for further observation or treatment and was instead sent home with an increased prescription for morphine and gabapentin, the family claimed. This decision was reportedly "endorsed" by Wilson's regular oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of admitting Ava to the hospital to get her blood pressure, heart rate and pain levels within acceptable and normal limits, Advocate employees sent Ava home," said the trial's lead attorney, Matthew L. Williams. Williams claimed that the amount of medication given to Wilson was "excessive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days after the appointment, on October 31, Wilson died in her sleep due to lethal amounts of morphine in her system, the lawsuit claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family argued in its lawsuit that the new doses, 100 mg of gabapentin three times a day and 15 mg of morphine every four hours as needed, were much more than the child's previous prescription, and her attorney noted that if "taken together, the medications can make each other stronger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital's representatives argued that Wilson's health was in-line with leukemia complications, and that the prescribed medication was "within the recommended range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forensic neuropathologist testified during the trial that the child died due to the medication in her system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit finally concluded on June 10 when the jury agreed with the Wilson family and awarded them $20,500,000, citing "past and future loss of society and past and future grief, sorrow and mental suffering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 12:55:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>逐步淘汰NIH对HIV临床指南的支持的管理-《华盛顿邮报》 | Administration to phase out NIH support of HIV clinical guidelines - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxPUXZkQWZMdXBVczRLX01tZkNtT3cxV25Ndml3SFFZMlJBdHRINnVFQ0pEdmJWWHljOXM1dTQzM0gxSkhLNlFtUHBTb0ozYURkM1JPZzFEWWgxOFU4bkZ3bWdTVXFsMU1VR3BpLVJSWE5wRWNNWENGUXNpNGlac24zclVFOWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QL6L626OVVASLFWUEKPA25BW7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The National Institutes of Health’s support for federal guidelines that steer the treatment of more than a million HIV patients in the United States will be phased out by next June, according to the agency’s Office of AIDS Research, a move that troubled some doctors and raised questions about whether the guidelines themselves will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3WJBZ3AHOFAXLGWANTDJW3HICQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is unclear whether Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The results suggested that parental overprotection might lead to higher anxiety, which, in turn, reduces life satisfaction. Similarly, better parental care could lead to greater anger control, which may enhance life satisfaction. The research was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.2025.2473735"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parental bonding refers to the emotional connection and relationship that develops between a parent and their child, especially in early life. It involves feelings of warmth, closeness, and commitment to the child’s well-being. Strong parental bonding is essential for a child’s healthy emotional, social, and cognitive development. It fosters a sense of security and trust, forming the foundation for future relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factors that influence bonding include the parent’s mental health, sensitivity to the child’s needs, and the quality of early caregiving. Disrupted bonding—such as through neglect or inconsistency—can contribute to attachment difficulties and behavioral problems. Parental bonding is not fixed and can strengthen over time through positive interactions and responsive parenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Martina Smorti and her colleagues aimed to investigate the psychological processes linking parental bonding—specifically, the emotional connection with both mother and father—and life satisfaction. They focused on two dimensions of parental bonding: care and overprotection, and hypothesized that anger and anxiety might mediate the relationships between these dimensions and life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 369 Italian adults, with an average age of 22 years; 242 were women. About 72% had a college degree, 12% held a master’s degree, and 60% reported living with their family. Additionally, 69% reported that they were not currently employed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed self-report assessments of parental bonding (the Parental Bonding Instrument), anger expression and control (the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory–2), anxiety (the Beck Anxiety Inventory), and life satisfaction (the Satisfaction with Life Scale).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants who perceived higher levels of maternal or paternal care tended to exhibit better anger control and express anger less frequently. They also reported lower anxiety and greater life satisfaction. In contrast, participants who reported higher levels of parental overprotection—by either parent—tended to report higher anxiety, more frequent expression of anger, and lower life satisfaction. Greater anger control was associated with lower maternal overprotection but was not linked to paternal overprotection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested statistical models to determine whether anger and anxiety mediated the relationship between parental bonding and life satisfaction. The analyses suggested that anxiety may mediate the relationship between parental overprotection and life satisfaction—meaning that overprotective parenting might increase anxiety, which is then associated with lower life satisfaction. Similarly, anger control appeared to mediate the relationship between parental care and life satisfaction. Negative expressions of anger also seemed to mediate the link between maternal overprotection and life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings demonstrated that maternal and paternal bonding might play a role in the life satisfaction of young adults through different underlying psycho-emotional mechanisms,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study contributes to the scientific understanding of the psychological factors underlying the links between parental bonding and life satisfaction. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any definitive causal inferences to be derived from the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.2025.2473735"&gt;Exploring the Links Between Parental Bonding and Life Satisfaction: Anxiety and Anger as Underlying Mechanisms,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Martina Smorti, Cansu Alsancak-Akbulut, Francesca Pozza, and Carmen Berrocal Montiel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 12:08:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNTmItNEM0RFhsbFRtWXJ1Zk9jZ1FlUjFmVXpCM01haDhjMjdVRUxFeVBOVkdqbkZMMUl0ZG9TMTZuUW5Sekh4c3doUnFBaXZqeExWTnpyLUwwZXY0eTdFV0g1T2JmeU54emhxN0FXU1I2ZVJNNDY0aEZ2VTR6ZWYzd09PZ1hjVElMNW5BbE9zUnROSndfWDJiby1jMm10YVVM</guid></item><item><title>在研究中，慢性阻塞性肺疾病患者的肺部碳含量高于吸烟者-《华盛顿邮报》 | People with COPD had more carbon in their lungs than smokers in study - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOWkNwYkVJLTJ2MEpvcGZYaUpqX2VPT2kyUmNGNC1iS3RrY1RSdkdxSXlVLVRaVGMtZFAxVVBqWENyeVVuZHRIUFkwQ1JGT1MwdnJhNDlMN1NyV1Z6b2w4R3JmN2FEaVBSeEpWY0QzaFJlOFBjTDZTdFJ0eElocXhNbldtNGJ1ZjBPOF9vTGdKbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q5MEIO4TCVGA5I4FVQ6NGSU7YI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The lung tissue of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease contains triple the sootlike particle buildup found in similar tissue in smokers’ lungs, a recent analysis finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TJUKKUFLXJB2LP5P2WXGLKPYZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study found that COPD patients’ &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513313/" target="_blank"&gt;alveolar macrophages&lt;/a&gt; — a type of lung cell that removes dust, particles and microorganisms from the lungs — contain more carbon than those of smokers.

							&lt;p data-start="152" data-end="547"&gt;We all know someone who seems to glide through the decades with the same energy and sparkle they had at twenty‑five. They’re not blessed by genetics alone—they practise small, repeatable habits that science links with slower biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="152" data-end="547"&gt;Below are nine of the most compelling morning rituals I’ve found in the literature (and tried myself) that appear to keep Father Time on the back foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="554" data-end="615"&gt;1. They greet the sunrise instead of the snooze button&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="616" data-end="1127"&gt;Early exposure to natural light anchors your circadian rhythm, lowers evening melatonin at the right time, and, remarkably, is associated with longer telomeres—the shoelace tips of your DNA that fray as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="616" data-end="1127"&gt;A Mendelian‑randomisation &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10558505/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that a “morning chronotype” correlates with reduced telomere attrition, while daily‑diary research shows that as little as 20 minutes of morning sunlight predicts better sleep that night—another youth‑preserving dividend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1131" data-end="1276"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1131" data-end="1140"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Pull back the curtains, open a window, and let dawn light hit your eyes (without sunglasses) while you breathe for five calmer minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1283" data-end="1329"&gt;2. They meditate before they caffeinate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1330" data-end="1755"&gt;Stress accelerates biological ageing; mindfulness turns down the dial. Reviews by Nobel‑Prize laureate Elizabeth Blackburn and colleagues suggest that meditation dampens stress reactivity and may preserve telomere length over time. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3057175/"&gt;2021 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; came to similar conclusions. In plain English: ten quiet minutes on the cushion today can translate into younger cells tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1759" data-end="1892"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1759" data-end="1768"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Sit upright, count ten slow breaths, and notice the feel of the air. If your mind bolts, that’s normal—gently call it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1899" data-end="1947"&gt;3. They move their bodies (gently counts)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1948" data-end="2449"&gt;From brisk walking to sun‑salutation yoga, morning movement supplies oxygen, stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, and is repeatedly linked to slower biological age. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10274991/"&gt;Long‑term physical‑activity studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10572212/"&gt;large U.S. datasets&lt;/a&gt; show that regular running or jogging corresponds with longer leukocyte telomeres and lower all‑cause mortality. You don’t need to be an ultramarathoner—20‑30 minutes of moderate exertion is enough to switch on the anti‑ageing machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2453" data-end="2575"&gt;&lt;em data-start="2453" data-end="2462"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Lace up before breakfast. I run 4–5 km at conversational pace, then stretch—my mood (and skin) thank me all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="2582" data-end="2646"&gt;4. They rehydrate before anything else touches their lips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2647" data-end="3050"&gt;Ageing cells shrink when chronically dehydrated. An &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2023/good-hydration-linked-healthy-aging"&gt;NIH‑led cohort&lt;/a&gt; found that adults whose serum‑sodium levels signalled sub‑optimal hydration were up to 50 % more likely to present a “biological age” older than their actual years, and had higher premature‑mortality risk. Two tall glasses of water on rising &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/good-hydration-linked-healthy-aging?"&gt;help the brain&lt;/a&gt;, kidneys, and skin start the day fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3054" data-end="3158"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3054" data-end="3063"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Keep a carafe on your night stand. Down 500 ml, then chase it with whatever hot brew you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="3165" data-end="3229"&gt;5. They eat an antioxidant‑rich, protein‑steady breakfast&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3230" data-end="3711"&gt;Mountains of oxidative‑stress research point to berries, nuts, greens, and quality proteins as first‑line defenders against cellular damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3230" data-end="3711"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/13/4/394"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em data-start="3382" data-end="3396"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt; and other journals emphasise that diets dense in polyphenols, vitamin C, and plant fats correlate with healthier ageing trajectories. Translation: swap sugary cereal for Greek yoghurt, blueberries, chia, and a handful of almonds and you’re feeding your cells’ clean‑up crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3715" data-end="3811"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3715" data-end="3724"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; I blend spinach, frozen berries, pea protein, and oat milk—five minutes, zero excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="3818" data-end="3864"&gt;6. They scribble a quick gratitude line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3865" data-end="4220"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/experiencing-gratitude-associated-with-greater-longevity-among-older-adults/"&gt;Harvard‑Chan School analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 49,000 older women found that those scoring highest on a gratitude questionnaire had a 9 % lower risk of death over four years, even after controlling for health behaviours. Gratitude lowers inflammatory markers and boosts positive affect, both known moderators of ageing pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4224" data-end="4376"&gt;&lt;em data-start="4224" data-end="4233"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Write one thing you’re thankful for on a sticky note. Stick it to the kettle. The repetition rewires the default‑mode network toward optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="4383" data-end="4419"&gt;7. They delay the doom‑scroll&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;Smartphones spike cortisol and fragment attention—two ageing accelerants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/dealing-with-smartphone-stress"&gt;Clinical commentary&lt;/a&gt; from Australia’s College of GPs links intensive phone use with higher self‑reported stress and disturbed cortisol rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;By keeping screens off for the first 30 minutes, slow‑agers guard that fragile morning calm and let their HPA‑axis warm up naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4814" data-end="4907"&gt;&lt;em data-start="4814" data-end="4823"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Activate “do not disturb” until you’ve finished breakfast. Your inbox will survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="4914" data-end="4962"&gt;8. They apply sunscreen—yes, even indoors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5380"&gt;Photo‑ageing accounts for up to 80 % of visible facial ageing. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/"&gt;landmark randomised trial&lt;/a&gt; proved that daily broad‑spectrum SPF 30 slowed wrinkle formation and hyper‑pigmentation in middle‑aged adults, independent of genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5380"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/sunscreen-and-your-morning-routine"&gt;Johns Hopkins dermatologists echo:&lt;/a&gt; apply after cleansing, before makeup, every single morning. Your skin will quite literally look younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5384" data-end="5472"&gt;&lt;em data-start="5384" data-end="5393"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Keep a pump bottle beside your toothbrush. Habit stacking beats forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="5479" data-end="5534"&gt;9. They plot one purpose‑driven goal for the day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2740716/?"&gt;Longevity research&lt;/a&gt; shows that having a “sense of purpose” predicts lower mortality risk, even when health, wealth, and personality are controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;Rolling out of bed and deciding “what one thing will make today meaningful?” primes dopamine circuits and sustains motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;Over months, that goal‑orientation supports healthier behaviours and social ties—keys to ageing slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5956" data-end="6064"&gt;&lt;em data-start="5956" data-end="5965"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Write your single, soulful intention on a note card and carry it in your wallet. Re‑read at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6071" data-end="6097"&gt;Bringing it together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6098" data-end="6380"&gt;You’ll notice none of these practices require expensive gadgets or eight‑step biohacking regimes. They’re simple, repeatable, and grounded in psychology’s favourite anti‑ageing levers: lower chronic stress, tighter circadian rhythms, stable metabolic health, and positive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6382" data-end="6622"&gt;My challenge to you: choose &lt;strong data-start="6410" data-end="6417"&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; habit tomorrow morning and stick with it for a week. Then layer another. Ageing may be inevitable, but the &lt;em data-start="6525" data-end="6531"&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; at which we age is negotiable—and the negotiation begins before 9 a.m. See you at sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Creatine — long beloved by gym rats who mix it into protein shakes — is shaping up to be much more than a muscle building and fat loss supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounting research suggests it may also boost &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cardiologist-shares-easy-way-avoid-biggest-calorie-heart-health-mistake-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;, protect against &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facing-early-onset-alzheimers-how-family-copes-with-genetic-fate-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, improve mood, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/calcium-rich-dairy-free-foods-to-build-strong-bones-2019-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;strengthen your bones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researchers typically have a healthy &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/supplements-myths-us-top-supplement-expert-2024-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;mistrust of supplements&lt;/a&gt;, creatine is the rare exception, recommended even among skeptical scientists and doctors: it's reliably safe, relatively inexpensive, and backed by extensive, high-quality studies. And it costs, on average, less than 50 cents per serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if there's anything on the planet that comes close to creatine from a multifactorial approach," Darren Candow, a top creatine researcher and professor of exercise physiology, nutrition and aging at Regina University in Canada, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, interest in creatine has skyrocketed, in tandem with research showing it can double up as a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-longevity-doctor-takes-these-3-supplements-daily-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity supplement&lt;/a&gt;.

Nearly a century later, scientists started to figure out how it's stored and used for energy in the human body. They experimented with extracting creatine from meat and later synthesizing it in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn't until the Barcelona &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-surprises-attending-paris-olympics-regular-person-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 that creatine went mainstream. The British gold-medal sprinters, sharing how they got in shape, gushed about the powerful effects of a little-known supplement: creatine. In 1993, the first commercial creatine hit store shelves, and sales boomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a raw material for producing ATP, a molecule that gives our cells energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of creatine is stored in the muscles, where it offers a ready fuel source for high-intensity effort. More creatine can improve strength and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/muscle-building-potential-gains-progress-monthly-trainer-2022-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;muscle gains&lt;/a&gt; by providing a bit more energy, helping you push a little bit harder and work out for longer before getting tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies naturally produce creatine through a combination of amino acids. That's only a small amount, though. We can get more of it from some foods like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/red-meat" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and fish — or, through supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past five years, demand for creatine as a fitness aid has spiked, with retail prices up 150% and sales increased by 90% year over year, despite steadily rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's not just for muscle-hungry gym bros.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;While men continue to make up the majority of creatine users, about 21% of the creatine buyers are women, according to data from nationwide supplement retailers The Vitamin Shoppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At SuppCo, both Glen, the CSO, and Steve Martocci, the CEO, said their wives have recently started taking creatine — reflecting a broader trend of women as a growing consumer base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martocci pointed to more evidence dispelling the myth that creatine is just for muscle men to bulk up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/16/3567" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;early research&lt;/a&gt; suggests creatine can support hormonal health for women, helping to counteract shifts that can occur during the menstrual cycle by helping to maintain levels of glycogen in the muscle for better energy and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f485d814-927b-420c-83c8-ed0f2b157411" data-toc-id="f485d814-927b-420c-83c8-ed0f2b157411"&gt;Creatine slows aging and boosts brain health, per new research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, a small study found that patients with Alzheimer's disease saw a boost to their &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brain-ages-more-57-70-78-protein-exercise-sleep-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; after supplementing creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that just providing more energy to the brain could be useful," Scott Forbes, a sports science researcher and professor at Brandon University who was not involved in the study, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The brain actually uses about 20% of your total energy expenditure, even though it only weighs about 2% of your body weight. So for a tissue, it's very energetically demanding," Forbes said.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Creatine also seems to have an anti-inflammatory effect, making the brain more resilient against stresses that would wear down its ability to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that too much inflammation or too much oxidative stress can also lead to poor cognition or poor brain functions," Forbes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other recent studies have found that supplementing creatine could also help to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-age-you-faster-make-you-look-older-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;mitigate the effects of aging&lt;/a&gt; or a concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The theory is that the brain can remodel itself or at least maintain its function during times of stress," Candow, the aging researcher at Regina University, told Business Insider. "I don't know anybody in the world that's not stressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research is expanding creatine's reach to consumers beyond the gym, according to Muriel Gonzalez, president of nationwide supplement retailer The Vitamin Shoppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Creatine is undergoing a major transformation — from a niche sports nutrition supplement to a versatile tool for daily health and longevity," Gonzalez told Business Insider over email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total creatine sales have spiked by 300% from 2019 to 2024 at The Vitamin Shoppe, and are continuing to grow at a double-digit pace, according to company data.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;You'll be disappointed if you expect to transform your life, and health, with a few doses of creatine. A supplement can provide a boost but ultimately makes a relatively small difference. Your overall diet, exercise, and lifestyle are far more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the bottom line is that more and more research supports taking creatine for a huge range of benefits, with very little downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think almost everybody should consider taking creatine," Forbes, the science researcher at Brandon University, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in high doses over a long time period, side effects are mild, such as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/stomach-ache" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastrointestinal upset&lt;/a&gt; and a slight increase in water retention, since creatine pulls water into the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall it's one of the safest supplements out there," Eric Gonzalez, a neuroscience professor at Texas Christian University who has studied creatine, told Business Insider. "If anyone wants to go on a supplement, creatine won't hurt you, there's only going to be an upside."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're losing weight — including those on a GLP-1 drug that triggers weight loss — creatine can help you retain muscle mass, promoting a higher ratio of muscle to body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-ways-to-improve-your-mood-according-to-psychologists" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;boost brain health or mood&lt;/a&gt;, early studies suggest that 10-30 grams a day may be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glen previously conducted research on senior Olympians who took creatine and found it helped them get stronger and faster while avoiding age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're never too old to take creatine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Despite the profound human, social and economic costs of alcohol abuse, existing treatments have failed to provide meaningful relief. Excessive alcohol consumption remains a leading cause of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240096745"&gt;death and disability worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. In the U.S. alone, &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health/national-releases/2023"&gt;16.4 million people&lt;/a&gt; age 12 and older reported binge drinking on five or more days in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are several drugs available to those seeking to stop or lower their alcohol consumption, their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2015.1133472"&gt;effectiveness is limited&lt;/a&gt;, and they often have significant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three decades, efforts to treat excessive drinking have focused primarily on developing drugs that target proteins that can control how neurons respond to stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these proteins are present in almost every neuron throughout the brain, the drugs also affect neurons that aren't directly responsible for regulating alcohol's effects. This often leads to unwanted side effects like headache, fatigue, drowsiness or insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my work &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gilles-Martin-3"&gt;as a neurobiologist&lt;/a&gt;, I study the idea that pinpointing the specific brain circuits that play a role in suppressing alcohol consumption is critical to developing targeted treatments with limited side effects. In my newly published research, my team and I identified a small cluster of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;neurons responsible for suppressing binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A map of binge drinking neurons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.mp.4000206"&gt;identified several brain regions&lt;/a&gt; that play a key role in alcohol abuse. But there has been strong evidence that only a very small number of neurons within these regions underpinned the effects of the drug on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small populations of neurons, called &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/memories-of-the-good-parts-of-using-drugs-can-keep-people-hooked-altering-the-neurons-that-store-them-could-help-treat-addiction-245529"&gt;neuronal ensembles&lt;/a&gt;, have been shown to play a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2015.07.009"&gt;key role&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11028"&gt;memory formation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35379803"&gt;experiencing fear&lt;/a&gt;. However, researchers haven't known whether the neuronal ensembles activated during binge drinking also influence binge drinking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000437413"&gt;billions of neurons&lt;/a&gt; contained in the brain, the task of identifying these neurons is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. To solve this challenge, my colleagues and I used a genetically modified mouse model that, upon exposure to alcohol, activates a gene coding for a red fluorescent protein that is selectively expressed in alcohol-sensitive neurons. By tracing these fluorescent neurons, we were able to make a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;map of the precise locations of affected neurons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified a discrete number of neurons that respond to binge drinking in a brain region called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.01.010"&gt;medial orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;. This area is known for its key role in controlling decision-making and adapting behavior to a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that turning this neuronal ensemble off resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;sharp increase of alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This means that the brain has, in essence, a built-in regulation system that is activated during alcohol drinking to act as a brake on its consumption. Should these neurons misfire, the regulatory system would fail, possibly leading to uncontrolled drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this study advances our understanding of how and where binge drinking modulates brain function in mice, it remains unclear whether human brains are also equipped with the same neuronal ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they are, stimulating these neurons may provide a path toward helping people who experience difficulty controlling their alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although selective control of neuronal activity is a formidable challenge, &lt;a href="https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2016/04/newsweek-umass-medical-school-develops-gene-therapy-for-rare-neurodegenerative-disease/"&gt;progress in gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; for patients with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="165378" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other rare diseases offers hope for more effective alcohol use disorder treatments with fewer side effects.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257217/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Millions of Americans have high cholesterol, which can lead to heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bedtime snack rich in fiber and plant protein may help lower cholesterol. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a cholesterol-lowering late-night snack, our Chia Seed Pudding checks all the boxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, you’re not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, millions of Americans have high cholesterol (aka hyperlipidemia).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This condition, defined as total blood &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels higher than 200 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, is a leading risk factor for heart disease. However, that doesn’t mean you’re destined for heart troubles. “Keeping cholesterol levels in a healthy range helps reduce the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/registered-dietitians#kathleen-benson" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kathleen Benson, RDN, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, healthy meals are the foundation of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering diet&lt;/a&gt;. But snacks can help, too—even the ones you eat before bed, like our ​​&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt;. It’s loaded with ingredients that can help reduce cholesterol. Yet, it’s light and satisfying enough that it won’t mess with your sleep. No wonder dietitians are huge fans. Here’s how it can help keep your heart healthy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the myriad benefits of enjoying a high-fiber diet is that it can help lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When I have a client trying to manage high cholesterol levels, we focus on getting more fiber and healthier fats in their diet,” says &lt;a href="https://bebalancednutritionrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meggie Connelly, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Filled with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, our Chia Seed Pudding delivers a hefty 11 grams of fiber per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds contain a mix of both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But it’s their soluble fiber that’s behind chia’s cholesterol-lowering powers. The reason? Soluble fiber can absorb some of the cholesterol in your gut, removing it from the body before it can cause trouble. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Low in Saturated Fat &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, research has shown that cholesterol from food doesn’t always affect your blood cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The real culprit is saturated fat, found mainly in full-fat dairy, red and processed meat, lard and ghee. Saturated fat tells your liver to rev up its cholesterol production, which provides far more cholesterol than the amount we absorb from food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this chia pudding is made with almond milk, it contains merely 1 gram of saturated fat per serving. If almond milk isn’t your thing, feel free to sub in another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based milk&lt;/a&gt; like soy, cashew or oat milk or low-fat cow’s milk. Just steer clear of coconut milk and full-fat cow’s milk, which are both high in saturated fat. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Plant Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you have high cholesterol or not, choosing a late-night snack that contains some protein is the key to staying satiated all night long. “This will help you feel full during the night and help control blood sugar levels so you’re not starving by the morning,” says&lt;a href="https://www.brannoninbalancenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brannon Blount, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Each serving of this chia pudding delivers 7 grams of protein. And not just any kind of protein. All of its protein is plant protein, which has been linked to better heart health. It’s so beneficial that the American Heart Association recommends getting most of our protein from plant sources like the chia seeds and nuts in this recipe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-heart-healthy-bedtime-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Heart-Healthy Bedtime Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A combination of fiber and protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider this the magic duo. “Fiber and protein combined, or paired together with an assortment of foods, can support steady blood sugar and satiety,” Benson says. That’s important because chronically high blood sugar levels can lead to diabetes, which increases heart disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients that are easy to digest.&lt;/strong&gt; When you’re trying to get some quality zzz’s, the last thing you need to eat is something that will upset your tummy or delay sleep even further. Choose something light, easy to digest and satisfying, yet low in fat and added sugars. In addition to chia pudding, oatmeal, popcorn and cereal with low-fat milk are all great options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something simple to assemble. &lt;/strong&gt;After a long day, it’s normal to experience some decision fatigue. But, instead of reaching for something with empty calories (we’re looking at you, bag of chips), choose something nutrient-dense that you can easily whip up. “Your late-night snack needs to be quick and easy to put together, like a banana and nut butter, or a peanut butter and sliced strawberry sandwich on whole-grain bread. Or make your chia pudding in advance,” says Connelly. “If you have to spend 30 minutes making your late-night snack, it’s not going to be something you do consistently.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking may get a bad rap, but if you didn’t eat enough during the day, a little nibble before bed might help you fall and stay asleep. That said, if you have high cholesterol, there are some considerations to keep in mind. If cholesterol is an issue, dietitians recommend choosing a snack that’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in fiber, low in saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and contains some protein. Our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; checks all the boxes. So, whip some up today. You can double (or even quadruple) the recipe. And it will stay fresh in your fridge for up to three days for a hassle-free bedtime snack your heart will thank you for. &lt;br&gt;

Sometimes these mood swings can and should be examined as cause for concern, but a few TikTok creators explained how it's also good to take a step back and analyze our feelings before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anania00" rel="nofollow"&gt;TikTok content creator Anania&lt;/a&gt; told their followers that after eating, all of the depressive thoughts they were having before had simply gone away. Many people were quick to agree, while other content creators were able to put a name to that phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There are four things we should ask ourselves using the HALT technique before beginning to spiral:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's consider, though, I'm not a [expletive] and I'm just hungry at this moment, you know what I mean?" &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anania00/video/7248847178918169902" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anania began in their video&lt;/a&gt;. "Then we might be able to start our healing journey as a unit because I haven't thought about suicide in the past 20 minutes, and I just had a 3-piece from Popeye's. There's a correlation here, is all I'm saying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Anania's initial video was meant to be humorous, it sparked a conversation about how many of our negative emotions are often tied to simple issues that can be solved — i.e., eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/things-ask-ourselves-using-halt-before-spiraling.png" alt="woman using the HALT technique to determine she's hungry and not spiraling" title="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using The HALT Technique Before Spiraling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Photology1971 | Shutterstock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/stop-obsessive-negative-thoughts-become-positive-person"&gt;5 Simple Ways To Combat Obsessive Negative Thoughts — And Become A More Positive Person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Am I hungry?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zairell777/video/7250268182869478699" rel="nofollow"&gt;video stitching Anania's original clip&lt;/a&gt;, another content creator, @zairell777, pointed out that there is a way we can look within ourselves to stop our emotions from spiraling. "This person is spot [expletive] on," she said of Anania's revelation that they felt better after having a meal. She explained that it's part of a DBT skill that she had learned and was called HALT, an acronym for Hunger, Anger, Lonely, and Tired.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're feeling anything negative, if you feel any negative emotions [or] you're having some negative thought patterns, run down the list and then act accordingly," she continued. "Were you suicidal or did you just need some chicken?" She acknowledged that while that's not the case all the time, for many occurrences, being in a negative headspace can easily be solved by eating. The phenomenon, also called being "hangry," isn't an irrational feeling to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269629" rel="nofollow"&gt;findings published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269629" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, data showed that hunger was associated with 37% of changes in irritability, 34% in anger, and 38% in pleasure, suggesting that these emotions were caused by fluctuations in hunger. Researchers have even found that low blood glucose levels can trigger irritability, causing people to have a shorter fuse than usual when hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Am I angry?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger isn't exactly a pleasant emotional state, but it is completely normal, and it's important to acknowledge that. Psychiatrist and addiction specialist David Streem, MD, is a proponent of using the HALT method and he explained, “Just because you feel angry doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you,” he told the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/halt-hungry-angry-lonely-tired" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “But chronic, persistent anger is unhealthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to make that distinction. He went on to say, “Focus on who’s in the driver’s seat. When I’m upset and it’s time to move on to my next activity — to go home, to go to work — I should be able to turn that off and let it go in a real way, not just packing it down. That way, in my next activity, I can be present when I’m with my family or working with co-workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/reason-you-cant-get-past-anger"&gt;turn that anger off&lt;/a&gt;, and essentially move on, as Dr. Streem described, then you have a good grasp on your emotions and don't have cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-carrying-more-anger-realize"&gt;5 Signs You Might Be Carrying More Anger Than You Realize, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Am I lonely?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and feeling isolated can open the door to intrusive thoughts, which is why experts agree it's important, when you're feeling vulnerable, to determine if what you really need is human connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://cl.kp.org/natl/home/refcontainerpage.dam.nohf.public.html?damrefpath=/content/dam/clinicallibrary/scal/mem_ed/healthed/nutrition_month/chl035e-8.pdf&amp;amp;accessvia=scal_chl" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kaiser Permanente&lt;/a&gt; shared, once you have isolated loneliness as the cause for your negative emotions, you can take action by reaching out to loved ones. Additionally, you can make a plan to increase your community by joining local clubs or even trying out a new hobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/things-ask-ourselves-using-halt-before-spiraling-am-i-lonely.png" alt="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using HALT Technique Before Spiraling, Am I Lonely" title="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using The HALT Technique Before Spiraling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Dmytro Sheremeta | Shutterstock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lacyhartselle/video/7213437985717620014" rel="nofollow"&gt;In another video,&lt;/a&gt; TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lacyhartselle" rel="nofollow"&gt;creator Lacy&lt;/a&gt; expanded on how we can use HALT to check in with ourselves if we feel our emotions spiraling. "This is a good way to assess yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed or vulnerable and your thoughts are starting to spiral," Lacy said of the acronym. "Do I need to express some feelings here? Am I lonely? Do I need to phone a friend or at least journal to myself?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacy explained that HALT can help us catch ourselves before we turn our negative emotions and thoughts onto another person. "Am I Hungry? Am I Angry? Am I Lonely? Am I Tired? Do I need to address these things?" She added, "After you take action to meet your own needs and to check in with yourself, you can function from a more clear-headed and balanced space." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Am I tired?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like hunger, being tired is a physical state that can impact our emotions. As Dr. Streem stated, “Fatigue is like being hungry — it’s a condition that affects the brain.” It's as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habit-well-rested-people-use-fall-asleep-quickly"&gt;aren't getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; or you've even just had one bad bout of tossing and turning, acknowledging it allows you to make a simple action plan to help yourself. You can commit to a new sleep routine, cut out caffeine after noon, set a reasonable bedtime, or even indulge in some nice new bedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In the comments section, many people agreed with being able to use 'HALT' to assess their emotions.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For about a week, I was tracking my mood as part of a challenge from another app. Realized I started spiraling around 2:30 most days. Just needed food," one TikTok user pointed out.

                    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. logged fewer than 20 measles cases this week, though Iowa announced the state’s first outbreak Thursday and Georgia confirmed its second Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 1,214 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation’s biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed six cases in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=3d8451977cd34084a8b494a6a11b4f1a&amp;amp;sc_lang=en&amp;amp;hash=48D1A6D0D037B39BD421AAF060204EE0"&gt;2,179 cases&lt;/a&gt; from mid-October through June 17. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/diseases-know-no-borders-measles-spreads-with-outbreaks-in-canada-mexico-and-u-s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘Diseases know no borders’: Measles spreads with outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/measles"&gt;996 as of Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,335 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. states with active outbreaks — which the CDC defines as three or more related cases — include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 750 cases across &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7"&gt;35 counties, most of them in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, state health officials said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the outbreak, 97 people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;State health officials estimated&lt;/a&gt; less than 1% of cases — fewer than 10 — are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 413 cases since late January — just under 2% of its residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many measles cases are there in New Mexico?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Doña Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma added one case Friday for a total of 17 confirmed and three probable cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Arizona?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona has four cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said June 9. All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Colorado?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has seen a total of 16 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of 10 related cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May. Four of the people were on the flight with the first case — an out-of-state traveler not included in the state count — while five got measles from exposure in the airport and one elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are also tracking an unrelated case in a Boulder County resident. The person was fully vaccinated but had “recently traveled to Europe, where there are a large number of measles cases,” the state health department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Georgia?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia has an outbreak of three cases in metro Atlanta, with the most recent infection confirmed Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has confirmed six total cases in 2025. The remaining three are part of an unrelated outbreak from January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Illinois?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following weeks, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Iowa?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa has had six total measles cases in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four are part of an outbreak in eastern Johnson County, among members of the same household. County health officials said the people are isolating at home, so they don’t expect additional spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; has a total of 79 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but three of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Montana?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montana had 22 measles cases as of Friday. Fourteen were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up — Montana’s first in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in North Dakota?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Dakota, which hadn’t seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized. All of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials declared earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania over after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee’s outbreak also appears to be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year. Most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — due to “herd immunity.” But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOISE, Idaho — Health officials confirmed Wednesday that a bat discovered in downtown Boise earlier this week has tested positive for rabies, prompting warnings for people who may have encountered the animal.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Central District Health, the infected bat was found in front of the Owyhee Building on Main Street. Laboratory results confirming the rabies diagnosis were received on June 18.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department emphasized that while most bats do not carry rabies, the virus poses serious health risks to both humans and animals. Anyone who may have had close contact with the bat should consult their primary care physician about potential rabies vaccination and contact Central District Health epidemiologists at (208) 375-5211.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery serves as a reminder of the importance of proper safety protocols when encountering bats, which play a crucial role in local ecosystems. Central District Health advises people to never handle bats with their bare hands and to use thick, protective gloves when necessary to contain the animals for testing.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pet owners are urged to ensure their animals, including cats, receive current rabies vaccinations since domestic animals may encounter bats both outdoors and inside homes.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can reduce their risk of rabies exposure by bat-proofing their properties with tight-fitting window screens and sealing entry points. Bats can squeeze through openings as small as a quarter. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central District Health offers additional rabies prevention resources on its &lt;a href="https://cdh.idaho.gov/environmental-health/hazards/bats-and-rabies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, along with information from the &lt;a href="https://idfg.idaho.gov/press/protect-people-protect-bats-and-avoid-rabies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Idaho Fish and Game&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="https://healthandwelfare.idaho.gov/health-wellness/diseases-conditions/rabies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; Idaho Department of Health and Welfare&lt;/a&gt;, regarding bat safety and home protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
